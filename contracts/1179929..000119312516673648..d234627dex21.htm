doubt, Purchaser shall have the right under this Agreement to (a) purchase,
acquire, take assignment and delivery of any and all of the Purchased Assets

forth on Section 2.05 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules (the "Approved

actions (i) relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder or enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of Seller to Purchaser under this Agreement or
any other agreement executed in connection herewith or (ii) delay or prevent
the Closing or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other agreement executed in connection herewith; _provided, however_ ,
that it is acknowledged and agreed that Purchaser may cause one or more of the
Approved Subsidiaries to purchase, acquire, take assignment of and receive all

made pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be made promptly and, if so requested
by a receiving party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in writing by the receiving party to the paying party.
Each paying party shall provide written notice to the other party of any
payment made pursuant to this Section 2.06 when such payment is made.

 



-17- Section 2.07 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, (a) as soon as possible, but in no
event later than three Business Days, following satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6 by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) or (b) at such other time and/or place as may be mutually agreed upon
by the parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

Section 2.08 ___Closing Deliveries_ _._ At the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall
pay $7,549,105.70 (the "Closing Payment") to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account of Seller designated by Seller prior

shall enter into (i) unless Purchaser is entering into the Conveyed Medicare
Advantage Contracts directly with CMS, a CMS Novation Agreement in the form
required by CMS for the novation or assignment of the Conveyed Medicare
Advantage Contracts to Purchaser (the "Novation Agreement"), (ii) an
Administrative Services Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule A_ (the "Administrative Services Agreement"), (iii) a Transitional
Trademark License Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule B_ (the "Transitional Trademark License Agreement") and (iv) an
Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Schedule C_ (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that if the form of Novation
Agreement required by CMS for the novation or assignment of the Conveyed
Medicare Advantage Contracts contains terms and conditions that are not
customarily found in a CMS novation agreement and such terms and conditions
would result in any of the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts no longer
constituting a "Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contract" as defined herein, the
form of such Novation Agreement shall be subject to the prior approval of
Seller and Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 2.09 ___Purchase Price Adjustment_ _._

 

(a) Within 30 calendar days after Purchasers receipt of the monthly
membership roster issued by CMS in the second (2nd) month following the later
of (x) the Enrollee Measurement Date and (y) the end of any Special Opt Out
Period (such 30-calendar day period, the "Purchase Price Calculation Period"
and such monthly CMS membership roster, the "Monthly Membership Report", which
Purchase Price Calculation Period shall be extended for up to an additional 30
calendar days if Purchaser makes a written request of Seller prior to the
expiration of the initial Purchase Price Calculation Period reasonably
documenting the reason for such extension), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
(i) a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth
Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price, which shall be calculated based
solely on the number of Purchaser Enrollees as of the first date that is on or
after the later of the Enrollee Measurement Date and the end of any Special
Opt Out Period as shown on the Monthly Membership Report (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, will not be based, in whole or in part, on any other
information including any records of Seller, Purchaser or any other
Person, including CMS) and (ii) a copy of the Monthly Membership Report. For
purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:

 

"Purchase Price" means an amount in cash equal to the sum of all Regional
Purchase Prices.

 



-18- "Regional Purchase Price" means, for each Region, an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the number of Purchaser Enrollees as of the first date
that is on or after the later of the Enrollee Measurement Date and the end of
any Special Opt Out Period as shown on the Monthly Membership Report who
reside in such Region as set forth on the Monthly Membership Report and (ii)
the dollar amount per Enrollee set forth opposite the name of such Region on
Section 2.09(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

(b) If Purchaser fails to deliver the Post-Closing Statement and the Monthly
Membership Report during the Purchase Price Calculation Period (including any
extension of the Purchase Price Calculation Period in accordance with Section
2.09(a)), Purchaser shall still be required to deliver to Seller the Monthly
Membership Report in accordance with Section 2.09(a) and if such report
is not delivered, Purchaser authorizes Seller to request such report directly
from CMS, and authorizes CMS to deliver such report directly to Seller, and,
in such event, upon receipt of the Monthly Membership Report from Purchaser or
CMS, as applicable, Seller shall be entitled to calculate the Purchase Price
based solely on the Monthly Membership Report, and such amount, as calculated
by Seller, shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all
purposes of this Agreement. 

(c) If Purchaser delivers the Post-Closing Statement and the Monthly
Membership Report during the Purchase Price Calculation Period (including any
extension of the Purchase Price Calculation Period in accordance with Section
2.09(a)) and Seller disagrees with Purchasers calculation of the Purchase
Price set forth on the Post-Closing Statement, Seller may, within 30 calendar
days after receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, deliver a notice (a "Notice
of Disagreement") to Purchaser which notice shall describe the nature of any
such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved,
and specify Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price. If Seller delivers to
Purchaser a notice accepting the Post-Closing Statement, or does not timely
deliver any Notice of Disagreement, Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Post-Closing Statement.

(d) If Seller timely delivers a Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller
shall, during the 30 calendar days after delivery thereof, use their
respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
matters in order to determine the Purchase Price. If Purchaser and Seller are
unable to reach agreement as to the Purchase Price during such 30-calendar
day period, then either party may bring an Action to determine the Purchase
Price in the courts provided for by Section 9.07.

 

(e) If the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Payment, then
Purchaser shall pay the amount of such difference to Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account specified by Seller prior to such
payment. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment,
Seller shall pay the amount of such difference to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Purchaser.
The payment required to be made by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable,
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentences will be made within three
Business Days of the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price.

 



-19- (f) "Adjusted Purchase Price" means (i) if Purchaser does not deliver
the Post-Closing Statement and the Monthly Membership Report during the
Purchase Price Calculation Period (including any extension of the Purchase
Price Calculation Period in accordance with Section 2.09(a)), Sellers
calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.09(b); (ii) if
Purchaser delivers the Post-Closing Statement and the Monthly Membership
Report during the Purchase Price Calculation Period (including any extension
of the Purchase Price Calculation Period in accordance with Section 2.09(a)),
and Seller does not deliver any Notice of Disagreement within 30 calendar days
after receipt of the Post-Closing Statement or Seller delivers a notice
accepting the Post-Closing Statement, Purchasers calculation of the Purchase
Price set forth on the Post-Closing Statement; or (iii) if Seller does deliver
a Notice of Disagreement within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Post-
Closing Statement, (A) the Purchase Price as agreed by Purchaser and Seller
pursuant to Section 2.09(d) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, the
Purchase Price as determined in any Action brought by either party pursuant to
Section 2.09(d) and Section 9.07; _provided_ that in no event shall the
Adjusted Purchase Price be more than Sellers calculation of the Purchase
Price set forth in the Notice of Disagreement or less than Purchasers
calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in the Post-Closing Statement. 

Section 2.10 _Additional Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof until the Closing Date, in the event that a CMS
Sanction is imposed on Seller that individually or in the aggregate with any
and all other CMS Sanctions imposed on Seller between the date hereof and the
Closing Date has a material adverse effect on Sellers ability to provide the
services under the Administrative Services Agreement, Seller shall
provide prompt written notice to Purchaser of such CMS Sanction along with a
reasonably detailed explanation of the impact that the CMS Sanction will have
on Sellers ability to provide the services under the Administrative Services
Agreement ("Sellers CMS Sanction Notice").

(b) During the 30 calendar days after the delivery of Sellers CMS Sanction
Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to reach agreement on the Damages that the CMS Sanction
will have on Purchasers performance and operation of the Conveyed Medicare
Advantage Contracts after the Closing (it being understood and agreed that,
among other things, the impact (and the reasonably expected impact) of any
remediation or other offsetting actions that Seller or any of its Affiliates
undertakes or has taken shall be taken into account in determining the
Damages that the CMS Sanction will have on Purchasers performance and
operation of the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts after the Closing;
_provided, however_ , that in the event Seller and/or any of its Affiliates
has determined to undertake any remediation or other offsetting actions
pursuant to this Section 2.10(b), then Seller shall covenant and agree in
writing to Purchaser to promptly perform or cause to be performed such
actions; and _provided, further_ , that in no event shall such Damages be
deemed to be greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price for purposes of this
Section 2.10) (such Damages, the "Purchasers Damages"). Purchaser shall,
within such 30-calendar day period, deliver written notice to Seller,
specifying Purchasers reasonable good faith determination of the Purchasers
Damages (the "Purchasers Notice") along with reasonable detail supporting
such determination. If Purchaser timely delivers the Purchasers Notice within
such 30-day period and Seller disagrees with Purchasers determination of the
Purchasers Damages, Seller may,

 



-20-  within 10 calendar days after receiving the Purchasers Notice, deliver a
notice (the "Sellers Response Notice") to Purchaser, which notice shall
describe the nature of such disagreement in reasonable detail, specifying
Sellers reasonable good faith determination of the Purchasers Damages and
identifying any specific item(s) of dispute.

 

(c) If the greater of the two calculations of the Purchasers Damages set
forth in each of the Purchasers Notice and the Sellers Response Notice is
less than twenty percent (20%) greater than the lesser of such two
calculations, then the Purchasers Damages shall be the average of the two
calculations of the Purchasers Damages set forth in the Purchasers Notice
and the Sellers Response Notice. If the greater of the two calculations of
the Purchasers Damages set forth in the Purchasers Notice and the Sellers
Response Notice is equal to or more than twenty percent (20%) greater than
the lesser of such two calculations, then either party may thereafter upon
notice to the other party cause a Neutral Arbitrator to promptly review this
Agreement and the disputed matters for purposes of determining
the Purchasers Damages.

(d) If the parties submit the dispute to the Neutral Arbitrator, then in
making its calculation of the Purchasers Damages, the Neutral Arbitrator
shall (i) be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including the terms of this
Section 2.10, (ii) consider only the disputed matters, and (iii) determine the
value of the Purchasers Damages by choosing either the calculation of
Purchasers Damages set forth on the Purchasers Notice or the calculation of
Purchasers Damages set forth on the Sellers Response Notice. The Neutral
Arbitrators determination of the Purchasers Damages shall be based solely
on written materials, presentations and arguments submitted and/or made by
Purchaser and Seller (i.e., shall not be based on an independent review). The
Neutral Arbitrator shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a written report setting forth its determination of the
Purchasers Damages. Such Neutral Arbitrators report shall be final and
binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement. The
fees and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be paid by the party whose
calculation of the Purchasers Damages that the Arbitrator did not choose.

 

(e) The parties agree that the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount of any Purchasers Damages as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.10(c) and Section 2.10(d), but not below zero. Further, in the event
that final determination of the Purchasers Damages is not made until a date
following the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall
promptly (and in any event not more than 30 days after the date of final
determination made in accordance with Section 2.10(c) or Section 2.10(d))
deliver the amount of the Purchasers Damages to Purchaser by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by
Purchaser. Purchaser may also elect in writing to offset the amount of any
Purchasers Damages as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.10(c)
and Section 2.10(d) in whole or in part against any amounts payable by
Purchaser under the Administrative Services Agreement.

Section 2.11 _Allocation of Purchase Price._

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.09, Section 2.10 and Section 2.12) is finally determined, but
not later than 45 days thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the "Allocation Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under

 



-21-  Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code. If, within 10 days after the delivery of the
Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that Purchaser
objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Purchaser and
Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resolve such dispute
within 20 days. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve
such dispute within 20 days, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly retain an
independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing
(other than any such firm that audited the financial statements of Purchaser
or Seller or any Affiliate of either within the three calendar years before
such retention) reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller to determine
the appropriate allocation of the disputed items. Upon allocation of the
disputed items by such independent accounting firm, the allocation reflected
on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted accordingly, and such adjusted
Allocation Statement shall be the Allocation Statement for all purposes of
this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the independent accounting
firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees, except as required by a Final
Determination, to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement for Tax purposes
and (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation,
filing and audit of any Tax Return (including filing Form 8594 with its
federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing
Date).

(c) Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall deliver to
the other party a copy of its Form 8594.

 

Section 2.12 _Reduction in Applicable Service Area_. (a) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Humana Acquisition
Litigation is finally and non-appealably resolved (including by settlement)
prior to the Closing, or is resolved and such resolution has not yet been
appealed prior to the Closing, and Seller is required pursuant to or
in connection with such resolution (whether by DOJ, the U.S. District Court
overseeing the Humana Acquisition Litigation (the "Overseeing Court") or
otherwise) (such resolution, the "Final Resolution") to divest to Purchaser
individual Medicare Advantage plan Contracts covering fewer states and/or
counties than are included in the Applicable Service Area as of the date
hereof (the "Original Service Area") in order to consummate the
Humana Acquisition, then Seller shall have the option (the "Applicable
Service Area Reduction Option"), in Sellers sole discretion, exercisable by
written notice to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, to amend Sections
1.01(a)(iv) and 1.01(a)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to remove
certain states and/or counties in which Seller is not required to make
divestitures from the Applicable Service Area (such amended Applicable Service
Area, the "Final Service Area") in accordance with the following:

(i) Seller shall have the right to remove any and all counties and/or states
in which Seller is not required to make divestitures pursuant to the Final
Resolution so long as the total number of all Applicable Seller Enrollees
together with any "Applicable Seller Enrollees" as defined in the Humana
APA (collectively, the "Required Divestiture Enrollees") is at least one
hundred seventy five thousand (175,000).

 



-22- (ii) In the event that the total number of Required Divestiture Enrollees is
less than one hundred seventy five thousand (175,000), then the Final Service
Area shall include the Divested Service Area and additional counties from the
Original Service Area (collectively, the "Additional Service Area") as
follows: 

(A) Section 2.12(a)(ii) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules sets forth the
states within the Original Service Area sequentially arranged in order of
Purchasers priority (the "Preferred Service Area List");

(B) beginning with the first state on the Preferred Service Area List, if the
Divested Service Area includes any county within such state, then starting
from the largest such county, each county that is (i) closest (and thereafter,
next closest) in proximity to such county within such state and (ii) included
in the Original Service Area, shall be included in the Final Service Area
until the total number of Required Divestiture Enrollees, together with the
total number of all Additional Seller Enrollees and any "Additional Seller
Enrollees" as defined in the Humana APA (collectively, the "Aggregate
Enrollees"), is at least one hundred seventy five thousand (175,000);

 

(C) in the event the Aggregate Enrollees do not equal at least one hundred
seventy five thousand (175,000) following the process set forth in Section
2.12(a)(ii)(B) above, such process shall be repeated for each state in which
any county is included in the Divested Service Area and counties within such
state in the priority set forth on the Preferred Service Area List until the
total number of Aggregate Enrollees is at least one hundred seventy five
thousand (175,000);

(D) in the event the Aggregate Enrollees do not equal at least one hundred
seventy five thousand (175,000) following the process set forth in Section
2.12(a)(ii)(C) above, such process shall be repeated with respect to any
states and counties within such states that are included in the Original
Service Area but which are not included in the Divested Services Area in the
priority set forth on the Preferred Service Area List and otherwise as
reasonably agreed by the parties until the total number of
Aggregate Enrollees is at least one hundred seventy five thousand (175,000);
and

(E) thereafter, Seller shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to
remove any remaining counties and/or states from the Final Service Area.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller Enrollees covered by the Applicable
RPPO Contract shall be included in the Aggregate Enrollees for purposes of
meeting the threshold required in Section 2.12(a)(ii). Additionally, if Seller
exercises the Applicable Service Area Reduction Option, from and after the
exercise thereof, among other consequences

 



-23-  hereunder, the Applicable Service Area shall be limited to the smaller
number of states and/or counties on Sections 1.01(a)(iv) and 1.01(a)(v) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules as amended pursuant to the Applicable Service
Area Reduction Option, the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts shall be
limited to individual Medicare Advantage plan Contracts covering such smaller
number of states and/or counties and the Seller Enrollees and Purchaser
Enrollees shall be limited to natural persons who reside in such smaller
number of states and/or counties, in each case for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the determination of the scope of the Purchased Assets
and the amount of the Purchase Price hereunder.

(c) If Seller exercises the Applicable Service Area Reduction Option, and the
Final Service Area includes any Additional Service Area pursuant to Section
2.12(a)(ii), then, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use best
efforts to consummate the closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities with respect to the
Divested Service Area hereunder as promptly as practicable, without delay due
to the inclusion of the Additional Service Area in the Final Service Area
pursuant to Section 2.12(a)(ii) (including, if necessary or advisable, by
means of an initial closing with respect to the Divested Service Area
hereunder and a subsequent closing with respect to the Additional Service Area
hereunder). 

(d) If Seller is required pursuant to or in connection with the Final
Resolution to divest individual Medicare Advantage plan Contracts covering
states and/or counties outside of the Original Service Area, and Purchaser
agrees in writing to purchase such Contracts, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that natural persons who reside (as defined by applicable Law) in such
states and/or counties and are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan offered
by Seller or any of its Affiliates directly to individuals in such state
and/or counties pursuant to any such Contract shall count towards the
threshold required in Section 2.12(a)(ii), as if such persons were "Aggregate
Enrollees" hereunder, and the impact of counting such persons in such manner
on the operation of Section 2.12(a)(ii) shall be as reasonably agreed by the
parties.

 

Section 2.13 _Regional PPO_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to Purchaser for
any reason at any time prior to the Closing, not to sell to Purchaser pursuant
hereto the Applicable RPPO Contract (or any portion thereof, including on a
county-by-county basis), and if Seller exercises such option, the Applicable
RPPO Contract (or the applicable portion(s) thereof) shall cease to be a
"Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contract" for all purposes of this Agreement.

no other party has repudiated any provision of the NDAs.

Medicare Advantage Contract Novations or any Required Purchaser Permit in
favor of Purchaser.

Section 4.08 _Financing_ _._ _ _

(a) Purchaser has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources
of immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby,

 



-34-  including paying in full all amounts required to be paid hereunder by
Purchaser, including with respect to any regulatory capital requirements
arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets.
Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder,
including its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
are not subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of financing.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser has delivered to Seller a
complete and correct copy of a fully executed commitment letter from Barclays
Bank PLC (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes to such letter as and
to the extent delivered to Seller on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which Barclays Bank PLC has
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide the debt financing described therein in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Debt Commitment Letter and any other
debt commitment letter (including any replacement of the Debt Commitment
Letter in connection with any Alternative Financing) executed in accordance
with Section 5.05, as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived in
accordance with Section 5.05, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes
to such letters, are hereinafter referred to together as the "Debt Commitment
Letters." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters
is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt Financing".

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser
and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, Barclays Bank PLC, and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms against Purchaser and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, Barclays Bank PLC (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions). All commitment fees required to be paid under the Debt Commitment
Letter have been paid in full or will be duly paid in full as and when due;
and Purchaser shall have otherwise satisfied all of the conditions required
to be satisfied by Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter
has not been amended, modified or terminated on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, no such amendment, modification or termination is
contemplated by Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement, and no Debt
Commitment Letter will be amended, modified or terminated by Purchaser, in
violation of Section 5.05. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by Purchaser under the Debt Commitment Letter.
Purchaser, as of the date of this Agreement, is not aware of any fact,
occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate (assuming the accuracy of
Sellers representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement) in any
material respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause the
commitments provided in the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated or
ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. The
consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent
other than those expressly set forth in the copy of the Debt Commitment
Letter, and there are no contingencies that would permit Barclays Bank PLC to
reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing other than those expressly set
forth in the copy of the Debt Commitment Letter. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies of which,
removing only fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and certain other items
(none of which concern or would adversely affect the amounts, availability,
timing or conditionality of the Debt Financing), but including all fee amounts
payable in connection with a termination of this Agreement, have been 

 



-35-  provided to Seller on or prior to the date of this Agreement) have been
provided to Seller on or prior to the date of this Agreement), there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts, or arrangements related to the
funding of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming no breach by
Purchaser of its representations and warranties under this Agreement (and
cooperation and assistance by Seller as required by the terms of this
Agreement) and no breach or default by Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement (in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.01
or Section 6.02 would fail to be satisfied), and based upon facts and events
known by Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or the Debt Financing will not be consummated as contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, if required to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations
under Section 5.03, and including to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and satisfy regulatory capital requirements applicable to Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates related to or arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets). The aggregate
proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with cash or cash equivalents held by
Purchaser, as of the Closing Date, will be sufficient to enable Purchaser to
pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by it in cash in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of all amounts
required to be paid pursuant to Article 2, and to pay all related fees and
expenses payable by Purchaser and satisfy all regulatory capital requirements
applicable to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates related to or arising out of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Purchased Assets.

 

Section 4.09 _No Finders  Fee_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., whose fee
will be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates who might be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. A copy of Barclays Capital
Inc.s financial services advisory agreement with Purchaser as in effect on
the date hereof has been made available to Sellers counsel on the date
hereof.

 

Section 4.10 _No Other Purchaser Representations and Warranties_. (a) Except
for the representations and warranties made by Purchaser in this Article 4,
neither Purchaser nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective businesses or any other matter furnished
or provided to Seller or made available to Seller in any "data rooms",
"virtual data rooms", management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser and its Affiliates disclaim any other
representations or warranties, whether made by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives.

 



-36- (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by Seller in Article 3 (as qualified by the applicable items
disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedules in accordance with Section 9.04
and the introduction to Article 3), neither Seller nor any other Person is
making or has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at
law or in equity, with respect to or on behalf of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, the Existing Medicare Advantage Contracts, the 2017 Seller
Medicare Advantage Contracts, the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts,
Sellers or any of its Affiliates respective other businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, future
operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans
or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Seller or any of its Affiliates or
any other matter furnished or provided to Purchaser or made available to
Purchaser in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations
or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser specifically disclaims
that it is relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or
warranties that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledges and agrees
that Seller and its Affiliates have specifically disclaimed and do hereby
specifically disclaim any such other representations and warranties.

portion of the Applicable Service Area and pursuant to one or more of the
Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts.

 

Section 5.03 _Best Efforts; Novation_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions

all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable Filings, (ii)
obtaining as promptly as practicable and maintaining all Consents required to

§ 422.550(b). Following such advance notice to CMS, Seller and Purchaser
shall timely submit all materials requested or required by CMS and cooperate
in submission of a request for CMS to approve and consent to a novation
process whereby each Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contract would be split
from the applicable Existing Medicare Advantage Contract or the applicable
2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Contract, as applicable, and transferred from
Seller and its Affiliates to Purchaser (or directly entered into by Purchaser
with CMS, as applicable), effective as of the Closing (such approval by CMS
of either the split and transfer of each Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contract
to Purchaser or Purchaser entering into each Conveyed Medicare Advantage
Contract directly with CMS, collectively, the "Medicare Advantage Contract
Novations"), which materials shall be provided as promptly as practicable and
shall include all of the information required pursuant to Chapter 12 of the
Medicare Managed Care Manual and any additional information required pursuant
to applicable Law, as may be requested by CMS, or as is advisable to effect
the Medicare Advantage Contract Novations, effective as of the Closing.
Subject to applicable Law, each party shall furnish (subject to the terms set
forth in Section 5.10(c)), to the other party such information and assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation
of the filing or submission of such request, and keep the other party
reasonably apprised of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for
additional information from, CMS or any other Governmental Authority.
Additionally, each party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other
party at least one (1) Business Days advance written notice of the time and
subject matter of any material meetings or material communications with CMS
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the other party shall,
to the extent practicable and permitted by CMS, have the right to attend and
participate in any such material meetings or material conversations.
Additionally, each party shall be entitled to receive any materials prepared
by and/or made available to the other party in connection with such meetings
or conversations and to learn of the content of such communications (subject
to limitations reasonably necessary to preserve attorney-client privilege;
_provided, however_ , that in the event either party shall invoke such
privilege and such privilege would be preserved through a joint defense
agreement entered into between Purchaser and Seller or any of its Affiliates,
then Seller and Purchaser shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement (or similar
agreement)) (it being understood and agreed that the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.03(b) and Section 5.03(c) shall be Sellers only obligations
with respect to keeping Purchaser apprised of matters relating to the Humana

 



-39-  Acquisition Litigation). Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use their best efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practical,
effective as of the Closing, the Medicare Advantage Contract Novations and to
satisfy all other requirements applicable to the Medicare Advantage Contract
Novations pursuant to 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.550-552.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, Seller shall be entitled to
control and direct the defense of the transactions contemplated hereby before
DOJ and in the Humana Acquisition Litigation and to take the lead in the
scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with, and the
conducting of negotiations with, DOJ or the Overseeing Court with respect to
such transactions, including in connection with the Humana Acquisition
Litigation; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall consult with Purchaser and
shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all significant developments,
meetings and/or communications with respect to its dealings with DOJ and in
the Humana Acquisition Litigation relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby (subject to limitations reasonably necessary to preserve attorney-
client privilege; _provided, however_ , that in the event Seller shall invoke
such privilege and such privilege would be preserved through a joint defense
agreement entered into between Purchaser and Seller or any of its Affiliates,
then Seller and Purchaser shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement (or similar
agreement)).

(d) Without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise), acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license) any business, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, association or other business organization or division or
part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, or enter into any
new line of business (any such transaction, a "Proposed Transaction"), if
doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent
of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided,_ _however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.03(d) shall
prohibit Purchaser from engaging in a Proposed Transaction that
exclusively involves Medicaid assets or if the targets health insurance or
health plan business is solely a Medicaid business so long as such Proposed
Transaction would not cause Purchaser to be in breach of any of its
representations and warranties hereunder (in each case, as if made at the
time of such Proposed Transaction, rather than as of the date of this
Agreement).

(e) In addition, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts, as reasonably requested by Seller and at
Sellers cost and expense in the case of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection
therewith, to cooperate with Seller, Humana and their respective Affiliates in
connection with their efforts to defend the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement in the Humana Acquisition Litigation,
including participating in

 



-40-  meetings with DOJ and the Overseeing Court, and sharing with Seller or its
legal counsel, as appropriate, documents, data and other information that
Seller or its legal counsel may reasonably request related to any products or
services that are the subject of the Humana Acquisition Litigation.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each party
acknowledges and agrees that nothing herein shall obligate, or be construed to
obligate, Seller or any of its Affiliates to, or to agree to, (i) sell,
divest, hold separate, discontinue, limit or otherwise dispose of any
property or assets of such Person or any of its Affiliates, (ii) defend
against any Action challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) agree to any conditions (including in any consent decree)
relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the current or future operations
or ownership of such Person or any of its Affiliates or (iv) take any other
action to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(d).

 

Section 5.04 _Enrollee Non-Solicitation_ _._ During the Restricted Period,
Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, and shall
not instruct its Brokers to, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce or
attempt to persuade any Purchaser Enrollee to enroll in any individual
Medicare Advantage plan of Seller or any of its Affiliates in the
Applicable Service Area; _provided_ that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.04 shall not prohibit (a) general advertisements or similar
solicitations not specifically targeted to Purchaser Enrollees, including
Brokers general marketing activities in the ordinary course of business, or
(b) any enrollment or other activities with respect to any Purchaser Enrollees
who respond to any such general advertisements, general marketing or similar
solicitation. From the Closing Date through the later of (A) December 31,
2018 and (B) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,
use any Aetna and/or Coventry brand or substantially similar brand, name or
logo for any Medicare Advantage plan of Seller or any of its Affiliates
offered directly to individuals in the Applicable Service Area, with
the exception of such use in connection with (1) any Medicare Advantage or
other plan offered by Seller or any of its Affiliates to groups or to any
individual who is part of a group, (2) any Special Needs Plan, (3) pursuant to
the Administrative Services Agreement, (4) any Medicare Supplement plan,
standalone prescription drug plan or any other plan that is not a Medicare
Advantage plan offered pursuant to a Contract or (5) any Medicare Advantage or
other plan offered outside of the Applicable Service Area (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict in any way the
use by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any Humana brand or substantially
similar brand, name or logo, including for any Medicare Advantage plan
offered directly to individuals in the Applicable Service Area).

Section 5.05 _Financing Covenants_ _._ (a) If required to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section
5.03, and including to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
satisfy regulatory capital requirements applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets), (i) Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, take, or to cause to be taken, all such actions as
may be necessary to arrange the Debt Financing on substantially the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including (A) to negotiate
and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) by the
Closing Date, and (B) to satisfy or 

 



-41-  obtain the waiver of, on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing and to comply with all of Purchasers obligations pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements related thereto; (ii) in
the event that all conditions to funding the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, Purchaser shall cause the Financing
Source to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, pay related fees and expenses and satisfy all
regulatory capital requirements applicable to Purchaser related to or arising
out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
Purchased Assets, in each case on the Closing Date (including by taking
enforcement action to cause the Financing Source to provide the Debt
Financing); and (iii) Purchaser shall not release or consent to the
termination of the commitments and obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter nor shall Purchaser terminate the Debt Commitment Letter.
Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related thereto of
which Purchaser has become aware or any termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter or such definitive agreements. In the event that the Debt Financing is
required for Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
(including its obligations under Section 5.03, and including to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and satisfy regulatory capital requirements
applicable to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates related to or arising out of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the Purchased
Assets), and any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Purchaser
shall (A) obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, alternative debt financing for any such portion from alternative
debt sources ("Alternative Financing") in an amount that will still enable
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
satisfy regulatory capital requirements applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets, and (B) promptly notify Seller of
such unavailability and the reason therefor. If obtained, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller true and complete copies of all agreements (including
redacted copies of engagement and fee letters, removing only fee amounts,
market "flex" provisions and certain other terms (none of which concern or
would adversely affect the amounts, availability, timing or conditionality of
the Debt Financing), but including all fee amounts payable in connection with
a termination of this Agreement) pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Purchaser with Alternative Financing.
Purchaser shall not, without Sellers prior written consent, permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related thereto unless
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related
thereto, in each case as so amended, modified or waived, are substantially
similar to those in the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
related thereto, prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver (other than economic terms, which shall be as good as or better for
Purchaser than those in the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
relating thereto prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver); _provided_ that in the case of amendments, modifications or waivers
of the Debt Commitment Letter or a definitive agreement relating thereto, the
foregoing shall only apply if such amendment, modification or waiver (x) would
reasonably be expected to (i) adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Purchaser timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or satisfying regulatory capital requirements applicable to Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates related to or arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Purchased Assets 

 



-42-  or (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or the satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur, (y)
reduces the amount of the Debt Financing or (z) adversely affects the ability
of Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating thereto. Purchaser
shall provide Seller with prompt written notice of the receipt of any notice
or other communication from the Financing Source with respect to the Financing
Sources failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement in connection therewith. Upon
Sellers written request, Purchaser shall provide Seller with the status of
Purchasers efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall have the
right to substitute the net cash proceeds received by Purchaser after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date from consummated offerings or other
incurrences of long-term non-callable debt (including notes) with a maturity
date on or after December 31, 2021 by Purchaser for all or any portion of the
Debt Financing by reducing commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ that (i) to the extent any such debt has a special or mandatory
redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, (ii) such offering or other
incurrence of debt does not result in a breach or default under, or violation
of, the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing committed under the Debt Commitment Letter following such reduction,
together with other cash and cash equivalents available to Purchaser, is
sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy regulatory capital
requirements applicable to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates related to or
arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the Purchased Assets and (iv) Purchaser promptly notifies Seller of such
substitution and reduction.

(b) Seller shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to use, Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cooperate, on a timely basis, with Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing ( _provided_ that any cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries), including (i)
providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more confidential
information memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda and other customary marketing and syndication materials reasonably
requested by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Debt
Financing; (ii) reasonably cooperating with the Financing Source
or prospective financing sources (including lenders, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents) for the Debt Financing (together with the
arrangers and the partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors,
attorneys, officers, employees, advisors, accountants, consultants, agents,
Affiliates and Representatives and successors of any of the foregoing) and
their respective agents due diligence, including providing access to
documentation reasonably requested by any such Person in connection with the
Debt Financing; and (iii) assisting in preparing customary rating agency
presentations and causing appropriate members of Sellers management to
participate in a reasonable number of sessions with rating agencies
in connection with the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required (A) to prepare, create or
provide (unless previously prepared and available) any financial information
or financial statements in respect of Seller, any of its Affiliates or the
Purchased Assets in connection with any Debt Financing or (B) to take any
action that would subject it to actual or potential Liability, to bear any
cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment (other than reasonable out-of-

 



-43-  pocket costs and expenses) or incur any other Liability or provide or agree
to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the
foregoing. Purchaser shall, (1) promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Seller in connection with
the assistance of Seller contemplated by this Section 5.05(b) and (2)
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, reasonable attorneys fees, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement provided such settlement has been
entered into with Purchasers written consent (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with any financing or
other securities offering of Purchaser or any assistance or activities

available to the public other than by breach of this Agreement by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives, (b) to the extent that disclosure of
such information is required by applicable Law or by the rules, instruction

after Purchaser, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances,
has been provided with reasonable notice and opportunity to take action
against any such disclosure), (c) in connection with the prosecution or
defense of any claim or potential claim made or proposed to be made in
connection with this Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby or (d) in

shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide CMS with such certifications
concerning the discharge of such obligation as may reasonably be requested by
CMS.

 

Section 5.09 _Preauthorizations_. Purchaser hereby agrees that it shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, honor and abide by, and not rescind, revoke or
modify, any preauthorization of coverage or services given in good faith in
the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing by Seller to any Seller
Enrollee that becomes a Purchaser Enrollee. Seller acknowledges and agrees
that any denial of a prior authorization request that occurred prior to the
Closing Date, which after the Closing Date is reasonably determined to be
improperly denied, shall be an Excluded Liability with respect to that portion
of the claim relating to periods from and after the Closing Date through the
date of the determination that such denial of prior authorization request was
improperly denied.

 

Section 5.10 _Access to Information_. (a) From the date hereof until the
Closing, Seller shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and subject
to the Confidentiality Agreements, (i) give, and cause its Affiliates to give,
Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access to the books and records
of Seller and its Affiliates relating to the Existing Medicare Advantage
Plans and, if the Closing occurs after January 1, 2017, relating to the 2017
Seller Medicare Advantage Plans, in each case to the extent relevant to the
Applicable Service Area and (ii) furnish, and cause its Affiliates to
furnish, to Purchaser and its Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information that is in Sellers and its Affiliates possession
and in the format maintained by Seller or its applicable Affiliate relating to
the Existing Medicare Advantage Plans and, if the Closing occurs after
January 1, 2017, relating to the 2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Plans, in each
case as such Persons may reasonably request. From the date hereof until the
Closing, without Sellers prior written consent, Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, contact any Enrollees, other than in the
ordinary course of Purchasers or its Affiliates businesses, so long as any
such contact does not relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and is in any event conducted in compliance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

(b) For the Required Period, (i) each party shall maintain and (subject to
customary confidentiality agreements and subject to
applicable confidentiality Laws) make available to the other party on a
reasonable basis, for inspection and duplication by it and its Representatives
books and records in such partys or its Affiliates possession that solely
relate to the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts or such partys
operations related to the Purchased Assets either before or after the Closing,
to the extent that such access is required (A) in connection with any Action,
investigation, compliance with Law purpose or matters relating to or affected
by the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts or such partys operations
related to the Purchased Assets either before or after the Closing, including
the preparation of financial reports, or (B) to conclude, evidence and

maintain such books and records at its own cost), and (ii) neither party shall
dispose of, alter or

 



-46-  destroy any such books or records for the Required Period; _provided_ that
neither party shall be required to maintain or make available to the other
party for any purpose, nor shall either party have any other obligation
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.10(b) with respect to,
any policies, procedures or other proprietary materials of such party or any
of its Affiliates. After the Required Period, each party may destroy or
otherwise dispose of any such corporate and accounting records, files,
documents and correspondence, unless prior to the expiration of the Required
Period the other party has given notice of its desire for a
reasonable opportunity to either take possession of such information or to
make copies thereof at the requesting partys cost (subject to applicable
confidentiality Laws). The "Required Period" shall mean (1) for patient,
and patient-related, information, 10 years following the Closing Date, and
(2) for any other information or materials, seven years following the Closing
Date, _provided_ that if a longer period is required by applicable Law, then
the Required Period shall be such period required by applicable Law.

(c) Each party shall only be required to grant access to the other party

normal business hours in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of such party and its Affiliates and upon at least
five Business Days advance written notice to such party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall require (i) Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to (A) provide
information or documents that (1) are competitively sensitive, (2) are not in
such partys or its Affiliates possession, (3) include (x) any rebate or
discount agreement or other contract relating to the provision of
pharmaceutical coverage or products that are applicable to any Existing
Medicare Advantage Contract, 2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Contract or
Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contract or any Excluded Assets or (y) any broker
or vendor agreements or compensation information related to unassigned
Provider, Broker or vendor contracts or rates or (4) otherwise do not relate
to the Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts, (B) convert information or
documents into a different format than the format in which such information
or documents are held by such party and its Affiliates, or (C) provide the
other party or its Representatives with access to (1) personnel records of any
employee of such party or any of its Affiliates relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information
which, in the disclosing partys good faith opinion, is sensitive or the
disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to subject such party or any
of its Affiliates to material risk of Liability, (2) information the
disclosure of which, in the disclosing partys good faith opinion (x) would
conflict with confidentiality obligations to which such party or any of its
Affiliates is bound or (y) would reasonably be expected to result in the
forfeiture or waiver of any attorney-client or similar privilege; _provided_
that, in the case of this clause (y), the disclosing party shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide the other party, to the extent
possible, with access to the relevant information in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture or waiver of any such
attorney-client or similar privilege or (ii) either partys independent
accountants to make available to the other party or its Representatives any
work papers unless and until such Person has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants.

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, subject to
Section 5.10(c), Seller shall make available to Purchasers Representatives in
the electronic data

 



-47-  room established by Seller that is known to Purchaser and Seller as the
"clean room" and pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreements each of the
Material Provider Contracts with Material Providers that have received
payments from Seller in excess of $100,000 during the period from January 1,
2015 through May 31, 2016 that was not made available to Purchaser on or prior
to the date hereof.

 

Section 5.11 _Broker Matters_. If, in order for Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to pay Assumed Commissions (as defined in the form of
Administrative Services Agreement attached hereto as _Schedule A_ ) to any
Broker that enrolled individuals in an Existing Medicare Advantage Plan or a
2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Plan prior to the Closing, Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates is required under applicable Law to appoint such Broker as
its agent for such purpose, then:

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with such information with respect to such Broker as is necessary to
permit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to appoint such Broker in such
capacity;

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, appoint such Broker in such capacity and train such Broker to the extent
required by CMS; and

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Seller with written evidence of
such appointment and training, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller.

Section 5.12 _2017 Calendar Year True-Ups_. (a) If the Closing occurs after
January 1, 2017, and the 2017 Split Year Medicare Advantage Contracts are the
Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts, the parties shall take the actions
provided for by Section 5.12(b) so as to ensure that:

 

(i) with respect to 2017 Enrollee-Based Payments, each party receives the
aggregate amount of 2017 Enrollee-Based Payments (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, no greater or lesser amount of 2017 Enrollee-Based Payments) that
should have been paid to such party in accordance with CMS requirements and
other applicable Law for calendar year 2017 coverage of Enrollees under the
2017 Seller Split Year Medicare Advantage Plans, in the case of Seller, or the
Purchaser Medicare Advantage Plans, in the case of Purchaser (the aggregate
amount of 2017 Enrollee-Based Payments that should have been paid to each
party, such partys "2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement"); and

(ii) with respect to any 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment, each party bears a
portion of such 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment equal to (A) the aggregate amount
of such 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment, multiplied by (B) a fraction, (1) the
numerator of which is the sum of the number of Enrollees during each month of
calendar year 2017 in which such party offered the Medicare Advantage plan
under which such 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment arises, and (2) the denominator of
which is the sum of the number of Enrollees during each month of
calendar year 2017; _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 5.12, the
number of Enrollees during any month of calendar year 2017 shall be as set
forth in the most current membership roster for such month issued by CMS
relating to Enrollees, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be based,
in whole or in part, on any

 



-48-  other information including any records of Seller, Purchaser or any other
Person, including CMS (the portion of any 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment that each
party bears hereunder, such partys "2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion").

(b) If the Closing occurs after January 1, 2017, and the 2017 Split
Year Medicare Advantage Contracts are the Conveyed Medicare Advantage
Contracts:

(i) As promptly as practicable after Purchasers receipt of each CMS Report
and in no event more than 30 Business Days thereafter (which period Seller
shall agree to reasonably extend upon written request by Purchaser reasonably
documenting the reason for such extension and the period of such extension
may not exceed an additional 30 calendar days), Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller (A) a written statement (the "Purchaser True-Up Statement") setting
forth Purchasers calculation of (1) each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment
Entitlement and/or each partys 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as
applicable, relating to such CMS Report, and (2) the net amount payable by
either Purchaser or Seller to the other party as a result of such calculation
so as to ensure that each party receives or bears its 2017 Enrollee-Based
Payment Entitlement and/or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable,
relating to such CMS Report, taking into account, in the case of each partys
2017 Enrollee-Based Entitlement, the aggregate amount of 2017 Enrollee-Based
Payments that such party actually received for calendar year 2017, including
any adjustment to or additional payment actually received with respect to any
such payment for calendar year 2017 (such net amount, the "True-Up Amount"
relating to such CMS Report), and (B) a copy of each applicable CMS Report.

 

(ii) If Purchaser fails to timely deliver any Purchaser True-Up Statement in
accordance with Section 5.12(b)(i), Purchaser shall still be required to
deliver to Seller the applicable CMS Report(s) in accordance with Section
5.12(b)(i), and if any CMS Report is not so delivered, Purchaser hereby
authorizes Seller to request such report directly from CMS and authorizes CMS
to deliver such report directly to Seller. In such event: (A) upon receipt of
any CMS Report from Purchaser or CMS, as applicable, Seller shall be entitled
to calculate each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement and/or 2017
Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable, relating to such CMS Report(s);
and (B) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (1) a written statement (the "Seller
True-Up Statement") setting forth Sellers calculation of (x) each partys
2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement and/or each partys 2017 Plan-Based
Adjustment Portion, as applicable, and (y) the True-Up Amount, in each case
relating to such CMS Report(s), and (2) a copy of each applicable CMS Report.
Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with the True-Up Amount and all other
items and amounts in each Seller True-Up Statement, and each such item and
amount shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all purposes
of this Agreement.

(iii) If Purchaser timely delivers a Purchaser True-Up Statement and the
applicable CMS Report(s) in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(i), and Seller
disagrees with Purchasers calculation of either partys 2017 Enrollee-Based
Payment Entitlement or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable,
relating to such CMS Report(s) as set forth in such Purchaser True-Up
Statement, Seller may, within 30 Business Days after receipt of such Purchaser
True-Up Statement, deliver a notice (a "Notice of True-Up

  



-49-  Disagreement") to Purchaser disagreeing with either partys 2017 Enrollee-
Based Payment Entitlement and/or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as
applicable, as set forth in such Purchaser True-Up Statement, and specifying
Sellers calculation of (A) each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment
Entitlement and/or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable, and (B)
the True-Up Amount, in each case relating to such CMS Report(s). If Seller
does not timely deliver a Notice of True-Up Disagreement following receipt of
a Purchaser True-Up Statement, (1) Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with
the True-Up Amount and all other items and amounts contained in such
Purchaser True-Up Statement; and (2) each such item and amount shall be final
and binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(iv) If Seller timely delivers a Notice of True-Up Disagreement with respect
to a Purchaser True-Up Statement, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30
Business Days after delivery of such notice, use their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to reach agreement on the disputed matters in order to
determine (A) each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement and/or
2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable, relating to the applicable
CMS Report(s), each of which amounts shall not be greater than the greatest
value for such amount claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such amount claimed by either party, in each case as set forth in the
applicable Purchaser True-Up Statement or the applicable Notice of True-Up
Disagreement, as applicable, and (B) the True-Up Amount relating to the
applicable CMS Report(s). If Purchaser and Seller reach agreement as to the
True-Up Amount relating to any CMS Report during such 30 Business Day period,
such True-Up Amount and each other item and amount relating to the calculation
thereof that is agreed upon by the parties in connection with their agreement
as to such True-Up Amount shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(v) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement as to either partys
2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment
Portion, as applicable, relating to a CMS Report during such 30 Business Day
period, either party may thereafter cause an independent accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and
Seller (the "Accounting Referee"), to promptly review this Agreement and the
disputed matters for the purpose of calculating each partys 2017 Enrollee-
Based Payment Entitlement and/or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion,
as applicable, relating to such CMS Report. If the parties submit the dispute
to an Accounting Referee, then in making such calculation, the Accounting
Referee shall (A) be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including the
definitions of 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment, 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment
Entitlement, 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment, 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment Portion,
True-Up Amount and the other terms of this Section 5.12, (B) consider only the
disputed matters and (C) not assign a value to any disputed item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as set
forth in the applicable Purchaser True-Up Statement or the applicable Notice
of True-Up Disagreement, as applicable. The Accounting Referees determination
of any disputed matter shall be based solely on written materials,
presentations and arguments submitted and/or made by Purchaser and Seller
(i.e., shall not be based on an independent review). The Accounting Referee
shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as practicable,

 



-50-  a written report setting forth (1) its calculation of the disputed matters
and each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement and/or 2017 Plan-
Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable, relating to such CMS Report, each of
which amounts shall not be greater than the greatest value for such amount
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such amount
claimed by either party, in each case as set forth in the applicable
Purchaser True-Up Statement or the applicable Notice of True-Up Disagreement,
as applicable, and (2) the True-Up Amount relating to such CMS Report. Such
Accounting Referees report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser
and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee for each report shall be allocated between Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the aggregate dollar value of the items set forth in the
Notice of True-Up Disagreement not awarded to Purchaser and Seller bears to
the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Seller claims
that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount
determined by Purchaser and if the Accounting Referee ultimately resolves such
items by awarding to Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs
and expenses of the Accounting Referee will be allocated thirty percent (30%)
(i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Purchaser and seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000)
to Seller.

 

(vi) Within five Business Days after the True-Up Amount relating to any CMS
Report has become final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller pursuant to
Section 5.12(b)(ii), Section 5.12(b)(iii), Section 5.12(b)(iv) or Section
5.12(b)(v), as applicable, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall pay to
the other party such True-Up Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified by the receiving party.

(vii) Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that it shall, and agrees at its
expense to cause its independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the
calculation of each partys 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment Entitlement and 2017
Plan-Based Adjustment Portion, as applicable, relating to any CMS Report, and
in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 5.12(b), including
making available, to the extent reasonably requested, books, records, work
papers and personnel in accordance with Section 5.10(c).

 

(viii) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) each party acknowledges and agrees that
amounts received under any Conveyed Medicare Advantage Contracts or the 2017
Seller Medicare Advantage Contracts may fall within the scope of this Section
5.12 if and to the extent that such amounts constitute 2017 Enrollee-Based
Payments or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustments, and any such amounts shall be
allocated between the parties in accordance with this Section 5.12
notwithstanding the fact that such amounts also constitute Purchased Assets or
Excluded Assets, and (B) each party acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of
itself and each of its Respective Indemnified Persons) that neither party nor
any of its Respective Indemnified Persons shall have any right or remedy
against the other party or any of its Respective Indemnified Persons for any
matter or claim relating to any report or other communication issued by CMS
after December 31, 2018, regardless of whether such report or other
communication contains a determination by CMS of (1) any adjustment to or
additional payment with respect to any 2017 Enrollee-Based Payments or (2)
any 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment.

 



-51- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser and
Seller agree that, in connection with any calculation used as the basis for
any 2017 Enrollee-Based Payment or 2017 Plan-Based Adjustment, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, perform
such calculation in good faith and consistent with their respective practices
used for such calculations for their other similar businesses.

Section 5.13 _Mail and Communications_. Each party shall promptly deliver to
the other party any mail or other communications relating to the Purchased
Assets that is intended for the other party and that is received by such party
or any of its Affiliates following the Closing.

Section 5.14 _Notices of Certain Events_. (a) Each of Purchaser and Seller
shall promptly notify the other party of any of the following if such party
has knowledge thereof: (i) any written notice or other written communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) any written or
material oral notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii)
the commencement of any Action or investigation that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.06, in the case of Seller, or Section 4.05, in the case of
Purchaser.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a partys good faith
failure to comply with this Section 5.14 shall not provide the other party
the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except, in each case, to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement
independently provides such right.

 

Section 5.15 _Seller Marks_. From and after the Closing, except as otherwise
set forth in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement, Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (a) use or reference any
trademarks, service marks, domain names, logos or names owned by Seller or any
of its Affiliates (including the AETNA and/or COVENTRY name or marks) or any
mark confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the "Seller Marks"), (b) hold
themselves out as having any affiliation, either expressly or by implication,
with Seller or any of its Affiliates or (c) challenge the ownership, validity
or enforceability of any of the Seller Marks.

Section 5.16 _Tax Matters_. (a) Purchaser and Seller agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.10(c), upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets (including access to
books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Purchaser and Seller shall retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Assets for
a period of at least six years following the Closing Date. On or after the end
of such period, each party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
provide the other party with at least 10 days prior written notice before
destroying any such books and records, during which period the party receiving
such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books
and records. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Purchased Assets.

 



-52- (b) Any real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar _ad valorem_
obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period
which includes (but does not begin on) the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser
based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period in the Post-
Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser
shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

-54- Section 5.19 _Exclusivity_. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier

inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to (including by way of furnishing information or

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause any such party in possession of

other relief which may be available, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damages, posting bond or providing surety, and without regard to the

Purchased Assets, and (z) it has terminated all discussions with third parties
(other than any Governmental Authorities) with respect to such proposed
matters.

 

Section 5.20 _Purchase Option_. (a) In consideration of the transactions
contemplated hereby, if after the date hereof Seller or any of its Affiliates
are required to, or otherwise determine to, divest individual Medicare
Advantage plan Contracts in addition to the Conveyed Medicare Advantage
Contracts (the portion of such Contracts covering the applicable geographies
to be divested, the "Additional Contracts") in connection with the Humana
Acquisition and prior to the closing of the Humana Acquisition, Purchaser
shall have the exclusive irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase, free
and clear of any Liens except Permitted Liens, the Additional Contracts on
terms substantially identical to those set forth in this Agreement at a
purchase price calculated on a per-Enrollee basis of the amount per Enrollee
set forth on Section 5.20(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, to be
adjusted proportionally based on deviation in premium revenue and medical
benefit ratio for such Additional Contracts as compared to the Conveyed
Medicare Advantage Contracts and such other metrics as the parties shall
mutually agree upon. Seller shall provide prompt notice in writing to
Purchaser of its intention to divest such Additional Contracts and Purchaser
shall have the right to irrevocably exercise the Option with respect to all
(but not less than all) of the Additional Contracts within 15 days of receipt
of such notice by providing irrevocable written notice of such election to

 



-55-  Seller; _provided, however_ , that if Purchaser shall notify Seller in
writing within such 15-day period that it is diligently and in good faith
pursuing financing sources to enable it to exercise the Option, then
Purchaser shall have up to a total (including the initial 15 days) of 30 days
to provide such notice of election to Seller (such 15-day or 30-day period,
the "Option Exercise Period"). Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it will
exercise the Option and acquire the Additional Contracts if, in Purchasers
good faith and reasonable judgment, (i) the acquisition of the Additional
Contracts pursuant to this Section 5.20, and (ii) the acquisition of the
Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement, considered together and as a
whole, are commercially reasonable. If Purchaser exercises the Option during
the Option Exercise Period (including any extension of the Option
Exercise Period pursuant to Section 5.20(b) below), Purchaser and Seller will
enter into an amendment to this Agreement or an agreement on substantially
similar terms as this Agreement promptly after such exercise providing for
Purchasers purchase of the Additional Contracts. If Purchaser does not
exercise the Option within the Option Exercise Period (including any extension
of the Option Exercise Period pursuant to Section 5.20(b) below), Seller shall
be free to sell, divest or otherwise transfer the Additional Contracts to one
or more Persons without restriction thereafter and this Option shall
thereafter terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that all
of Purchasers rights under this Section 5.20 (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the grant of the Option to Purchaser) shall terminate on the earlier
to occur of (1) the closing of the Humana Acquisition and (2) the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.20(a), if Seller
reasonably and in good faith determines that Purchasers purchase of the
Additional Contracts pursuant to the Option is not reasonably likely to be
consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement, including Section 5.20, taking into account, among other things,
any governmental or other Consent requirements for (or potential governmental
challenges to) such purchase and the likelihood that such Consents will be
obtained (or such challenges overcome) in a timely manner, Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such determination, which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail Sellers concerns underlying such
determination, and Purchaser shall have 10 days after receipt of such notice
to reasonably respond to the issues raised by Seller. If after such 10-day
period, Purchaser is unable to reasonably address Sellers concerns as
determined in Sellers reasonable good faith judgment, then Seller shall not
be required to offer the Additional Contracts to Purchaser pursuant to the
Option, and Purchaser shall not have the right to purchase the Additional
Contracts pursuant to the Option. Alternatively, if during such 10-day period,
Purchaser is able to reasonably address Sellers concerns as determined in
Sellers reasonable good faith judgment, then the Option Exercise Period shall
be extended for such additional period of time (up to 10 days) for Purchaser
and Seller to resolve any issues raised by Seller under this Section 5.20(b).

Section 5.21 _Humana Purchase Agreement_. Without Sellers prior written
consent, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend,
waive, alter or otherwise modify the Humana APA.

Section 5.22 _2018 Bids_. (a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
subject to applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide Purchaser with copies of all business and financial books, records and
data maintained by or on behalf of Seller and its 

 



-56-  Affiliates that are required to prepare each of the bids to be submitted to
CMS with respect to the entry into any Contract split from and replacing any
2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Contract pursuant to which any Medicare
Advantage plans will be offered directly to individuals in the Applicable
Service Area during calendar year 2018 (each, a "2018 Bid", and such books,
records and data, collectively, the "2018 Bid Information"); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i) with respect to any 2018 Bid Information relating to any county in the
Applicable Service Area in which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates offers or
is planning to offer Medicare Advantage plans directly to individuals, such
2018 Bid Information shall not be provided to Purchaser and shall instead be
provided to a third-party consultant designated by Purchaser, subject to the
prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned (such consultant, the "Reviewing Consultant"), and the Reviewing
Consultant may not share any 2018 Bid Information or any notes, summaries,
analyses or compilations derived, in whole or in part, from any 2018 Bid
Information, with Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives prior to the Closing;

(ii) with respect to any 2018 Bid Information provided to Purchaser,
Purchaser shall ensure that such 2018 Bid Information is provided or otherwise
accessible only to those of Purchasers and its Affiliates employees who are
responsible for preparing Purchasers and its Affiliates 2018 Bids, and such
employees may not share any 2018 Bid Information or any notes, summaries,
analyses or compilations derived, in whole or in part, from any 2018 Bid
Information, with any other employees or other Representatives of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing;

(iii) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
Section 5.10(c)(i)(A)(3), the 2018 Bid Information shall include business and
financial books, records and data maintained by or on behalf of Seller and its
Affiliates of the types referred to in Section 5.10(c)(i)(A)(3) (in either
aggregated or, if required, unaggregated), to the extent that such books,
records and data are required to prepare the 2018 Bids (the books, records and
data referred to in this clause (iii), collectively, "Sensitive 2018 Bid
Information"); and

 

(iv) Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the 2018 Bid
Information to Purchaser or the Reviewing Consultant, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 5.22(a) promptly after the 2018 Bid Information becomes
available to Sellers and its Affiliates own employees who are responsible
for preparing Sellers and its Affiliates 2018 Bids. 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
(including, if applicable, the Reviewing Consultant) to, (i) keep the 2018
Bid Information confidential, (ii) use the 2018 Bid Information solely for the
purpose of preparing the 2018 Bids and (iii) return or destroy (A) the
Sensitive 2018 Bid Information, including any notes, summaries, analyses and
compilations derived, in whole or in part, from the Sensitive 2018 Bid
Information, promptly after the earlier of (1) the submission of the 2018 Bids
to CMS, regardless of whether Seller and its Affiliates, or Purchaser and its
Affiliates, submit their respective 2018

 



-57-  Bids to CMS pursuant to Section 5.22(c), and (2) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) all other 2018 Bid Information,
including any notes, summaries, analyses and compilations derived, in whole
or in part, from such 2018 Bid Information, promptly after any request by
Seller to do so following the earlier of (1) the submission of Sellers and
its Affiliates 2018 Bids to CMS, if Seller and its Affiliates submit the
2018 Bids pursuant to Section 5.22(c), and (2) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Purchaser shall be liable to Seller
for any breach of Sections 5.22(a) or 5.22(b) by any of its Affiliates
or Representatives (including, if applicable the Reviewing Consultant).

(c) Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall prepare their own respective 2018 Bids.
If the Closing occurs after June 1, 2017, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, submit their respective 2018 Bids to CMS when due. If the
Closing occurs on or before June 1, 2017, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, submit their respective 2018 Bids to CMS when due.

 

(d) Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare their
respective 2018 Bids in good faith and in compliance with applicable Laws.
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare their respective 2018
Bids in the ordinary course of business consistent with Sellers and its
Affiliates practices for the preparation of bids with respect to the
entry into Contracts pursuant to which Medicare Advantage plans will be
offered directly to individuals outside of the Applicable Service Area for
calendar year 2018, and Seller shall cause its and its Affiliates respective
2018 Bids to be for individual Medicare Advantage plans for calendar year
2018 that in each case have a plan design that is capable of being supported
by Purchasers and its Affiliates existing systems and vendor agreements.
Unless Purchaser shall have terminated the Administrative Services Agreement
in accordance with its terms with respect to calendar year 2018 prior to the
submission of the 2018 Bids to CMS, Purchaser shall cause its and its
Affiliates respective 2018 Bids to be for individual Medicare Advantage
plans for calendar year 2018 that in each case have a plan design that is
capable of being supported by Sellers and its Affiliates existing systems
and vendor agreements. Seller shall ensure that none of its or its
Affiliates 2018 Bids are prepared by employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates who are responsible for preparing Humanas individual Medicare
Advantage bids.

Section 7.04 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_ _._ (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a) (the "Indemnified Party")
agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is
to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any Action by any third party (a "Third-Party

 



-63-  Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of
such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification in respect thereof,
including the specific Section or Sections hereof that the Indemnified Party
claims to have been breached (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party) and the Section or Sections hereof
pursuant to which the Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Following delivery of the initial notice
with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all written notices and other
documents (including any court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to such Third-
Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.04(b), shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of the
Indemnifying Partys choice for such defense, in each case at the Indemnifying
Partys own expense, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Party within 30 days after receipt of the initial notice with
respect to such Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 7.04(a); _provided_ that, if such Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises out of any criminal enforcement action against the Indemnified Party
or seeks as its primary remedy equitable or injunctive relief against the
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control the
defense of such Third-Party Claim and appoint lead counsel of the Indemnified
Partys choice for such defense (so long as such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), in each case at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, if the Indemnified Party gives notice of its intention to do
so to the Indemnifying Party within 30 days after the Indemnified Party
becomes aware that either of the above circumstances exists with respect to
such Third-Party Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.04, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim, if the settlement (1) does not release the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-
Party Claim or (2) imposes injunctive or other equitable relief on the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates that limits the operation of the
business of any of such Persons and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and to employ
separate counsel of its choice and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party
shall not settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, and shall furnish or cause
to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



-64- Section 7.05 _Direct Claim Procedures_ _._ If an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnity under Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a) against the Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the
Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice thereof in writing to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances of such Direct Claim and the basis for indemnification
in respect thereof, including the specific Section or Sections hereof that the
Indemnified Party claims to have been breached (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party) and the Section or
Sections hereof pursuant to which the Indemnified Party claims to be entitled
to indemnification hereunder. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 7.06 _Calculation of Damages_ _._ (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as applicable, by the Indemnifying
Party shall be decreased by any (i) amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) Tax benefit actually realized by
the Indemnified Party (in cash or as a reduction in Taxes otherwise due)
arising from the incurrence or payment of such Damages. If the Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from
any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, after the
Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment in respect of such
Damages, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days) reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 7.02(a) or
7.03(a), as applicable, for any Damages relating to any matter to the extent
that the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates has recovered for such
Damages under another provision of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents.

 

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use its respective Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate in accordance with applicable Law any Damages for which
such Indemnified Party may seek indemnification under this Agreement;
_provided_ that any Damages incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection
with efforts to mitigate any Damages pursuant to this Section 7.06 shall
constitute Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party for which such
Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article 7.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
collect any amounts available under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible, for or with respect to any Damages
payable by the Indemnifying Party under Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as
applicable.

Section 7.07 _Assignment of Claims_ _._ If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as

 



-65-  applicable, and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party based on the underlying claim asserted by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
hereby assigns such of its rights to proceed against such third party as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such third party
the amount of such payment; _provided_ that such assignment would not
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the business,
affairs, customer, Enrollee, Provider or supplier relationships or prospects
of the business of such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnifying Partys right to seek coverage from any subrogation with respect
to insurance carriers shall not be subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

Section 7.08 _Exclusive Remedy_ _._ From and after the Closing, except (a) as
expressly provided in Section 2.09 (Purchase Price Adjustment), Section 2.10
(Additional Adjustment to Purchase Price), Section 5.12 (2017 Calendar Year
True-Ups), Section 5.16 (Tax Matters) or the other Transaction Documents or
(b) with respect to (i) actual and intentional fraud by either party with
respect to its representations and warranties expressly contained herein, and
(ii) equitable relief pursuant to Section 9.12, each party acknowledges and
agrees (in the case of Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Persons, and in the case of Seller, on behalf of itself
and each of the other Seller Indemnified Persons (in each case, such partys
"Respective Indemnified Persons")) that the sole and exclusive remedy of such
party and its Respective Indemnified Persons against the other party or its
Respective Indemnified Persons for any matter or claim relating to the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, the
Existing Medicare Advantage Plans, the 2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Plans,
Purchasers Medicare Advantage Plans, the Existing Medicare Advantage
Contracts, the 2017 Seller Medicare Advantage Contracts, this Agreement, the
subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
claim for breach of contract and misrepresentation or breach of warranty under
this Agreement) shall be as provided by this Article 7.

 

Section 7.09 _Purchase Price Adjustment_ _._ To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, any amount paid under this Article 7 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price paid hereunder.

Section 7.10 _Additional Indemnity Provisions_ _._ The indemnification
rights of the parties hereunder shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of representation or warranty
resulting in a claim for indemnification hereunder (but not for purposes of
determining the amount of Damages), each representation and warranty contained
in this Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to
any "materiality" or "material adverse effect" standard or qualification
contained in such representation or warranty (as if such standard or
qualification was deleted from such representation and warranty).

 

(b) Each party acknowledges that any rights to indemnification of the other
party or its Respective Indemnified Persons for breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the first such
party contained in this Agreement, and the rights and

 



-66-  remedies that may be exercised by the other party hereunder, are part of the
basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement, and neither partys
rights to indemnification under this Agreement shall be limited, waived or
otherwise affected by virtue of (and each party shall be deemed to have relied
on the express representations and warranties of the other party set forth in
this Agreement notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of such party or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives, of any inaccuracy of any such
representation or warranty of the other party set forth in this Agreement,
regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained through such partys
own investigation or otherwise (including disclosure by the other party or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives), and regardless of whether such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

satisfied;

 

(f) by Seller if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this

failure to perform (i) is incapable of being cured or (ii) has not been cured
by Purchaser within 45 days following written notice to Purchaser from Seller

(g) by Seller if Seller, Humana or any of their respective Affiliates shall
have received notice from any Governmental Authority that such Governmental

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement an acceptable remedy) or (iii)
the Humana Acquisition Litigation shall have been finally and non-appealably
resolved (including by settlement), or shall have been resolved and such

void, and such termination shall be without Liability of either party or their
respective Affiliates (or their respective Representatives or equityholders)
to the other party, except as provided in Section 8.03(a);  _provided_ that,
subject to Section 8.03(b), if such termination shall result from the
intentional failure of either party to (a) fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or (b) perform any
covenant or agreement of such party contained herein, such intentionally
failing party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages or other Liability
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure. The
provisions of this Section 8.02, Section 8.03, the last sentence of Section

terminated on or prior to December 31, 2016 (A) by Seller pursuant to Section
8.01(b), Section 8.01(d), Section 8.01(g) or Section 8.01(h) (in each case,
other than in the event that the circumstances giving rise to such right to
termination were proximately caused by Purchasers material breach of this
Agreement) or (B) by either party under Section 8.01(c)(i) as a result of an
Order relating to the Humana Acquisition Litigation (other than in the event
that the circumstances giving rise to such right to termination were
proximately caused by Purchasers material breach of this Agreement) or
Section 8.01(j) (but only if termination pursuant to this provision is in
connection with termination of the Humana APA as a result of an Applicable
Termination (as defined thereunder)) (each of the terminations described in
clauses (A) and (B) above, an "Applicable Termination"), then Seller shall pay
or cause to be paid to Purchaser a fee in the amount of (1) the Applicable
Portion of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), plus (2) the Applicable
Portion of Purchasers Transaction Costs; (ii) if this Agreement is terminated
on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to July 1, 2017 pursuant to an

Purchaser a fee in the amount of (1) the Applicable Portion of Seventy-Five
Million Dollars ($75,000,000), plus (2) the Applicable Portion of Purchasers
Transaction Costs; and (iii) if this Agreement is terminated on or after July
1, 2017 pursuant to an Applicable Termination, then Seller shall pay or cause
to be paid to Purchaser a fee in the amount of (1) the Applicable Portion of
One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), plus (2) the Applicable Portion
of Purchasers Transaction Costs (the amount referred to in the foregoing
clause (i), (ii) or (iii), as applicable, the "Applicable Termination Fee") as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five
Business Days following such termination) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser.

(b) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall Seller be
required to pay or cause to be paid the Applicable Termination Fee on more
than one occasion, and in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to receive an
amount greater than the Applicable Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if
Purchaser receives the Applicable Termination Fee from Seller pursuant to this
Section 8.03, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Purchaser and its Respective

 



-69-  Indemnified Persons against Seller and its Respective Indemnified Persons
and their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders,
managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and none of Seller
or its Respective Indemnified Persons shall have any further Liability
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) if Purchaser or any of its Respective Indemnified Persons
receives any payments from Seller or any of its Respective Indemnified Persons
in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Purchaser receives
the Applicable Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.03, the amount of
the Applicable Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of
such payments made by Seller and its Respective Indemnified Persons in respect
of any such breach. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.03 do
not constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if Seller fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03, Seller shall also pay any reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses) incurred by Purchaser in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment for such amount against Seller failing to promptly pay such amount.
Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this Section 8.03 shall bear interest
from the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_  in
effect on the date of such payment.

Section 9.08 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT 

 



-72-  IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH
SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT THE OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (d) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 9.08.

 

Section 9.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_ _._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by e-mail with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by electronic communication,
facsimile or otherwise) by the other party. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement
between the parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to the
subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties and their respective Affiliates
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either party. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable harm would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law (a) for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement
or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that, except where this Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, and each party
further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of 

 



-73-  any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further agree that (i)
by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.12, a party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 8.02,
monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.12 are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this
Section 9.12 shall require any party to institute any Action for (or limit any
partys right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this
Section 9.12 before exercising any termination right under Section 8.01 (and
pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any
Action pursuant to this Section 9.12 or anything contained in this Section
9.12 restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.01 or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any
rights or claims against the Financing Source or its Representatives (which
for the avoidance of doubt shall exclude Purchaser and its Affiliates)
in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter (whether in
law, equity, tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made by a Financing Source in connection
herewith or therewith and Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees
not to commence any action or proceeding against the Financing Source or its
Representatives (which for the avoidance of doubt shall exclude Purchaser and
its Affiliates) in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
acknowledged and agreed that neither the Financing Source nor its
Representatives shall have any liability for any claims or damages to Seller
in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
