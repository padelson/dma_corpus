5.3 _Notice of Title Defects_. Buyer shall give Sellers written notice of all
Title Defects discovered by Buyer promptly upon discovery by delivering to
Sellers a written " _Notice of Title Defects_ " setting forth such Title
Defects. Buyer shall notify Sellers weekly of all Title Defects discovered by
Buyer through the date of such notice and not previously noticed to Sellers.
The Notice of Title Defects shall (i) describe the Title Defect, (ii) describe
the basis of the Title Defect, (iii) include copies of any title opinion,
title memoranda and other documentation supporting the basis of the Title
Defect, (iv) describe in general terms the curative action that Buyer
reasonably anticipates would need to be taken in order to cure such Title
Defect, and (v) describe Buyer's good faith estimate of the reduction in the
Allocated Property's Allocated Value caused by the Title Defect, taking into
consideration the nature of the Title Defect and the likelihood that such
Title Defect may actually result in a claim against or loss of title (" _Title
Defect Value_ ") (provided that the Title Defect Value, together with the
aggregate Title Defect Values attributable to any other Title Defects
affecting such Allocated Property, shall not exceed the lesser of the
Allocated Property's Allocated Value or the cost to cure the Title Defect, if
the cost to cure is reasonably determinable) and associated calculations and
documentation (for clarity, if a Title Defect affects a Well and affects a
Lease, the Title Defect Value shall be determined separately with respect to
the Well and the Lease and aggregated to determine the Title Defect Value of
the Title Defect). The final Notice of Title Defects shall be delivered on or
before the Defect Notice Deadline. Buyer will be deemed to have conclusively
waived (A) any Title Defect about which it fails to notify Sellers in writing
prior to the Defect Notice Deadline and (B) any Title Defect with respect to
which the Title Defect Value is less than the Title Defect Threshold.

  

  

    

5.4 _Defect Adjustments and Deductibles; Interest Additions_. Sellers shall
proceed as follows with respect to an asserted Title Defect:

  

  

a. Sellers shall have the option until two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date to cure any Title Defect affecting any Allocated Property that is timely
identified under Section 5.3.

  

  

b. If a Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer affecting an Allocated Property
is not cured or waived on or before two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement, on or
before Closing, on the existence of the Title Defect and the Title Defect
Value, and, if they reach agreement, such Title Defect Value shall be included
in determining the Title Defect Adjustment, if any, under Section 5.4(c). In
the event that Buyer and Sellers do not reach such an agreement by Closing,
the subject Allocated Property shall be excluded from the Assets to be
conveyed at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the excluded Allocated Property (a " _Title Defect Exclusion_ ") and
such Allocated Value shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by Buyer at
Closing pursuant to Section 5.4(e).

  

  

c. The " _Title Defect Adjustment_ " shall be the amount, if any, by which (i)
the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Values with respect to uncured and
unwaived Title Defects affecting Allocated Properties that are not Title
Defect Exclusions, less the aggregate amount of the value of all individual
Interest Additions, exceeds (ii) the Title Defect Deductible Amount. The
Purchase Price shall be reduced pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iii), in accordance
with Sellers election under Section 5.4(e), by the Title Defect Exclusions and
the Title Defect Adjustment.

  

  

d. If Buyer or Sellers discover any additional interests in an Allocated
Property that are not listed in _Exhibit A_ or _B_ , including any interest
that entitles Sellers to receive more than the NRI set forth in _Exhibit A_ or
_B_ , or obligates Sellers to bear costs and expenses in an amount less than
the WI set forth in _Exhibit A_ or _B_ (without a corresponding decrease in
the NRI, and except as such NRIs may be increased, or such WIs may be
decreased, from time to time under non-consent provisions of applicable
operating agreement or state law due to participation elections made after the
date hereof under applicable operating agreements or state law) (each an
"Interest Addition"), the discovering Party shall promptly notify the other of
such Interest Additions. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the
aggregate amount of the value of all Interest Additions (less the amount
thereof, if any, netted against the Title Defect Values under Section
5.4(c)(i)). The Party who discovers Interest Additions shall give the other
Party written notice of the Interest Additions as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the Defect Notice Deadline. This notice shall be in writing
and shall include (i) a description of each Interest Addition, (ii) the basis
for each Interest Addition, and supporting title opinions, title memoranda and
other documentation with respect thereto, (iii) the Allocated Value of the
Allocated Property affected by the Interest Addition, and (iv) the value of
the Interest Addition or the amount by which the notifying Party believes the
Allocated Value of the Allocated Property has been increased by the Interest
Addition and the computations upon which such Party's belief is based. The
value of the Interest Addition shall be determined by the Parties in good
faith taking into account all relevant factors or, if the Parties are unable
to agree on the existence or value of any Interest Addition, each Party shall
have the right to seek judicial determination thereof subject to Section
16.11.

  

  

    

e. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 5, Sellers shall have
the right to elect, at their sole discretion, whether any Purchase Price
adjustments resulting from Title Defect Exclusions or Title Defect Adjustments
under Section 5.4(c) shall be adjustments to the Cash Consideration or the
Stock Consideration. If Sellers elect that any such adjustment will be to the
Cash Consideration, the adjustment at Closing under Section 3.2(b)(iii) shall
be made to the Cash Consideration, and the Title Defect Value under Section
5.4(b), if applicable, shall be paid into the Escrow Account in cash by wire
transfer. If Sellers elect that any such adjustment will be to the Stock
Consideration, the adjustment under Section 3.2(b)(iii) shall be to the number
of shares of Common Stock delivered at Closing as the Stock Consideration, and
Common Stock shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent under 5.4(b), if
applicable, and the Parties will amend the Escrow Agreement if necessary to
accommodate the Escrow Agent holding such stock. The number of shares of
Common Stock to be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 5.4(b)
shall be determined by the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Exclusion(s) or
Title Defect Value of the Title Defect(s), as applicable, divided by the per
share Execution Date Stock Value. Sellers election under this Section 5.4(e)
shall be set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement.

  

  

5.5 _Post-Closing Cure of Title Defects_. In the event that the Title Defect
giving rise to the exclusion of an Allocated Property from this Agreement as a
Title Defect Exclusion, or to a Purchase Price reduction for the Title Defect
Value, is cured by Sellers (provided Sellers shall have no obligation to
attempt to cure Title Defects) and Sellers deliver to Buyer pertinent
information reasonably necessary to document the curative action within 120
days after the Closing Date, provided that if Sellers are attempting to cure a
Title Defect and have initiated a quiet title, heirship, probate or other
legal proceeding to cure such Title Defect within 120 days after the Closing
Date, then such 120 day period shall be deemed extended to the date that is 10
days after a final determination or settlement of such proceeding (or if such
condition is satisfied based on a judicial determination whether such
determination occurs before or after such 120 day period), then (i) in the
case of a Title Defect associated with an Allocated Property that is not a
Title Defect Exclusion, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the
Title Defect Value or (ii) in the case of an Allocated Property that is a
Title Defect Exclusion, Sellers shall have the option to put the excluded
Allocated Property to Buyer, such put option shall be exercised by Sellers
delivering written notice to Buyer of Sellers' election to put the excluded
Allocated Property to Buyer within 120 days after the Closing Date (or, if
later, 15 days after receipt of (A) the judicial determination or (B) the
final determination or settlement of the proceeding described above), and if
such exercise notice is given, then, within 15 days after Buyer\'s receipt of
such notice, Sellers shall assign such Allocated Property to Buyer by an
assignment in the form of _Exhibit G_ and Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Allocated Property, adjusted as provided
in Section 3.2 and Section 5.6(i), provided for payments made by Buyer under
clause (i) and (ii) above, if the applicable Title Defect Adjustment or the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Exclusion, was escrowed in the
form of cash, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay such amount
in cash, and if the applicable Title Defect Adjustment or the Allocated Value
of the applicable Title Defect Exclusion, was escrowed in the form of Common
Stock, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the appropriate
number shares of Common Stock (with the number of shares of Common Stock shall
be determined using the Execution Date Stock Value).

  

  

    

5.6 _Post-Closing Determination of Title Defects_. Sellers shall have the
right to commence a judicial action, subject to Section 16.11, to dispute (x)
the validity of the Title Defects and Title Defect Values asserted by Buyer
with respect to a Title Defect Exclusion, and (y) any dispute regarding the
validity of any of Sellers' curative actions with respect to a Title Defect,
provided that such action shall be commenced, if at all, within 30 days after
the end of the 120 day period described in Section 5.5. If Sellers have not
commenced such an action within such 30 day period with respect to a Title
Defect Exclusion, or with respect to any disputed curative actions, Sellers
shall retain such Title Defect Exclusion and the disputed curative actions
shall not be given effect, as the case may be, and the Parties will instruct
the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer the cash or Common Stock, as applicable,
held in the Escrow Account with respect thereto. If Sellers commence such an
action within such 30 day period, then within 10 Business Days after a final
decision in such action:

  

  

(i) with respect to a Title Defect Exclusion, (A) Sellers may elect to
exercise their put option under Section 5.5 (provided that the put price shall
be reduced by the amount by which the Title Defect Adjustment would have been
increased at Closing had the uncured Title Defect Values affecting such Title
Defect Exclusion been included in determining the Title Defect Adjustment at
Closing using the values determined in such action), and (B) if Sellers do not
timely exercise such put option, Sellers shall retain such Title Defect
Exclusion and the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer
the cash or Common Stock, as applicable, held in the Escrow Account with
respect thereto; and

  

(ii) if a disputed Title Defect with respect to an Allocated Property assigned
to Buyer at Closing is determined (A) to have been cured, the Parties shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Sellers the cash or Common Stock, as
applicable, held in the Escrow Account with respect thereto, or (B) not to
have been cured, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Buyer the cash or Common Stock, as applicable, held in the Escrow Account with
respect thereto.

  

5.7 _Changes in Product Prices; Wells or Other Events_. There shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price for, and the following shall not affect
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement, including Buyer's obligation to
close the transactions contemplated hereby if the conditions in Section 10.2
are satisfied or waived by Buyer, and from and after Closing Buyer shall
assume all risk of loss with respect to: (i) changes in product prices and any
other market factors or conditions, (ii) production declines or any adverse
change in the production characteristics or downhole condition of a Well,
including a Well watering out, experiencing a collapse or failure in the
casing or sand infiltration, including inter-well interference or
communication, whenever occurring, (iii) any change in laws, rules or
regulations, or (iv) any ban or moratorium on drilling, fracing or other
completion methods or any legislative bill, or any ballot initiative or
referendum to amend the Colorado constitution or enact or amend a statute,
rule or regulation with respect to drilling, fracing or other completion
methods or the power of any governmental entity to ban, restrict or regulate
drilling, fracing or other completion methods.

  

  

    

5.8 _Consents_. Sellers shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain all required consents known to Sellers relating to a transfer of their
interest in the Assets. If Buyer discovers other affected Assets that are
subject to a consent to transfer requirement during the course of Buyer's Due
Diligence Review, Buyer shall notify Sellers immediately and Sellers shall use
their reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consents prior to Closing.

  

  

    

  |  

a. Required Consents. That portion of the Assets for which a consent has not
been obtained and such lack of consent would invalidate an attempted
conveyance of the Assets to Buyer (a " _Required Consent_ ") shall be excluded
from the Assets conveyed at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated Properties. Sellers
shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such Required Consent
following Closing for a period of one year and if a Required Consent is
obtained within one year after the Closing, then, within 15 days after receipt
of such consent, Sellers shall assign such excluded portion of the Assets to
Buyer using an assignment in the form of _Exhibit G_ in exchange for a payment
by wire transfer from Buyer equal to the Allocated Value of the excluded
Allocated Properties, subject to the adjustments described in Section 3.2.
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in obtaining any required
consent including providing assurances of financial condition.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

  |  

b. Non-Required Consents. The following types of consents shall not constitute
Required Consents: (I) consents to transfers of title by the BLM, the State of
Colorado or any county, (II) consents set forth in, or arising out of, a
farmout or similar agreement pursuant to which Sellers has already satisfied
all conditions for earning any interests that constitute a part of the Assets
and Sellers has received or is due an assignment of, the earned interests
under such agreement, and (III) consents which if not obtained by Closing
would not invalidate the conveyance of the Assets. For each of the consents of
the type described in Section 5.8(b)(I), Buyer, within 30 days after Closing,
shall file for approval with the applicable government agencies all federal,
state and county transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of the
Assets. Buyer further agrees promptly after Closing to take all other actions
required of it by federal, state or county agencies having jurisdiction to
obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with respect to this transaction,
and to use its best efforts to obtain the unconditional approval by such
federal, state or county agencies, as applicable, of the assignment documents
requiring federal, state or county approval in order for Buyer to be
recognized by the federal, state or county agencies as the owner of the
Assets. Buyer shall provide Sellers approved copies of the assignment
documents and other federal, state and county transfer documents as soon as
they are available.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

  

5.9 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with all preferential right to purchase
provisions relative to their interest in the Assets by sending notice of this
Agreement, within ten Business Days after execution of this Agreement, to all
Persons holding preferential rights, offering to sell to each such Person that
portion of the Assets for which such a preferential right is held for an
amount equal to the Allocated Values of the subject Allocated Properties and
subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement. If, during the
course of its Due Diligence Review, Buyer discovers any additional
preferential rights, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers. That portion of the
Assets, if any, subject to preferential purchase rights which have been
expressly waived by the holder thereof by Closing, or which are deemed waived
by the failure of the holder thereof to exercise its preferential right to
purchase within the applicable period following receipt of notice thereof
where such period expired prior to Closing, shall be included in the Assets to
be conveyed to Buyer at Closing. That portion of the Assets, if any, subject
to preferential purchase rights where the holder has exercised the
preferential right prior to Closing, or where the deadline for the holder to
elect to exercise such right is after the Closing, shall be excluded from the
Assets identified in this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Values of the excluded Allocated Properties; provided, however,
that if the holder of such preferential right is required to but fails to
consummate the purchase of such Assets on or prior to the Closing Date, then
Sellers shall notify Buyer, and Sellers shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase from Sellers, the Assets to which the preferential purchase right was
asserted for such Allocated Values. If the preferential purchase rights
covering an Asset excluded pursuant to the preceding sentence are waived or
expire without being exercised subsequent to Closing, Sellers shall give
notice thereof to Buyer and within five Business Days after receipt of such
notice, Buyer shall purchase such Asset from Sellers for the Allocated Value
thereof, subject to the adjustments described in Section 3.2, and Sellers
shall assign such Asset to Buyer using an assignment in the form of _Exhibit
G_.

  

  

5.10 _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if any material portion of an
Allocated Property is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of
an Allocated Property is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or
under the right of eminent domain (" _Casualty Loss_ ") (provided that none of
the matters covered by Section 5.7 shall constitute a Casualty Loss), such
Allocated Property shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated
Property, unless Buyer and Sellers agree upon the estimated cost to repair
such Allocated Property (with equipment of similar utility) or other
appropriate reduction to the Purchase Price, not to exceed the Allocated Value
of the Allocated Property (the Purchase Price adjustment, whether from
excluding the Allocated Property or agreement upon an appropriate adjustment,
is herein called the " _Net Casualty Loss_ ") and Sellers shall retain all
insurance proceeds and all claims against third parties with respect to the
Casualty Loss. Sellers, at their option, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss.
If Sellers elect to cure such Casualty Loss, Sellers may replace any personal
property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of similar
grade and utility, or replace any personal property with personal property of
similar nature and kind if such property is acceptable to Buyer in its
reasonable discretion. If Sellers elect to cure the Casualty Loss, and in fact
cure the Casualty Loss to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, there shall be
no adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

  

    

ARTICLE 6 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  

  

6.1 _NORM and Asbestos_. Some production equipment may contain asbestos and/or
NORM. In this regard Buyer and Sellers expressly understand that NORM may
affix or attach itself to the inside of Wells, materials and equipment as
scale or in other forms, that said Wells, materials and equipment located on
or associated with the Assets may contain NORM and that NORM containing
material may have been buried or otherwise disposed of on the Assets. Buyer
and Sellers also expressly understand that special procedures may be required
for the Remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of asbestos or NORM
from the Assets where such material may be found and that, if the Closing
occurs, Buyer assumes all liability for or in connection with the assessment,
containment, removal, Remediation, transportation and disposal of any such
materials, in accordance with all past, present or future applicable laws,
rules, regulations and other requirements of any governmental or judicial
entities having jurisdiction and also with the terms and conditions of all
applicable leases and other contracts.

  

  

6.2 _Environmental Assessment_. Upon advance notice to Sellers, to the extent
Sellers have the authority to do so, Sellers shall allow Buyer to conduct, at
Buyer's sole risk and expense, on-site inspections and an environmental
assessment and compliance audit (an " _Environmental Assessment_ ") of the
Assets. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers do not operate certain Assets and,
with respect to such Assets, promptly following Buyer's written request,
Sellers will request that the operator of the Assets allow Buyer access to the
Assets for purposes of conducting its Environmental Assessment but that the
operator may not permit such access. In connection with any on-site
inspections or Environmental Assessment, Buyer agrees not to interfere with
the normal operation of the Assets and agrees to comply with all requirements
and safety policies of the operator of which Buyer has notice. If requested by
Sellers, the Parties shall execute a "common undertaking" letter regarding the
confidentiality of Environmental Assessments where appropriate. Buyer shall
not conduct any test drilling or sampling activities without prior notice to
and consent of Sellers and the operator of the affected Asset. Buyer shall
provide Sellers prior written notice of any environmental inspections and
tests, and Buyer shall give Sellers the opportunity to participate in all such
inspections and tests. Buyer shall provide Sellers, at no cost to Sellers, all
reports of environmental inspections and tests.

  

  

IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRANTING OF SUCH ACCESS, BUYER REPRESENTS THAT IT IS
ADEQUATELY INSURED AND BUYER WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND
AND SAVE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLERS INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST,
ALL CLAIMS FOR INJURY TO, OR DEATH OF, PERSONS OR FOR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY
ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO, OR THE ACTIVITIES OF, BUYER,
ITS EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THIS
WAIVER, RELEASE AND INDEMNITY BY BUYER SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

  

6.3 _Adjustments for Environmental Defects_.

  

  

a. _Notice of Environmental Defects_. Buyer shall give Sellers written notice
of all Environmental Defects affecting the Assets which Buyer's Environmental
Assessment reveals, and will provide evidence thereof, promptly upon
discovery. Buyer shall notify Sellers weekly of all Environmental Defects, and
will provide evidence thereof, discovered by Buyer through the date of such
notice and not previously noticed to Sellers. The final notice of
Environmental Defects and evidence thereof shall be delivered on or before the
Defect Notice Deadline. Buyer will be deemed to have conclusively waived (A)
any Environmental Defect about which it fails to notify Sellers in writing
prior to the Defect Notice Deadline and (B) any Environmental Defect as to any
single incident with respect to which the Environmental Defect Value is less
than the Environmental Defect Threshold.

  

  

    

b. _Defect Adjustments_.

  

  

(i) Sellers shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure,
on or before three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any Environmental
Defect affecting the Assets that is timely identified under Section 6.3(a).

  

  

(ii) If an Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer that is not cured by
Sellers on or before two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and
Sellers shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement by Closing on the
existence of the Environmental Defect and an adjustment to the Purchase Price
which shall be reflected on the Preliminary Settlement Statement, which
adjustment shall reflect the lowest reasonable cost to Remediate such
Environmental Defect as would a prudent operator (" _Environmental Defect
Value_ "). In the event that Buyer and Sellers do not reach such an agreement
by Closing, the affected Allocated Property shall be excluded from the Assets
to be conveyed at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Allocated Property (an " _Environmental Defect
Exclusion_ ").

  

  

(iii) The " _Environmental Defect Adjustment_ " shall be the amount, if any,
by which (A) the aggregate amount of all Environmental Defect Values with
respect to un-Remediated and unwaived Environmental Defects exceeds (B) the
Environmental Defect Deductible Amount. The Purchase Price shall be reduced
pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iv) in accordance with Seller\'s election under
6.3(b)(iv) by the sum of the Environmental Defect Exclusions and the
Environmental Defect Adjustment.

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, Sellers shall have
the right to elect, at their sole discretion, whether any Purchase Price
adjustments resulting from Environmental Defect Exclusions or Environmental
Defect Adjustments under Section 6.3(b)(iii) shall be adjustments to the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration. If Sellers elect that any such
adjustment will be to the Cash Consideration, the adjustment at Closing under
Section 3.2(b)(iv) shall be made to the Cash Consideration. If Sellers elect
that any such adjustment will be to the Stock Consideration, the adjustment
under Section 3.2(b)(iv) shall be to the number of shares of Common Stock
delivered at Closing as the Stock Consideration, determined by using the
Execution Date Stock Value per share of the Common Stock. Sellers election
under this Section 6.3(b)(iv), shall be set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement.

  

  

    

6.4 " _As Is, Where Is " Purchase_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement (including the indemnification obligations of each Seller under
Article 15), Buyer shall acquire the Assets (including Assets for which a
notice was given under Section 6.3(a)) in an "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition and
shall assume all risks that the Assets may contain waste materials (whether
toxic, hazardous, extremely hazardous or otherwise) or other adverse physical
conditions, including the presence of unknown abandoned oil and gas wells,
water wells, sumps, pits, pipelines or other waste or spill sites which may
not have been revealed by Buyer's investigation. At and after the Closing, all
responsibility and liability related to all such conditions, whether known or
unknown, fixed or contingent, will be transferred from Sellers to Buyer,
regardless of when the responsibility and liability arose.

fees, associated with Buyer obtaining the requisite consents and approvals to

measures as necessary to sell the Stock Consideration under Rule 144, shall be
borne solely by Buyer.

necessary, shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a final settlement statement
(the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth each adjustment or
payment that was not finally determined as of the Closing and showing the

Purchase Price_ "). The Final Settlement Statement shall be adjusted to
reflect any Title Defects cured pursuant to Section 5.5, any adjustments for

deliver to Sellers a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes
to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyer's failure to deliver to
Sellers a written report detailing changes to the proposed Final Settlement
Statement by that date shall be deemed an acceptance by Buyer of the Final
Settlement Statement as submitted by Sellers. The Parties shall attempt in
good faith to agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, no

Section 13.2 shall be called the " _Final Settlement Date_." If the Final
Purchase Price is more than the Closing Amount plus the Deposit, Buyer shall
pay Sellers the amount of such difference pursuant to Section 3.1. If the
Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Amount plus the Deposit, Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference. Any such payment by Buyer or
Sellers shall be by wire transfer in immediately available funds within five
Business Days after the Final Settlement Date.

  

  

    

  

13.2 _Determination of Final Settlement Statement Disputes_. If the Parties
are unable to resolve any dispute concerning the Final Settlement Statement or
Final Purchase Price on or before 30 days after the Final Settlement Statement
is received by Buyer, Sellers shall have the right to seek judicial
determination of such dispute, subject to Section 16.11, provided that such
action shall be filed, if at all, within 15 days after the end of such 30 day
period and if such action is not filed within such 15 day period Sellers shall
be deemed to have accepted Buyer's changes to the Final Settlement Statement

  

  

13.3 _Records_. Buyer shall and shall cause its successors and assigns to
provide Sellers access to the Records pursuant to Section 9.1(l).

  

  

13.4 _Suspense Accounts_. Under Section 3.2(b)(vii) Buyer shall be credited

grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any
logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Sellers or any of their

contemplated by this Agreement, including Buyer's execution of separate
letters assuming specific contracts included in the Assets as may be required

ARTICLE 14 
 TAXES

  

14.1 _Apportionment of Taxes_. " _Taxes_ " means all ad valorem, property,
production, excise, net proceeds, severance, and all other taxes and similar
obligations assessed against the Assets or based upon or measured by the
ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons or the receipt of
proceeds therefrom, other than income taxes. All Taxes based on production of
hydrocarbons shall be deemed attributable to the period during which such
production occurred, and not to the period during which such Taxes are
assessed. All Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the
Effective Date for all taxable periods that include the Effective Date. The
apportionment of Taxes between the Parties, adjusted to take into account
credits for withholding amounts assigned to or applied for the benefit of
Buyer as provided below, shall take place as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Article 3.2 in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, using
estimates of such Taxes if actual numbers are not available.

  

  

14.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Each Party shall be liable for any Transfer Taxes
required to be paid by it in connection with the sale of the Assets pursuant
to this Agreement.

  

  

14.3 _Tax Reports and Returns_. Buyer will file all ad valorem tax returns
from 2014 revenues and production and Seller shall have filed all ad valorem
tax returns related to 2013 revenue and production. The Party not filing the
return agrees to provide the Party filing the return with appropriate
information which is necessary to file any required tax reports and returns
related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to pay all ad valorem taxes due after the
Effective Date. Notwithstanding the above, the rights to any amounts withheld
by third parties from previous production proceeds for the purpose of paying
then unpaid ad valorem taxes for 2013 production assessed in 2014 (payable in
2015) or for 2014 production assessed in 2015 (payable in 2016) will be
assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing. If any purchaser of production has not
withheld appropriate amounts from 2013 production proceeds for the purpose of
paying ad valorem taxes assessed for 2014 (payable in 2015), or for 2014
production assessed in 2015 (payable in 2016) then (i) the actual amount
necessary to pay the then unpaid ad valorem taxes assessed on 2013 production
(payable in 2015) and (ii) the estimated amount that should have been withheld
from 2014 production based upon pre-Effective Date production (at the rate
indicated by the most recently published mill levy) will be determined, and
such amounts will be credited to Buyer at Closing pursuant to Sections 3.2 and
14.1. The assignment of, and credit for, these amounts shall serve as a final
settlement for ad valorem taxes. To the extent that Seller receives any ad
valorem taxes withheld from post-Effective Date revenue, Seller shall promptly
pay such amounts to Buyer. For Tax periods in which the Effective Time occurs,
Sellers agree to promptly forward to Buyer copies of any tax reports and
returns received by Sellers after Closing and provide Buyer with any
information Sellers have that is necessary for Buyer to file any required tax
reports and returns related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to file all tax
returns and reports applicable to the Assets that Buyer is required to file
after the Closing and, subject to the provisions of Section 14.1, to pay all
taxes payable with respect to the Assets.

  

  

    

14.4 _Like-Kind Exchange_. If requested by any Seller, Buyer will cooperate
with such Seller to accommodate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the
Code with respect to all or any of the Assets (or any portion thereof) owned
by such Seller. Such cooperation will include, without limitation, the
execution of certain documents in connection with such like-kind exchange, but
Buyer shall not be required to assume any additional liabilities or
obligations in connection therewith. Each Seller shall have the right, without
the consent of Buyer, to assign all or any portion of its interests in the
Assets to a third party designated by such Seller for purposes of facilitating
the like-kind exchange.

whether created or existing before, on or after the Effective Time, including

OBLIGATIONS SHALL EXTEND TO AND INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO (I) THE

IS ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, GROSS, JOINT, SOLE OR CONCURRENT, (II) SELLER'S OR
BUYER'S STRICT LIABILITY, AND (III) SELLER'S OR BUYER'S LIABILITIES OR
OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.

  

  

b. _Assumed Plugging and Abandonment Obligations_. Upon Closing, Buyer hereby
assumes the following plugging and abandonment obligations related to the
Assets (" _Assumed Plugging and Abandonment Obligations_ "), regardless of
whether such obligations are attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Assets before, on or after the Effective Time:

  

  

(i) the necessary and proper plugging, replugging and abandonment of all Wells

the Assets; and

  

  

(vi) obtain and maintain all bonds, or supplemental or additional bonds, that
may be required contractually or by governmental authorities.

  

  

c. _General Assumption_. Except to the extent covered by Sellers' limited

assume and pay, perform, fulfill and discharge (i) all claims, costs,
expenses, liabilities and obligations accruing or relating to the ownership or
operation of the Assets before, on or after the Effective Time, including the

").

  

  

  

15.2 _Indemnification_. Losses arising from diminution of value of any portion
of the Assets shall in no event exceed the Allocated Value of those Allocated
Properties included in such portion of the Assets, less the net proceeds
received by Buyer therefrom.

  

  

After the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers, and each Seller (as to
itself but not as to any other Seller) shall indemnify Buyer, other as
follows:

  

  

a. _Seller 's Indemnification of Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth
below, each Seller shall indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless Buyer,
its officers, directors, members, managers, employees, representatives,
attorneys and agents (the "Buyer _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against
any and all Losses attributable to or which arise from or in connection with:

  

  

  

(i) (Certain Representations) any breach by such Seller of any of its
representations or warranties under Sections 7.1 through 7.9, inclusive;
provided that such Seller shall not have any liability for claims made under
this clause (i) after 12 months after the Closing Date;

amount equal to 2% of such Seller's Share of the Purchase Price;

  

(D) such Seller's aggregate liability for all claims made under this clause
(ii) shall be limited to and shall not exceed an amount equal to 10% of such
Seller's Share of the Purchase Price; and

  

(E) Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any claim under this
clause (ii) if, as of the Closing, Buyer has knowledge of the breach giving
rise to such claim and such breach causes Buyer's Closing condition in Section
10.2(a) not to be satisfied but Buyer nonetheless proceeds with the Closing;

  

(iii) (Royalties) any third party claims for Royalties payable by such Seller
on or attributable to production from its interests in the Assets during the

provided that no Sellers shall have any liability for claims made under this

(iv) (Property Expenses) any Property Expenses incurred by such Seller with
respect to its interests in the Assets during the period prior to the

clause (vi) after 12 months after the Closing Date; and

  

  

    

(vii) (Covenants and Agreements) any breach by such Seller of its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement; provided that such Seller shall not have any

covenant or agreement was required by this Agreement to be performed;

  

  

PROVIDED THAT EACH SELLER'S LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS UNDER THIS
SECTION 15.2(a) SHALL BE FURTHER LIMITED AS FOLLOWS:

  

(1) For purposes of determining whether indemnification is payable under
Section 15.2(a)(i) or (ii) and calculating Losses related thereto, all
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers in each Seller's representations and
warranties set forth in Article 7 shall be disregarded;

  

(2) Subject to each of the foregoing limitations that may further limit a
Seller's liability with respect to a particular claim, each Seller's liability
for claims under this Section 15.2(a), in the aggregate, shall be limited to
and shall not exceed an amount equal to 25% of such Seller's Share of the
Purchase Price (for clarity, such 25% limit shall not enlarge the 10% limit in
Section 15.2(a)(ii)(D) with respect to claims made under Section 15.2(a)(ii));
and

  

(3) Other than claims under Section 15.2(a) for breach of Section 7.9, this
Section 15.2(a) shall not cover or apply to any matter regarding taxes, which
shall be handled solely as provided in Section 13.1 and Article 14.

  

b. _Buyer 's Indemnification of Sellers_. Buyer assumes all risk, liability,
obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend, indemnify, and
save and hold harmless Sellers, their respective officers, directors,
shareholders, members, managers, partners, employees, representatives,
attorneys and agents (the " _Sellers Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against
any and all Losses attributable to or which arise from or in connection with
(i) the Assumed Liabilities (including the Assumed Environmental Liabilities
and Assumed Plugging and Abandonment Obligations), (ii) any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this
Agreement, and (iii) any matter for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify
Sellers under this Agreement. The indemnification obligations of Buyer shall
survive the Closing without any time limitation.

  

  

c. Scope. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON'S SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT.

  

  

    

d. Waiver of Consequential Damages. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
AND LOSS OF PROFITS RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT AND LOSSES
INCURRED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PARTY CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE INDEMNIFYING A
THIRD PARTY.

  

  

15.3 _Procedure_. The indemnification obligations contained in Section 15.2
shall be implemented as follows:

  

  

a. _Coverage_. Such indemnity shall extend to all Losses suffered or incurred
by the indemnified Party.

  

  

b. _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall submit a written " _Claim
Notice_ " to the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") which, to be
effective, must state: (i) the amount of each payment claimed by an
Indemnified Party to be owing, (ii) the basis for such claim, with supporting
documentation, and (iii) a list identifying to the extent reasonably possible
each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within
10 days after the later of (x) receipt of the Claim Notice and (y) the date
that the amount of such payment has been finally established.

  

  

c. _Notification of Claims_. Within 20 days after the Indemnified Party
receives notice of a claim or legal action that may result in a Loss for which
indemnification may be sought under this Article 15 ("Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall
furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other
information with respect to such Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying
Party made within 60 days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the
extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of
all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can
result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party for which it is
entitled to be indemnified hereunder without its consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of a
claim or legal action, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party
thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable
information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party
shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or
other matter. In the absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will
use its reasonable efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, any
claim, legal action or other matter to which such other Party's
indemnification under this Article 15 applies until the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, and, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such
defense within the time period provided above, settle the same in the
Indemnified Party's reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party's expense.
If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so
as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Party's position with
respect to such Claim.

  

  

    

15.4 _No Insurance; Subrogation_. To the extent of the indemnification
obligations in this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers hereby waive for themselves,
their successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which each of them is respectively liable or
against which each respectively indemnifies the other, and, if required by
applicable policies, Buyer and Sellers shall obtain waiver of such subrogation
from their respective insurers.

  

  

15.5 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Sellers may have against any
Person not a party to this Agreement for any obligations or liabilities that
may be incurred with respect to the Assets.

  

  

15.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect
to the Assets shall be pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement.
Without limitation of the foregoing, if the Closing occurs the sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer for any and all: (a) claims relating to any
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered at Closing, (b) other claims
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, and (c) other claims
relating to the Assets and the purchase and sale thereof, shall be any right
to the limited indemnification from such claims that is expressly provided in
this Article 15, and if no such right of indemnification is expressly
provided, then such claims are hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted
by law. If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall also be deemed to have waived, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any right to contribution
against Sellers (including any contribution claim arising under any applicable
Environmental Law) and any and all other rights, claims and causes of action
it may have against Sellers arising under or based on any federal, state or
local statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or common law or otherwise.

  

  

15.7 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Other than Sellers' and Buyer's right to
enforce specific performance under Section 11.2(a)(ii) and 11.2(b)(i),
respectively, Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that the payment of money (as
limited by Section 15.2(a) and the other provisions of this Agreement) shall
be adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection
with or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As
the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer and Sellers waive
any right to rescind this Agreement, the sale of the Assets to Buyer, or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

15.8 _Mutual Releases_. Buyer shall be deemed to have released the Sellers
Indemnified Parties, at Closing, from any and all Losses for which Buyer has
agreed to indemnify the Sellers Indemnified Parties hereunder, and Sellers
shall be deemed to have released the Buyer Indemnified Parties, at Closing,
from any and all Losses for which Sellers have agreed to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereunder (to the extent of the dollar or time limitations
on such indemnity).

  

  

    

15.9 _Anti-Indemnity Statute Limitation_. Notwithstanding the other provisions
of this Agreement, to the extent, if at all, that Colo. Rev. Stat. §
13-21-111.5 (as amended from time to time or any successor statute) is
applicable, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed or applied to
require any Indemnifying Party to indemnify any Indemnified Party against loss
or liability for damages for (i) death or bodily injury to persons, (ii)
injury to property or (iii) any other loss, damage or expense arising under
(i) or (ii) from the sole or concurrent negligence of such Indemnified Party
or its agents or employees, the sole or concurrent negligence of an
independent contractor who is directly responsible to such Indemnified Party,
or any accident that occurs in operations carried on at the direction or under
the supervision of such Indemnified Party or an employee or representative of
such Indemnified Party or in accordance with methods and means specified by
such Indemnified Party or employees or representatives of such Indemnified
Party.

 _Schedule 9.1(p)_

  


 

  

Financial Statement Information Indemnification and Contribution

  


 

  

A. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers Indemnified Parties
from any and all Losses, whether joint or several, arising from any Claim to
which any Sellers Indemnified Party may become subject or liable or which may
be incurred by or assessed against any Seller Indemnified Party under any
statute, common law, contract or otherwise, relating to or arising out of any
of: (a) any actions or omissions of the Sellers relating to the providing of
the financial information under Section 9.1(p) (b) the completeness or
accuracy of any of the financial information under Section 9.1(p) (c) any
securities, tax, corporate, or other filings of the Buyer; or (d) Buyer's use
of the financial information under Section 9.1(p). Promptly after receipt by
the Sellers Indemnified Parties of notice of the occurrence of a Claim, or any
claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding in respect of which
indemnity may be sought against the Buyer, Sellers Indemnified Party will
notify Buyer in writing of the commencement thereof or of such Claim, and
Buyer shall immediately assume the full defense thereof (including the
employment of counsel satisfactory to the Sellers Indemnified Parties and the
payment of the fees and expenses of such counsel). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the Sellers Indemnified Parties will be entitled to employ
their own counsel in such circumstance if the Sellers Indemnified Parties are
advised in a written opinion of counsel that a conflict of interest exists
which makes representation by counsel chosen by the Buyer not advisable. In
such event, the reasonable fees and disbursements of such separate counsel
will be paid by the Buyer.

  


 

  

B. If for any reason (other than as specifically provided herein) the
foregoing indemnity for a Claim is unavailable to Sellers Indemnified Parties
or insufficient to fully hold any Sellers Indemnified Party harmless, then the
Buyer shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Sellers
Indemnified Parties as a result of such Claim in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received (including the proceeds
of any offering) by and fault of Buyer on the one hand, and the relative
benefits received by and fault of the Sellers Indemnified Parties on the other
hand, as well as any relevant equitable considerations. It is hereby further
agreed that the relative fault of the Buyer on the one hand and Sellers
Indemnified Parties on the other hand with respect to the financial
information under Section 9.1(p) shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or incorrect opinion or conclusion or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact related to the information supplied by the Buyer on the
one hand or by the Sellers Indemnified Parties on the other hand, as well as
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement, opinion, conclusion or omission. No
Sellers Indemnified Party shall have any liability to the Buyer or any other
person in connection with the financial information under Section 9.1(p)
except for any liability for losses, claims, damages or liabilities finally
judicially determined to have resulted solely and exclusively from actions
taken or omitted to be taken as a direct result of such Sellers Indemnified
Party's willful misconduct. The indemnity, contribution and expense
reimbursement agreements and obligations set forth herein shall be in addition
to any other rights, remedies or indemnification which Sellers Indemnified
Parties may have or be entitled to at common law or otherwise. Buyer shall not
settle any Claim covered by this Schedule 9.1(p) without the prior consent of
Sellers Indemnified Parties involved therein if any admission of wrong doing,
negligence or improper activity of any kind of such Sellers Indemnified Party
is a part of such settlement. Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of Sellers Indemnified Parties, effect any settlement of any pending
or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which Sellers
Indemnified Parties are or could have been a party and indemnity could have
been sought hereunder by Sellers Indemnified Party, unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of such Sellers Indemnified Party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or
proceeding.
