Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.      ##### 

  

 SECTION 2.03. Exchange of Certificates.    

 (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, no later than the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause an Affiliate (as defined in Section 9.11) other than the Surviving Corporation to, make available to the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.    

 (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person (as defined in Section 9.11) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to each Share formerly represented by such Certificate. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.03(e)), and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03, each Certificate shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.    

 (c) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby.    

 (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger     ##### 

    

Consideration from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    

 (e) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.    

 (f) No further Ownership Rights; Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (including the associated Rights). At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no further registration of transfers of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.    

 (g) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with Section 2.02 prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.    

 SECTION 2.04. Existing Stock Options.    

 (a) Settlement of Existing Stock Options. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of all option holders (such efforts to include, but not be limited to, delivery of written notice to all such option holders at least 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date requesting consent to the settlement of the Existing Stock Option held by each such holder in accordance with this Section 2.04) to the settlement of each option to acquire Shares (the "Existing Stock Options") granted under the Companys 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or the Companys 1992 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Stock Option Plans"), which is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, in exchange for the right to promptly receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each Share then subject to such Existing Stock Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price for such Share under such Existing Stock Option (such     ##### 

    

amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration"), subject
to applicable income and employment tax withholding amounts and
other statutory social charges (if any) required to be withheld by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable law. Each Existing
Stock Option for which such consent has been obtained shall be automatically
canceled at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof in exchange
for the payment of the Option Consideration. Payment of the Option
Consideration for each such Existing Stock Option shall be reduced by all
applicable income and employment tax withholding amounts and other statutory
social charges (if any) required to be withheld by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any applicable law.    

 (b) Adjustment. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume in full each Continued Stock Option (as defined in this Section 2.04(b)) and the related obligations provided herein. The assumption of a Continued Stock Option shall not modify (except as required hereunder) any of the terms thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Option Plans, the Company shall cause each Existing Stock Option for which the consent specified in Section 2.04(a) has not been obtained as of the Effective Time (the "Continued Stock Options") to be automatically converted at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, but subject to the Cash-Out Right of the holder thereof, into a right (each, an "Adjusted Award") with respect to the greatest whole number of preferred shares of Parent (the "Parent Shares") which is equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (x) the number of Shares covered by such Continued Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, expressed in Euros, converted using the Closing Date Exchange Rate, divided by (ii) the average of the closing prices for a Parent Share (the "Closing Trading Price") over the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time as reported on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and published in the _Handelsblatt_. Each such Adjusted Award shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, on exercise of any portion of such Adjusted Award prior to its expiration and on the same terms and conditions, _mutatis mutandis,_  as were applicable to the corresponding Continued Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the Exercise Trading Price on the date of exercise over the Adjusted Exercise Price applicable under such Adjusted Award, subject to applicable income and employment tax withholding amounts and other statutory social charges (if any) required to be withheld by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable law. The "Adjusted Exercise Price" for each Parent Share covered by an Adjusted Award shall equal the quotient of (i) the product of (x) the exercise price per Share applicable under the corresponding Continued Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, expressed in Euros converted using the Closing Date Exchange Rate, multiplied by (y) the number of Shares covered by such Continued Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (ii) the number of Parent Shares covered by such Adjusted Award immediately following the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 2.04(b), the exercise price applicable under each Continued Stock Option and the Merger Consideration shall be converted into Euros using the average of the exchange rates to convert one U.S. dollar into one Euro over the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time as published by the European Central Bank (the "Closing Date Exchange Rate"). The "Exercise Trading Price" shall equal the closing price of a Parent Share as reported on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and published in the _Handelsblatt_. For purposes of     ##### 

    

this Section 2.04, the term "Cash-Out Right" shall mean the right of
the holder of a Continued Stock Option to elect, during the 60-day
period commencing on the "Change in Control" (as defined in the Stock Option
Plans), to receive for each Share then subject to such Continued Stock
Option, whether or not vested, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Change in Control Price (as defined in the Stock Option Plans) over the
exercise price per Share applicable under the corresponding Continued Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, in settlement and
cancellation of each such Continued Stock Option, subject to applicable
income and employment tax withholding amounts and other statutory social
charges (if any) required to be withheld by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any applicable law.    

 (c) All administrative and other rights and authorities granted under the Stock Option Plans to the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee or designee thereof shall, following the Effective Time, reside with Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions, including amending the Stock Option Plans as required, necessary or appropriate to (i) preclude the grant of any options or other equity rights or awards under any of the Stock Option Plans from or after the Effective Time and (ii) permit the conversion of the Continued Stock Options in accordance with Section 2.04 (b).    

 SECTION 2.05. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions with respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan as may be necessary or appropriate (i) to preclude the commencement of any new "Offering," as defined thereunder, from or after the Effective Time, (ii) to terminate any current Offering no later than the last payroll date immediately preceding the Effective Time and cause all then outstanding options to purchase Shares in such Offering to be exercised on such payroll date for the purchase of Shares and (iii) to release from any "Holding Period," as defined in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, all Shares that have been purchased pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan prior to, and are outstanding as of, the Effective Time (the "ESPP Shares"), including the Shares purchased pursuant to this Section 2.05. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, each then outstanding ESPP Share shall be converted into and shall become the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, pursuant to Section 2.01(c), subject to applicable income and employment tax withholding amounts and other statutory social charges (if any) required to be withheld by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as may be necessary or appropriate so that the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and any and all rights under any provisions thereof shall terminate as of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the Company or any other Person.    

 SECTION 2.06. Stock Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as may be necessary to ensure that each stock unit (a "Stock Unit") that was granted under the Companys Amended and Restated Management Deferred Compensation Plan or the Amended and Restated Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plans") and that is outstanding at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration (in the aggregate, the "Stock Unit Consideration"). Each participant in the Deferred Compensation Plans who has, prior to the date hereof, elected to     ##### 

    

receive his or her "Account Balances," as defined thereunder, upon a "Change
in Control," as defined thereunder, shall receive prompt payment of
the Merger Consideration for his/her Stock Units and the then value of
his/her remaining Account Balances, subject to applicable income and
employment tax withholding amounts and other statutory social charges (if
any) required to be withheld by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any applicable law. With respect to each other participant in the Deferred
Compensation Plans, the Merger Consideration for his/her Stock Units shall be
transferred to the "rabbi" trust established and in effect as of the date
hereof for the applicable Deferred Compensation Plan and credited to his/her
Cash Account, as defined thereunder, and remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company shall
not permit any participant in the Deferred Compensation Plans to select or
change his/her "Change in Control Payment Method" (as defined in the Deferred
Compensation Plans) after the date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the Companys chief executive officer
shall take such actions as may be necessary so that, from and after the
Effective Time, the Plan Administrator of each Deferred Compensation Plan
shall be one or more persons selected by the Surviving Corporation or its
designee. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate to preclude the grant or allocation of any stock
units or other equity rights or awards under any of the Deferred Compensation
Plans with respect to compensation earned after December 31, 2003. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents of
individuals which may be required for amendments to, or changes in, the
Deferred Compensation Plans. Upon execution of the Consent set forth in
Section 2.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and designation of the post-
Effective Time Plan Administrator in accordance with this Section 2.06, and
after making the efforts to obtain consents required by the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company shall be deemed to have taken all actions
required by this Section 2.06.    

ARTICLE III    

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   

Except as (i) set forth with respect to a specifically
identified representation and warranty referenced in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule") and with respect to any other
representation and warranty to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from
the face of any such disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedule that such
disclosure should qualify such other representation and warranty; or (ii)
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.05(a)) filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 9.11). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent and
Merger Sub accurate and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in
effect for the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any Person

There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.    

 (b) The Company or another of its Subsidiaries is the record and beneficial owner of all the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interest of each Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance     ##### 

    

of any kind, and there are no irrevocable proxies with respect to any
such shares. There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock
or other voting securities or ownership interests in any Subsidiary of
the Company, (ii) options, warrants, rights or other agreements or
commitments to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or

 SECTION 3.03. Authority for this Agreement. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, except for the Required Company Vote (as defined in Section 3.19), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or any of its Affiliates or stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated, other than, with respect to completion of the Merger, the adoption of the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the DGCL) contained within this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares prior to the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.    

 SECTION 3.04. Consents and Approvals; No Violation.

on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (e) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
assets are bound, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for any of
the foregoing that are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), in each case, that is required by U.S. GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or related financial statement footnotes, except for (i) liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) liabilities and obligations reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 included in the Company SEC Reports and (iii) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 27, 2003 which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VI    

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS    

 SECTION 6.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting _._  (a) The Company will, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in connection with the vote of the stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger in preliminary form and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, to prepare and file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Parent shall promptly provide any information or responses to comments or other assistance reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall give reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by Parent.    

 (b) The Company shall take all lawful action to (i) cause a special meeting of its stockholders (such meeting or any adjournment thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement, and the Merger, and (ii) solicit proxies from its stockholders to obtain the Required Company Vote for such approval and adoption. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and adoption of the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and the     ##### 

    

Merger by the Companys stockholders and, except as permitted by
Section 6.02, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not withdraw, amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent such recommendation (or announce
publicly its intention to do so).    

 SECTION 6.02. Acquisition Proposals. (a) The Company shall not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives (including investment bankers, attorneys and accountants), agents and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations with respect to, or provide any information, or afford any access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise take any action to assist or facilitate, any Person or group in respect of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to compliance with Section 6.02(c) and the prior execution by such Person or group of a confidentiality agreement in no material respect less favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision), the Company may furnish information to or enter into discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with any Person or group that has made an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines is likely to result in a Superior Proposal and that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02(a) if, and only to the extent that, the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, determines in good faith that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law.    

 (b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours) notify Parent, orally and in writing, if any such information is requested or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated and will promptly communicate to Parent the identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry (the "Potential Acquiror") and any other terms of such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. If, in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.02, the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or Affiliates) participates in discussions or negotiations with, or provides information to, a Potential Acquiror, the Company will keep Parent advised on a current basis of any significant developments with respect thereto.    

 (c) The Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Associates conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.    

 (d) Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation of the Merger as set forth in Section 6.01 unless the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of     ##### 

    

Directors of the Company under applicable law, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) redeem the Rights or amend, or take any other action with respect to,
the Rights Agreement to facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement meeting the criteria described in Section 6.02(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company receives a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, if it determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law, approve
or recommend such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement as permitted
pursuant to the terms of Section 8.03(b) (and, at its option, concurrently
with or immediately after such termination cause the Company to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal), but only at a
time that is after the third Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors
has received a Superior Proposal and providing Parent with the identity of
the Potential Acquiror and the terms of such Superior Proposal (attaching, if
in writing, the most current version of such proposal or agreement), with the
intent of enabling Parent to match such proposal and to agree to a
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected. Without limiting any other
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement in respect of any such
action, any withdrawal or modification by the Company of the approval or
recommendation of the Merger or any termination of this Agreement shall not
have any effect on the approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for
the purpose of causing Section 203 of the DGCL, any other takeover statute,
and the Rights Agreement to be inapplicable to, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which approvals and actions are
irrevocable.    

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking any action or making any disclosure required by applicable law.    

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the assets of, or at least 20% of the equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger and (ii) "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that (a) if consummated, would result in the third party making such proposal (or, in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring all of the Shares or all of the voting power of the Company and (b) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company,     ##### 

    

including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
and expected timing and risks of consummation, and the ability of such
third party to obtain financing for the Acquisition Proposal and taking into
account all other legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal) is more favorable to the Persons to whom it owes fiduciary duties
under applicable laws than the Merger.    

 SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    

 SECTION 6.04. Certain Filings. (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall make promptly any required submissions under the HSR Act which the Company or Parent determines should be made, in each case, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other federal, state or foreign law or regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the Companys business in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers. Parent and the Company shall take or undertake all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or jurisdiction (each, a "Government Antitrust Entity") may assert under relevant antitrust, or competition laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.    

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section 6.04(a), (i) Parent shall proffer its willingness to (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or of any United States Subsidiary of Parent, (B) terminate such existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations and (C) amend or terminate such existing licenses or other intellectual property agreements and to enter into such new licenses or other intellectual property agreements (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with the relevant Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action is likely to be necessary for the purpose of avoiding or preventing any action by any Government Antitrust Entity to seek to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Outside Date (as defined in Section 8.02(a)); (ii) Parent shall take promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps     ##### 

    

contemplated by clause (i) of this subsection (b)) necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Outside Date; (iii) each of the Company and Parent
will keep the other informed of any material communication and provide to the
other copies of all correspondence, between it (or its advisors) and any
Government Antitrust Entity relating to this Agreement or any of the matters
described in this Section 6.04; and (iv) each of the Company and Parent shall
permit the other to review any material communication to be given by it to,
and shall consult with each other in advance of any telephonic calls, meeting
or conference with, any Government Antitrust Entity and, to the extent
permitted, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such telephonic calls, meeting or conference with, any Government Antitrust
Entity and, to the extent permitted, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such telephonic calls, meetings and conferences.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no failure to obtain termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act shall be deemed to be a breach hereunder by
the Company. Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall be principally
responsible for and in control of the process of dealing with any Government
Antitrust Entity relating to its obligations under subsections (b)(i) and
(b)(ii) hereof.    

 SECTION 6.05. Public Announcements. Each of Parent and the Company will consult with one another before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or by the applicable regulations of any relevant stock exchange.    

 SECTION 6.06. Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification for liabilities, and all limitations with respect to liability, existing in favor of any person included in the ambit of the indemnification provisions in Article IX of the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Section 6.7 of the Companys Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof (an "Indemnified Person"), as provided in the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws and any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of six years from the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that in the event any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, all such rights, liabilities and limitations in respect of any such claim shall continue until disposition thereof; provided further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or any such agreement, as the case may be, for purposes of the allowance of indemnification or advancement of expenses, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to Parent.    

 (b) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy ("DandO Insurance") for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage (including pursuant to Parents own policy) and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further that, subject to the preceding proviso, if the existing DandO     ##### 

    

Insurance expires or is canceled during such period, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance; and provided
further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required
to pay an annual premium for DandO Insurance in excess of 200% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, but in such case,
shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. In lieu of
maintaining such DandO Insurance, Parent shall have the option to purchase a
tail insurance policy providing substantially similar coverage and amounts as
provided by the DandO Insurance.    

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this Section 6.06.    

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under applicable law, agreement or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons, their heirs and representatives.    

 SECTION 6.07. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement, which is qualified as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation or warranty of such party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby not to be satisfied, (iv) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any Material Contract, (v) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, (vi) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or other proceedings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) commenced or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.10 or which relate to the consummation of the Merger, (vii) any notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (viii) any event or occurrence that is, or would reasonably be likely to be, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.      ##### 

  

 SECTION 6.08. Employee Matters. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with their terms all collective bargaining agreements, existing supplemental pension arrangements, existing employment, severance and change of control agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries specified in Section 6.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume expressly and agree to perform each agreement with an individual specified in Section 6.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if the Merger had not taken place. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations in respect of commitments or elections made by members of the Companys Board of Directors prior to the date of this Agreement under the Directors Charitable Award Program.    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2005, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, the Companys Separation Pay Plan in Event of a Change in Control and the Companys Enhanced Severance Pay Plan for Terminated Employees (the "Severance Plans") and the Deferred Compensation Plans, as such plans exist on the date hereof (except that there will be no Stock Unit Accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plans).    

 (c) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2005, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide to those individuals who are employed by any such entity at the Effective Time and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with (i) an annual salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable to such individuals than the salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunities provided to each such individuals by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee compensation and benefit plans (including retiree medical plans) no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding for these purposes the Stock Option Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the provision of a Stock Unit Account in the Deferred Compensation Plans and any other equity based arrangement).    

 (d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement) prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting and eligibility and benefit accrual purposes under employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plan for those purposes; provided, however, that such service shall not be credited for benefit accrual purposes to the extent that such credit would result in recognition of the same period of service under duplicate Plans. Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation under any health plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries     ##### 

    

and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, give such
employees credit under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles
satisfied prior to the Effective Time.    

 (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries will consult with Parent with respect to any communication (written, electronic or oral) intended to be broadly circulated, or available generally, to any of their respective employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment.    

 (f) The parties agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change in Control" for all purposes of all Company Plans. The parties further agree that for purposes of this Section 6.08(f), the term "Change in Control" shall include all equivalent terms as required by context (by way of illustration and not limitation, "Change of Control").

EXHIBIT A    

FORM OF    

AMENDED AND RESTATED    

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION    

OF    

SURVIVING CORPORATION    

 FIRST: The name of the corporation is The Dial Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation").    

 SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be located at 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400 in the City of Wilmington, in the State of Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent at that address is Corporation Service Company.    

 THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.    

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock and the par value of each of such shares is $0.01.    

 FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:   

A-1    

* * *

 

##### 

     

 (1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.    

 (2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends.    

 (3) The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any other reason.    

 (4) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws    

A-2    

* * *

 

##### 

    

from time to time made by the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-
laws so made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have
been valid if such by-law had not been made.    

 SIXTH: Each person who is or was or had agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or each such person who is or was serving or who had agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including the heirs, executor, administrators or estate of such person), shall be indemnified by the Corporation, in accordance with the by-laws of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, if permitted by applicable law, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) or any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter are in effect. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation, and to persons serving as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of the Corporation, with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. The Corporation shall be required to indemnify any person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors or is a proceeding to enforce such persons claim to indemnification pursuant to the rights granted by this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise by the Corporation. Without limiting the generality of the effect of the foregoing, the Corporation may enter into one or more agreements with any person which    

A-3    

* * *

 

##### 

    

provide for indemnification greater or different than that provided in this
seventh paragraph. Any amendment or repeal of this seventh paragraph shall
not adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of
any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.    

 SEVENTH: A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any amendment or repeal of this eighth paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.    

 EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a    

A-4    

* * *

 

##### 

    

majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors
or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of
the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement
and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such
compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.    

 NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power, provided, however, that any amendment or repeal of the seventh or eighth paragraphs of this Certificate of Incorporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
