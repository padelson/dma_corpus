</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties
hereto or any holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of

Surviving Corporation.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each Share
that is held by the Company as treasury stock or that is owned by Parent or any
of its or the Company&#146;s respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (as defined in
Section&nbsp;9.11) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section&nbsp;2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and

to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (a &#147;<B>Certificate</B>&#148;) shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share.
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.02. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders exercising appraisal
rights available under Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (the &#147;<B>Dissenting Shares</B>&#148;) shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section&nbsp;262 of the
DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holder&#146;s Shares
shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a)&nbsp;prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the &#147;fair value&#148;
of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL, and (b)&nbsp;the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or
settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates (the &#147;<B>Paying Agent</B>&#148;), and, no later than the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause an Affiliate (as defined in Section&nbsp;9.11) other
than the Surviving Corporation to, make available to the Paying Agent
sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) upon
surrender of Certificates (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the
&#147;<B>Payment Fund</B>&#148;). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as
provided in this Agreement.
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time,
of an outstanding Certificate, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person (as defined in Section&nbsp;9.11) shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger
Consideration with respect to each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as
specified in Section&nbsp;2.03(e)), and such Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time
and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.03,
each Certificate shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive,
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash
multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any
interest thereon.
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
thereby.

Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any

Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms
of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
(including the associated Rights). At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no further registration of transfers
of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article&nbsp;II, subject to applicable law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one year after
the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former
stockholders of the Company who have not complied with Section&nbsp;2.02 prior to
the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior
to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law unclaimed funds payable with respect
to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to compliance with Section&nbsp;6.02(c)
and the prior execution by such Person or group of a confidentiality agreement
in no material respect less favorable to the Company than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain a standstill provision), the Company may furnish information to or
enter into discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal

Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines is

of this Section&nbsp;6.02(a) if, and only to the extent that, the Board of Directors
of the Company, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,

of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(including the heirs, executor, administrators or estate of such person), shall
be indemnified by the Corporation, in accordance with the by-laws of the
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, if permitted by applicable law, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment) or any other applicable laws as presently
or hereafter are in effect. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of
Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation,
and to persons serving as employees or agents of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of the
Corporation, with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of
directors and officers. The Corporation shall be required to indemnify any
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors or is a proceeding to enforce such
person&#146;s claim to indemnification pursuant to the rights granted by this
Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise by the Corporation. Without limiting

derived an improper personal benefit. Any amendment or repeal of this eighth
paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on the Corporation.

repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred
herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved
