               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the securities set forth below:

     (a) Conversion Generally. Each Company Common Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company Common Shares to be canceled


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting Shares referred to in Section 3.6)
shall be converted, subject to other provisions of this Section 3.1 and Section
3.2(e), into the right to receive (i) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to
a fraction, rounded down to the nearest one thousandth of a share, the numerator
of which equals 22,621,922 (the "Maximum Parent Common Shares") and the
denominator of which equals the number of Total Outstanding Shares (the "Stock
Consideration") and (ii) an amount in cash without interest equal to (A)
$42,950,000 (the "Maximum Cash Consideration") less the Aggregate Stock Option
Consideration, divided by (B) the number of Total Outstanding Shares (the "Cash
Consideration" and together with the Stock Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to other provisions
of this Section 3.1, Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.6.

     (b) Alternative Merger Consideration. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, Parent, in its sole discretion, may advise the Company that in lieu
of issuing up to 3,500,000 shares (the "Share Election Number") of the Stock
Consideration, Parent may increase the aggregate Cash Consideration by an amount
equal to $2.00 multiplied by the Share Election Number (the "Alternative Merger
Consideration Option"). If Parent elects the Alternative Merger Consideration
Option, then the calculation of Merger Consideration in Section 3.1(a) shall be
adjusted to reflect that the Maximum Parent Common Shares shall be reduced by
the Share Election Number and the Maximum Cash Consideration shall be increased
by an amount equal to $2.00 multiplied by the Share Election Number

     (c) Cancellation of Shares. Each Company Common Share held, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by the Company (including as treasury stock or
otherwise), Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Company, Parent or Merger
Sub shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

     (d) Change in Shares. In the event of the issuance or existence of any
Company Common Shares in excess of the Maximum Parent Common Shares or any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization,
reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to the Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares occurring after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
and all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class
or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based
upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor)
affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide
the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
the determination of the existence or issuance of Company Common Shares in
excess of the Maximum Parent Common Shares or such stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change; provided, however, that in no event will
any Parent Common Shares in excess of the Maximum Parent Common Shares be
issued.

     (e) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of
capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on
the part of the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of the
Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so
converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation's capital stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). Each
certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock will
evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     (f) Total Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that
in no event shall Parent issue in the Merger more than 22,621,922 Parent Common
Shares or pay more than $42,950,000 (except with respect to the cash out of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.2(e) or the election of the Alternative
Merger Consideration Option pursuant to Section 3.1(b)).

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Procedures.

          (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) (i) a letter of transmittal that shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates
representing such holder's Company Common Shares ("Certificates") to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting surrender by such holder of
Certificates to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

          (ii) The holder of each Certificate, upon the surrender by such holder
to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate, together with the letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed by such holder in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange for such Certificate (x) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Stock Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article 3, and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings) of (A) the cash amount that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) plus (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares plus (C) any non-stock dividends and any other dividends or
other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash amount payable
upon surrender of any Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Stock
Consideration, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender
of the Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in respect thereof,
may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
certificate for shares of Stock Consideration is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting
such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for shares of Parent Common Shares in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable.

     (b) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), and (ii) enter into an exchange agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, with such Exchange Agent for
the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article 3. Prior
to the Effective Time (or, if after the Effective Time, promptly after the
declaration and payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Parent Common
Shares), Parent or a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article 3,
through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing Parent Common Shares,
(ii) cash and (iii) any dividends or other distributions with respect to the
Parent Common Shares to be issued or paid pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2(c) to
deliver to the holders of Company Common Shares (other than any Company Common


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting Shares) the
aggregate Merger Consideration plus any non-stock dividends and any other
dividends or other distribution to be distributed pursuant to Section 3.2(c)
(such cash and certificates for shares of Stock Consideration, together with the
amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") deliverable pursuant to
Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding Company Common Shares. The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1 plus any
non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions to be
distributed pursuant to Section 3.2(c) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purposes.

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting.

          (i) All shares of Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
the Parent Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect
of all the Stock Consideration, and Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent such dividend or distribution in accordance with Section 3.2(b). No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Stock Consideration shall be
paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article 3. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Stock Consideration issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A)
at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Stock Consideration and not paid and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such
whole shares of Stock Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time
but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

          (ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of
whole shares of Stock Consideration entitled to be received by such holders
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, regardless of whether such holders have
exchanged their Certificates.

     (d) Further Rights in Company Common Shares. All Merger Consideration
issued and paid upon conversion of the Company Common Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Shares.

     (e) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Stock Consideration will be issued and any
holder of Company Common Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Stock
Consideration but for this Section 3.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent
in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fraction of a share of Parent
Common Shares that the Company Common shareholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive multiplied by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price.

     (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Stock Consideration)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Shares for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holders of Company
Common Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar Laws) for payment of the Cash Consideration, and for


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

delivery of any certificates for shares of Stock Consideration of such
stockholders and payment of any cash, dividends and other distributions in
respect thereof payable and/or issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 and Section
3.2(c) upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu
thereof), in each case, without any interest thereon, only as a general
unsecured creditor thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

     (g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Acquirer Management, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any Person, including any former holder of Company Common Shares, for
any cash or certificates for shares of Parent Common Shares from the Exchange
Fund properly delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

     (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent in their respective discretion, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

     (i) Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares or
Company Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Law, or pursuant to other
applicable judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Shares or Company Options in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

Section 3.3 Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and, thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Shares theretofore outstanding on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Laws. On and
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

Section 3.4 Convertible Securities.

     (a) Each outstanding Company Option shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and after
surrender thereof, an amount (payable in cash only out of the aggregate Merger
Consideration) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares that were
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

the amount by which the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) the Parent
Average Closing Price exceeds the exercise price per share under such Company
Option (the "Stock Option Consideration"), such amount to be further reduced by
any required withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section 3.2(i) hereof. The Stock
Option Consideration shall be calculated in accordance with the iterative
process set forth in the spreadsheet attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D;
provided, however, that the parties acknowledge that the spreadsheet is only an
illustrative calculation because the Parent Average Closing Price and the number
of Company Options outstanding will change between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time. For purposes of clarification, the amount of cash
payable to holders of In the Money Options shall reduce the Maximum Cash
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a) available to be paid pursuant to
Sections 3.1(a) and (b) to holders of Company Common Shares.

     (b) Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
which is not entitled to any Stock Option Consideration shall not be assumed or
substituted by Parent but shall vest and become fully exercisable pursuant to
the terms of the applicable option agreement. Any vested Company Option which is
not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and be void as of the
Effective Time.

     (c) The Company shall take all action necessary in order to effect the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4 as of the Effective Time. Any materials
to be submitted to the holders of Company Options shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

Section 3.5 Unvested Company Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall have cancelled, repurchased, accelerated, vested or otherwise
extinguished or awarded all Company Common Shares that are restricted, not fully
vested or subject to any other restriction ("Unvested Company Shares") and there
shall be no Unvested Company Shares at the Effective Time.

Section 3.6 Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who properly has
demanded appraisal for such Company Common Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration and instead such stockholder shall be entitled to
receive payment for such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL, the right of such holder to such appraisal of its Company Common
Shares shall cease, and such Company Common Shares shall be deemed converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article 3. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands (or purported demands) for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. Parent shall direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL and the Company shall not, except with Parent's prior written consent, (i)
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for
Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle, or settle, any such demands, (iii)
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with the DGCL, or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

     (a) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has Made Available to
Parent a true, correct and complete copy of, with respect to the Company, any
Company Subsidiary and any ERISA Affiliate, (i) all employee benefit plans
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, (ii) all stock option, stock
purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, stock-based compensation,
supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, employee relocation, cafeteria
benefit (Section 125 of the Code), dependent care (Section 129 of the Code),
life insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (iii) all
bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, retirement, deferred compensation or
incentive plans, programs and arrangements, and (iv) other fringe and employee
benefit plans, programs or arrangements that apply to senior management and that
do not generally apply to all employees under which any of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate could reasonably be expected to have any
liability (all of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through (iv),
collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"), and any related plan documents
(including adoption agreements, vendor Contracts and administrative services
agreements, trust documents, insurance policies or Contracts, including policies
relating to fiduciary liability insurance, bonds required by ERISA, amendments
to the Company Benefit Plans, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions, and
summaries of material modifications and any material employee communications of
the Company relating to changes to the Company Benefit Plans) and has, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting
requirements, Made Available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the
Form 5500 reports filed (including all audits, financial statements, schedules
and attachments thereto), and any applicable non-discrimination tests conducted,
for the last three (3) plan years. Each Company Benefit Plan can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued as of the Closing Date in accordance with
its terms, without liability to Parent or its Subsidiaries. Any Company Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and has obtained from the IRS a current favorable determination letter as to its
qualified status under the Code. The Company has also Made Available to Parent a
true, correct and complete copy of the most recent such IRS determination
letter, with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan, and nothing has occurred
since the issuance of each such letter that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan subject
to Section 401(a) of the Code. The Company has also Made Available to Parent all
registration statements and prospectuses and investment policy statements
prepared in connection with each Company Benefit Plan. All individuals who,
pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit Plan, are entitled to participate
in any Company Benefit Plan, are currently participating in such Company Benefit
Plan or have been offered an opportunity to do so and have declined in writing.
Except as otherwise disclosed on Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate
sponsors or maintains any self-funded employee benefit plan, including any plan
to which a stop-loss policy applies.

     (b) None of the Company Benefit Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") or
applicable state law. There has been no "prohibited transaction" (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that is not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA. Each
Company Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), and the Company, each Company Subsidiary and
each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to be performed by
it under, is not in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of
any default or violation by any other party to, any of the Company Benefit
Plans. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

subject to any liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code
or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans. All
contributions required to be made by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their
due dates and, to the extent required by GAAP, all amounts have been accrued for
the current plan year (and no further contributions will be due or will have
accrued thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, after the
Company Balance Sheet Date as a result of the operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries after the Company Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement, the Company and each Company Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate have at
all times made timely deposits of employee salary reduction contributions and
participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to regulations issued by the
United States Department of Labor. No Company Benefit Plan is subject to, and
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has incurred
or reasonably expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than
for the payment of insurance premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation). No Company Benefit Plan has an accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code. With respect to each Company
Benefit Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension benefit plan within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and
timely filed all requisite governmental reports (which were true, correct and
complete as of the date filed), including any required audit reports, and has
properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to
employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such
Company Benefit Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought or is threatened, against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit
or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor.

     (c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a
party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation
under, any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA. There has been no termination or partial termination of any Company
Benefit Plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code.

     (d) Except as otherwise disclosed on Section 4.10(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or any termination of employment or service in connection
therewith or subsequent thereto will not (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any Person other than accrued payments, (ii) materially increase
or otherwise enhance any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits, except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the
Code, (iv) increase the amount of compensation due to any Person, or (v) result
in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Person.

     (e) Except as otherwise disclosed on Section 4.10(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any Company
Subsidiary has granted, or is a party to any contract that grants, any
compensation, equity award or bonus that could be deemed deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and neither the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or obligation to
make any payments or issue any equity award or bonus that could be deemed
deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Neither
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains
or administers any Company Benefit Plan that would be deemed a deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

     Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent,
Acquirer Management and Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with the

currently proposed by it to be conducted. Each of Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,

licensing or good standing necessary.

     (b) None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any
other Person (other than a Parent Subsidiary), except as set forth in Section

Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or obligation to make any
payments or issue any equity award or bonus that could be deemed deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Neither Parent, any

any kind to any third party. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
received any written notice of the infringement of or challenge to the validity
or enforceability of, and, to Parent's knowledge, there are no claims pending
with respect to the rights of others to the use of, any Parent Intellectual
Property that, in any such case as would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.


                                      -39-

Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the Company will

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

(i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or induce
the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue
any communications (except solely to provide written or oral notice as to the
existence of these provisions) or negotiations regarding, or deliver or make

connection with, any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that

with any Persons conducted prior to or on the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished to any Person with which
the Company has engaged in any such activities within the 12-month period
preceding the date of this Agreement. The Company shall not, and shall not
permit any Company Subsidiary to, waive any rights under any standstill,
confidentiality or similar contracts entered into by such Person. If any
Representative of the Company, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any
other capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this
Section 6.7 to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that its
Representatives do not take, then the Company shall be deemed for all purposes
of this Agreement to have breached this Section 6.7.

     (b) Notice. The Company, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other notice that any Person is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) any request for non-public
information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, as well as, in the event of any of clause (i)-(iv) above, (1) the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression
of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request and (2) the identity of the
Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The Company will (x) keep Parent
informed, as promptly as practicable, of the status and details (including any
amendments, modifications or proposed amendments or modifications) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice
or request and (y) provide to Parent, as promptly as practicable, a copy of all
written materials and other information provided to the Company in connection
with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal,
offer, notice or request. The Company shall provide Parent with at least five
(5) Business Days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of the Company Board but in no event less than twenty-four (24) hours)
of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably
expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal, including to determine whether
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer.

     (c) Superior Offers. In the event that any Person submits to the Company
(and does not withdraw) an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
reasonably concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) is, or is reasonably
likely to become, a Superior Offer, then notwithstanding Section 6.7(a), the
Company may, so long as the Company Stockholders Approval has not yet been
obtained, (i) enter into discussions with such Person regarding such Acquisition


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

Proposal, and (ii) deliver or make available to such Person non-public
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided, that:
(A) in each case, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
Representative of the Company shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.7; (B) in each case, the Company Board first shall have
concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
such action is reasonably required in order for the Company Board to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Laws;
(C) in each case the Company first shall have provided Parent with two Business
Days' written notice of the identity of such Person and all of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the Company's intention
to take actions in response to such Superior Offer, specifying the actions it
intends to take; (D) in the case of clause (ii), the Company first shall have
received from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms
at least as restrictive with regard to the Company's confidential information as
the Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement shall not include any provision for any exclusive right to negotiate
with such Person or having the actual or purported effect of restricting the
Company from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement; and (E) prior to
or contemporaneously with delivering or making available any such nonpublic
information to such Person, the Company shall deliver such non-public
information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been
previously delivered by the Company to Parent and, to the extent previously
delivered, the Company delivers to Parent a complete list identifying all such
non-public information delivered to such Person).

     (d) Changes of Recommendation. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company Board from (i) withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying the
Company Board Recommendation or (ii) terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(i) simultaneously with the payment of the Termination Fee if (A) the
Company Stockholders Approval has not yet been obtained, (B) the Company shall
not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.5 or this
Section 6.7, (C) a Superior Offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn,
(D) the Company shall have promptly provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice
of Superior Offer") advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior
Offer and that it intends (or may intend) to change the Company Board
Recommendation or terminate the agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i) and the
manner and timing in which it intends (or may intend) to do so, (E) Parent shall
not have, within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of national
standing) to be at least as favorable to the Company's stockholders as such
Superior Offer (it being agreed that (1) the Company Board shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof, (2) that the Company Board will not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify
the Company Board Recommendation or terminate the agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(i) for five (5) Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Superior Offer, and (3) any change to the financial or other material terms of
such Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior Offer to Parent and a
new five (5) Business Day period under this clause (E), and (F) the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer and any offer made by Parent
pursuant to Section 6.7(d)(E), the Company Board is required under applicable
Law to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law.) For purposes of clarification, compliance with the provisions
of this Section 6.7(d) for changing the Company Board Recommendation shall not
be deemed an Effect that would materially impede or delay the Company's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within the meaning
of "Material Adverse Effect".

     (e) Compliance with Tender Offer Rules. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or taking any action by an order or decree of any


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Governmental Entity; provided, however, that neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board
Recommendation unless specifically permitted to do so pursuant to Section 6.7(d)
or otherwise as required by the fiduciary duties of the Company Board (including
the fiduciary duty of disclosure).

Section 6.8 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

     (a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall apply for or otherwise seek, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for
the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, (i) as soon as practicable, and
in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, make any initial filings required under the HSR Act and (ii) any
other additional filings required by any other applicable Antitrust Laws. The
parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, afford one another
(or one another's counsel) an opportunity to review in advance any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other Antitrust Law;
provided, however, that, with respect to any such analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals, each of
Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies
(or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Law
applicable to such party requires such party or the Company Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information. Unless
otherwise agreed, to the extent reasonably practical and permitted by applicable
Law, no party shall have any material discussions or communications with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without, where practical, consulting with a Representative of the
other party.

     (b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any
comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any
filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Laws.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.8(a), each party will
promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

     (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, Council Regulation 139/2004 of the European
Community and any other federal, state or foreign or supranational statutes,
rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods or the receipt of approval decisions under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the following actions to the
extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable Laws regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) entering into negotiations, (ii) providing
information required by Law, and (iii) substantially complying with any "second
request" for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.


                                      -51-

     (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that (i)
Parent and the Company shall not have any obligation to litigate or contest any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, and (ii)
Parent shall be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out
agreements or submit to orders providing for a Divestiture.

     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.8 shall limit a party's right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party has until such date
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9 Certain Notices. Each of the Company and Parent will notify the
other party in writing promptly after learning of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, (iii)
any action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation by
or before any Governmental Entity initiated by or against it or any of its
Subsidiaries, or known by it or any of its Subsidiaries to be threatened against
it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or stockholders in their capacity as such, or of any verbal or written
correspondence from any Person asserting or implying a claim against the Company
or Parent or with respect to any of their respective assets or properties
(including Intellectual Property), (iv) any change, occurrence or event not in
the ordinary course of the Company's or Parent's or any of their respective
Subsidiary's business, of any change, occurrence or event that would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate with any other
changes, occurrences and events, a Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or that is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to
closing set forth in Article 7 not to be satisfied, or (v) any claim, or any
verbal or written inquiry by any Tax Authority, regarding Taxes in excess of
$5,000 payable by the Company or Parent. Each of Parent and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other party of any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or any failure of it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, provided, however, that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

Section 6.10 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company have agreed to the
text of the press release announcing the signing of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Other than with respect to any announcement
relating to any action specifically permitted to be taken by the Company
pursuant to Section 6.7(d), Parent and the Company shall provide to each other
any subsequent press releases related to this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall consult with each other before
issuing or making any such release. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided that either party may, without
obtaining the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statements as such party determines in good faith, following
consultation with legal counsel, are required by fiduciary duty, Law or (with
respect to the Company) the rules and regulations of the AMEX, or (with respect
to Parent) the rules and regulations of the OTCBB, if it has used reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party. Each of Parent and the Company shall
cause its employees, officers and directors to comply with this Section 6.10.


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

Section 6.11 Indemnification.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will assume, and will cause
the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, the obligations
of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and its directors and officers set forth on Section 6.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any
indemnification and advancement provisions under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in
each case, subject to applicable Law. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and advancement that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law.

     (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained directors' and officers' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
individual who at the date of this Agreement was an Indemnified Party covered as
of the date hereof or hereafter by the Company's D&O Insurance on terms with
respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or
Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal
to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto;
provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent
and Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six-year period as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall
have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the Company's D&O
Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Company's existing D&O Insurance, and such "tail" policy
shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.11.

     (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, or at Parent's
option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

     (d) This Section 6.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives,
and may not be amended, altered or repealed with respect to any Indemnified
Party after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior to
the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 8.3).

Section 6.12 Employees.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Merger Sub shall have
the rights and obligations described in this Section 6.12 regarding the
individuals who were employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time and who continue employment with the Company or a Company Subsidiary or
Parent following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"). With respect to
any Continuing Employee (i) Parent and the Company shall confer and work
together in good faith to determine appropriate employment terms, and (ii) the


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

Company shall, in good faith, cooperate with Parent and assist Parent with its
efforts to enter into offer letters, assignment of invention agreements and
related documents after the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the
Closing Date including each such individual who is on vacation, temporary
layoff, leave of absence, sick leave or short- or long-term disability leave.

     (b) Within a reasonable period of time after the last Business Day of each
month after the date of this Agreement and on or about the date that is five (5)
Business Days prior to the expected date on which the Closing will occur, the
Company shall, as and to the extent necessary, deliver to Parent a revised
Section 4.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which sets forth each Person
who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as of the date such
revised Section 4.15(b) is delivered to Parent.

     (c) Parent, in the event it does not continue the employee welfare benefit
plans sponsored and maintained by the Company, will take commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Continuing Employees to be eligible for employee welfare
benefits that are substantially similar to the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. To the extent Parent elects to
have Continuing Employees, and their eligible dependents where applicable,
participate in Parent's employee benefit plans, programs or policies following
the Closing Date, (i) Parent will allow such Continuing Employees, and their
eligible dependents where applicable, to participate in such plans, programs and
policies on terms substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) each such Continuing Employee will
receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under such
plans for years of service with Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to
the Closing Date (except, for the avoidance of doubt, such prior service credit
shall not apply to any equity compensation plans, policies or arrangement of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), provided such credit does not result in
duplication of benefits, and (iii) Parent, to the extent required by applicable
Law and as permitted by the terms of the applicable group health plans, will
cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health plans
of Parent in which such employees and their eligible dependents will participate
to be waived.

     (d) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Severance and Retention
Policy described in Section 6.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Made
Available to Parent.

Section 6.13 Termination of Benefit Plans..

     (a) Conditioned on the Closing, the Company shall terminate the Radiologix,
Inc. 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Single Employer 401(k) Plan"),
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the Company's Board resolutions
terminating the Single Employer 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing.

     (b) To the extent the Closing occurs during the 2006 calendar year, the

the Merger and Parent may direct the Exchange Agent not to issue certificates
representing Parent Common Shares received by any such affiliate until Parent
has received from such Person an Affiliates Letter. Parent may issue
certificates representing Parent Common Shares received by such affiliates
bearing a customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and
the provisions of this Section 6.22.

respect to, or the consummation of, an Acquisition Proposal. All payments under
this Section 8.2(d) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent. The Company and Parent acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements,

the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due to the other party

party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the party failing to
make payment for all or any portion of the amounts set forth in this Section

Company Stockholders Approval and Parent Stockholders Approval have been
obtained, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval that, by
Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires
further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Section 8.4 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver
or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.5 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 8.2, all Expenses incurred by
the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that has
incurred the same; provided, however, that each of Parent and the Company shall

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

Section 9.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of

negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Parent Subsidiary without
the Company's consent.

Section 9.7 Parties in Interest.. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant

submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or Federal court of the United States of
America, located in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment
relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
(i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such Delaware court or, to the extent permitted by Law,
in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and

of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware or Federal court,
and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by Law.

     (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND

TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH

PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (2) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(3) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (4) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

Section 9.10 Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any section of a party's

Disclosure Schedule, but only to the extent that it would be readily apparent
that such matter on its face would apply to a particular section of a party's
Disclosure Schedule. The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds
for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of
materiality hereunder.

counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.12 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party hereto
agrees to waive any requirement for the posting of, or securing of, a bond in
connection with any such remedy.

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

                                VOTING AGREEMENT

     This Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of July 6, 2006, by and
between Primedex Health Systems, Inc., a New York corporation ("Primedex"), and
Contrarian Equity Fund, L.P. (the "Stockholder"). Terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement (defined below).

     WHEREAS, Radiologix, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Radiologix"), Primedex,
Radnet Management, Inc. and PR Acquisition Corporation have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated and in effect as of the date hereof (as the
same may be amended or supplemented for ministerial changes or corrections, the
"Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger (the "Merger") of an indirect
subsidiary of Primedex with and into Radiologix, with Radiologix surviving the
Merger and becoming a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Primedex upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

     WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder beneficially owns the
number of shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share ("Radiologix Common
Stock"), of Radiologix set forth opposite its name on Schedule A attached hereto
(such shares of Radiologix Common Stock, referred to herein as the "Subject
Shares"); and

     WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Primedex has requested that the Stockholder enter into this Agreement
pursuant to which the Stockholder shall, among other things, vote in favor of
adopting and approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger in accordance with
the terms hereof and thereof.

     NOW, THEREFORE, to induce Primedex to enter into, and in consideration of
its entering into, the Merger Agreement, and in consideration of the promises
and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties
agree as follows:

     1. Proxy. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Voting Agreement,
Stockholder shall deliver to Primedex a duly executed proxy in the form attached
to this Voting Agreement as Schedule B, which proxy is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by law, with respect to
the Subject Shares referred to therein (the "Proxy").

     2. Restrictions on Shares.

          (a) Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer (except as
may be specifically required by court order or by operation of law), grant an
option with respect to, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or
encumber, the Subject Shares, or make any offer or enter into any agreement
providing for any of the foregoing, at any time from the date of this Agreement
and prior to the date of the Radiologix stockholders meeting at which
Stockholder has voted the Subject Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.


                                       -1-
<PAGE>

          (b) At any time from the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Expiration Date, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action
that would make any representation or warranty contained herein untrue or
incorrect or have the effect of impairing the ability of Stockholder to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or, preventing or delaying the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     3. Representations and Warranties of Stockholder. The Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to Primedex as follows:

          (a) Authority; No Conflict. The Stockholder has all requisite power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder
enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will not,
conflict with, result in any violation of, or constitute (with or without notice
of lapse of time or both) default under, any provision of any material trust
agreement, loan or credit agreement, bond, note, mortgage, indenture, lease,
partnership agreement or other contract, agreement, obligation, commitment,
arrangement, understanding, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license
or any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, notice or
decree applicable to the Stockholder or to any of the Stockholder's property or
assets.

          (b) The Subject Shares. The Stockholder is the sole beneficial owner
of, and has good and marketable title to, the Subject Shares, free and clear of
any Encumbrances whatsoever. The Stockholder does not own, of record or
beneficially, any shares of capital stock of Radiologix other than the Subject
Shares set forth opposite its name on Schedule A attached hereto. The
Stockholder has the sole right to vote such Subject Shares, and none of such
Subject Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or
restriction with respect to the voting of such Subject Shares. The Subject
Shares are and will be at all times through the Expiration Date free and clear
of any Encumbrances of any nature that would adversely affect the Merger or the
fulfillment of the rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement.

     4. Representations and Warranties of Primedex. Primedex hereby represents
and warrants to the Stockholder that Primedex has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Primedex and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Primedex
enforceable against Primedex in accordance with its terms. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict
with, result in any violation of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

of time or both) default under, any provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws of Primedex or any material trust
agreement, loan or credit agreement, bond, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or
other contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license or any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, notice or decree applicable to
Primedex or any of Primedex's property or assets.

     5. Covenants of Stockholder. The Stockholder agrees as follows:

          (a) Without in any way limiting the Stockholder's right to vote the
Subject Shares in its sole discretion on any other matters that may be submitted
to a stockholder vote, consent or other approval (including by written consent),
at any meeting of the stockholders of Radiologix called upon to vote upon the
Merger and the Merger Agreement or at any adjournment thereof or in any other
circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including written
consent) with respect to the Merger and the Merger Agreement is sought, the
Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Shares:

               (i) in favor of the Merger, the approval and adoption of the
               Merger Agreement and approval of the other transactions
               contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any action required in
               furtherance thereof; and

               (ii) against (A) any Acquisition Proposal or any merger agreement
               or merger (other than the Merger and the Merger Agreement),
               consolidation, combination, sale of substantially all of
               Radiologix's assets, sale or issuance of securities of Radiologix
               or its subsidiaries, reorganization, joint venture,
               recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by
               Radiologix or its subsidiaries and (B) as directed by Primedex,
               any amendment of Radiologix's Certificate of Incorporation or
               Bylaws or other proposal or transaction involving Radiologix or
               any of its subsidiaries which amendment or other proposal or
               transaction would or could reasonably be expected to impede,
               frustrate, prevent, nullify or result in a breach of any
               covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
               agreement of Radiologix under or with respect to, the Merger, the
               Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the
               Merger Agreement or by this Agreement.

          (b) The Stockholder shall not directly or indirectly, grant any
proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the Subject Shares, deposit the
Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect
to the Subject Shares.

     6. Consent and Waiver. Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms
of any agreement or instrument to which Stockholder is a party. Without limiting
the generality or effect of the foregoing, Stockholder hereby waives any and all
rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Agreement, Radiologix' Board of Directors' actions in approving and recommending
the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions provided
for in the Merger Agreement, or to seek damages or other legal or equitable
relief in connection therewith. From and after the Effective Time, Stockholder's
right to receive the Merger Consideration on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall constitute Stockholder's sole
and exclusive right against Radiologix and/or Primedex in respect of
Stockholder's ownership of the Subject Shares or status as a Stockholder of
Radiologix or any agreement or instrument with Radiologix pertaining to the
Subject Shares or Stockholder's status as a Stockholder of Radiologix.

     7. Certain Events. The Stockholder agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to
the Subject Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to which legal
or beneficial ownership of such Subject Shares shall pass, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, including the Stockholder's successors. In the event of any
stock split, stock dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other
change in the capital structure of Radiologix affecting Radiologix Common Stock,
or the acquisition of additional shares of Radiologix Common Stock or other
voting securities of Radiologix by the Stockholder (whether by purchase,
conversion or otherwise), the number of Subject Shares listed in Schedule A
beside the name of the Stockholder shall be adjusted appropriately and this
Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional or
decreased shares of Radiologix Common Stock or other voting securities of
Radiologix issued to or acquired or disposed of by the Stockholder, and such
shares shall be treated as "Subject Shares" for all purposes of this Agreement.

     8. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by the Stockholder, on the one hand,
without the prior written consent of Primedex nor by Primedex, on the other
hand, without the prior written consent of the Stockholder, except that Primedex
may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Primedex. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

     9. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate, and the provisions hereof
shall be of no further force or effect, upon the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time, (ii) November 30, 2006 and (iii) the valid termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms (the "Expiration Date").

     10. Appraisal Rights. Stockholder agrees not to exercise any rights of
appraisal or dissenters' rights that Stockholder may have (whether under
applicable law or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in connection
with the Merger.

     11. General Provisions.

Section or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

(including, without limitation, the Proxy) (i) constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or

deliver a copy of this Agreement to Radiologix and hereby agrees that each of
Primedex and Radiologix may rely upon such delivery as conclusively evidencing
the waivers of Stockholder set forth herein.

     12. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other

     13. Public Announcements. Except as required by law, the Stockholder shall
not issue any press release or other public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement without the
prior written consent of Primedex. Stockholder acknowledges that Radiologix and
Primedex intend to publicly disclose the Merger and this Agreement upon
execution by Primedex and Radiologix of the Merger Agreement; provided, however,
that Stockholder shall be entitled to review and reasonably approve any use of
its name in any press release issued by Primedex or Radiologix in connection
with the transaction.

     14. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the fullest extent possible, the original intent of the parties.

     The undersigned stockholder of Radiologix, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent permitted by law)
appoints and constitutes the members of the Board of Directors of Primedex
Health Systems, Inc., a New York corporation ("Primedex"), and each of them, the
attorneys and proxies of the undersigned with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to
(i) all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company owned beneficially by
the undersigned as of the date of this proxy, which shares are specified on
Schedule A to the Voting Agreement (as hereinafter defined), and (ii) any and
all other shares of capital stock of the Company which the undersigned may
acquire on or after the date hereof and which are Subject Shares (as defined in
the Voting Agreement). (The shares of the capital stock of the Company referred
to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence are
collectively referred to as the "Shares.") Upon the execution hereof, all prior
proxies given by the undersigned with respect to any of the Shares are hereby
revoked, and the undersigned agrees that no subsequent proxies will be given
with respect to any of the Shares, nor will the undersigned enter into any
agreement or understanding with any Person (as defined in the Merger Agreement
(defined below)) to vote or give instructions with respect to the Shares in any
manner inconsistent with the terms of this Irrevocable Proxy until after the
Expiration Date (as defined below).

     Until the Expiration Date, this proxy is irrevocable (to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law), is coupled with an interest and is granted as
required by the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between Primedex
and the undersigned (the "Voting Agreement"), and is granted in consideration of
Primedex entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, among Primedex, Radnet Management, Inc., PR Acquisition Corporation and
the Company as the same may be amended or supplemented (the "Merger Agreement").

     The attorney and proxy named above will be empowered, and may exercise this
proxy, to vote the Shares at any time until the earlier to occur of (i) the
valid termination of the Merger Agreement, (ii) November 30, 2006 and (iii) the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "Expiration Date") at
every meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, and in
connection with any solicitation of written consents from stockholders of the
Company:

          (a) in favor of the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the
          approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
          other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any action
          required in furtherance thereof; and

          (b) against (A) any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger
          Agreement) or any merger agreement or merger (other than the Merger


                                      -9-

          and the Merger Agreement), consolidation, combination, sale of
          substantially all of the Company's assets, sale or issuance of
          securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, reorganization, joint
          venture, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
          or by the Company or its subsidiaries and (B) as directed by Primedex,
          any amendment of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
          or other proposal or transaction involving the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries which amendment or other proposal or transaction would or
          could reasonably be expected to impede, frustrate, prevent, nullify or
          result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
          other obligation or agreement of the Company under or with respect to,
          the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions
          contemplated by the Merger Agreement or by this Agreement.

     This proxy shall be binding upon any person or entity to which legal or
beneficial ownership of the Subject Shares shall pass, whether by operation of
law or otherwise, including the Stockholder's successors.

     If any provision of this proxy or any part of any such provision is held
under any circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then
(a) such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such circumstances and
in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as to
be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible extent, (b) the invalidity or
unenforceability of such provision or part under such circumstances and in such
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision
or part thereof under any other circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, and
(c) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or
the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this proxy. Each
provision of this proxy is separable from every other provision of this proxy,
and each part of each provision of this proxy is separable from every other part
of such provision.

shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless or except to the
extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a
separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of

     At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled to vote may
vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a
transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established
for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph
may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for
any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be
used provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction
shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

     All voting, including on the election of directors but excepting where
otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon
demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or by his or her proxy, a
stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of
which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other
information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law, shall, in advance of any
meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting
and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person
presiding at the meeting may, and to the extent required by law, shall, appoint
one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering
upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his ability. Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by an
inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting.

     All elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and
except as otherwise required by law, all other matters shall be determined by a
majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.

     Section 8: Stock List.

     A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing
the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in his
or her name, shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of
at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city

the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be
held.

     The stock list shall also be kept at the place of the meeting during the

who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by

     Section 9: Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting.

     Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual
or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by
delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested.

     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder
who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the
corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date
the earliest dated consent is delivered to the Corporation, a written consent or
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered
to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in the first paragraph of this


                                      -3-

Section. A telegram, cablegram, electronic mail or other electronic transmission
consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or
proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or
proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of
this Section to the extent permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered
in accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the Delaware General Corporate Law.

     Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing
may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy,
facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
original writing.

     The number of directors who shall constitute the whole Board shall be such
number as the Board of Directors or stockholders shall from time to time have
designated, except that in the absence of any such designation, such number
shall be one (1). Each director shall be elected for a term of one year and
until his or her successor is elected and qualified, except as otherwise
provided herein or required by law.

     Whenever the authorized number of directors is increased between annual
meetings of the stockholders, a majority of the directors then in office shall
have the power to elect such new directors for the balance of a term and until
their successors are elected and qualified. Any decrease in the authorized
number of directors shall not become effective until the expiration of the term
of the directors then in office unless, at the time of such decrease, there
shall be vacancies on the board which are being eliminated by the decrease.

     Section 2: Vacancies.

     If the office of any director becomes vacant by reason of death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause, a majority of the
directors remaining in office, although less than a quorum, may elect a
successor for the unexpired term and until his or her successor is elected and
qualified.

     Section 3: Regular Meetings.

     Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place or
places, on such date or dates, and at such time or times as shall have been

at such time as they or he or she shall fix. Notice of the place, date, and time
of each such special meeting shall be given each director by whom it is not
waived by mailing written notice not less than five (5) days before the meeting

     Section 5: Quorum.

     At any meeting of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of
the whole Board shall constitute a quorum for all purposes. If a quorum shall

to another place, date, or time, without further notice or waiver thereof.

     Section 6: Participation in Meetings By Conference Telephone.

     Members of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may
participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other and such participation shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

     Section 7: Conduct of Business.

     At any meeting of the Board of Directors, business shall be transacted in
such order and manner as the Board may from time to time determine, and all
matters shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the directors present,
except as otherwise provided herein or required by law. Action may be taken by
the Board of Directors without a meeting if all members thereof consent thereto
in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors.

     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board
of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the
minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the
minutes are maintained in electronic form.

     Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing
may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all

may be taken by any committee without a meeting K all members thereof consent
thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of
the proceedings of such committee.

                                      STOCK

     Section 1: Certificates of Stock.

     Each stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate signed by, or in the
name of the Corporation by, the President or a Vice President, and by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer,
certifying the number of shares owned by him or her. Any or all of the

     Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the
Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer agents
designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Except where a
certificate is issued in accordance with Section 4 of Article V of these
By-laws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved shall be
surrendered for cancellation before a new certificate is issued therefor.

     Section 3: Record Date.

     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any meeting of
stockholders, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the time for such other
action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or,
if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held, and, for determining stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or
to exercise any rights of change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any
other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.

     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors
may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which record date shall be not more than ten (10) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors and no prior action by the Board of Directors is


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the record date shall be the
first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or
proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by
Article 1, Section 9 hereof. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Delaware
General Corporation Law with respect to the proposed action by written consent
of the stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

     Section 4: Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

     In the event of the loss, theft or destruction of any certificate of stock,
another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board of
Directors may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft or destruction and
concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.

     Section 5: Regulations.

     The issue, transfer, conversion and registration of certificates of stock
shall be governed by such other regulations as the Board of Directors may
establish.

     Section 1: Notices.

     Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or required by law, all
notices required to be given to any stockholder, director, officer, employee or
agent shall be in writing and may in every instance be effectively given by hand
delivery to the recipient thereof, by depositing such notice in the mails,
postage paid, or by sending such notice by prepaid telegram or mailgram. Any
such notice shall be addressed to such stockholder, director, officer, employee
or agent at his or her last known address as the same appears on the books of
the Corporation. The time when such notice is received, if hand delivered, or
dispatched, if delivered through the mails or by telegram or mailgram, shall be
the time of the giving of the notice.

     Section 2: Waivers.

     A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder, director, officer,
employee or agent, whether before or after the time of the event for which
notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be
given to such stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent. Neither the
business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

the Corporation, which seal shall be in the charge of the Secretary. If and when
so directed by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, duplicates of the
seal may be kept and used by the Treasurer or by an Assistant Secretary or
Assistant Treasurer.

     Section 3: Reliance upon Books, Reports and Records.

     Each director, each member of any committee designated by the Board of
Directors, and each officer of the Corporation shall, in the performance of his
or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the books of
account or other records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions,
reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or
employees, or committees of the Board of Directors so designated, or by any
other person as to matters which such director or committee member reasonably
believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and
who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation.

     Section 4: Fiscal Year.

     The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be as fixed by the Board of
Directors.

     Section 5: Time Periods.

     In applying any provision of these By-laws which requires that an act be

be done during a period of a specified number of days prior to an event,
calendar days shall be used, the day of the doing of the act shall be excluded,

                INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES

                                AND OTHER AGENTS

     Section 1: Indemnification Of Directors And Officers.

     The Corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by
the General Corporation Law of Delaware, indemnify each of its directors and
officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection
with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an
agent of the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1, a "director" or
"officer" of the Corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a director or officer of a
corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another
enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

     Section 2: Indemnification Of Others.

     The Corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the
manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each
of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the Corporation. For
purposes of this Section 2, an "employee" or "agent" of the Corporation (other
than a director or officer) includes any person (a) who is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was an employee or agent of a
corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another
enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

     Section 3: Payment Of Expenses In Advance.

     Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which
indemnification is required pursuant to Section 1 of this Article VIII or for
which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 2 of this Article VIII
following authorization thereof by the Board of Directors shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal that the indemnified party is not
entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VIII.


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     Section 4: Indemnity Not Exclusive.

     The indemnification provided by this Article VIII shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, to the extent that such
additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of
incorporation

     Section 5: Insurance.

     The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her
against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware.

     Section 6: Conflicts.

     No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article VIII, except
where such indemnification or advance is mandated by law or the order, judgment
or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it
appears:

     (a) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of
incorporation, these Bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders or an agreement in
effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in
the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

     (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a
court in approving a settlement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   AMENDMENTS

     These Bylaws may be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors at any
meeting or by the stockholders at any meeting.

[Date]

Primedex Health Systems, Inc.
1510 Cotner Avenue
Los Angeles, CA 90025

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned, a holder of shares of Common Stock of Radiologix, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is entitled to receive in exchange for any
such shares, in connection with the merger (the "Merger") of PR Acquisition
Corporation., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Radnet
Management, Inc., a California corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Primedex Health Systems, Inc., a New York corporation ("Parent"), with and
into the Company, shares of Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). The
undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of
the Company as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 145 ("Rule 145")
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").

     If in fact the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company under the Act,
the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent Common Stock
received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such
transaction is registered under the Act or an exemption from such registration
is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and
the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature
and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the
applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated
under the Act.

     The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned will not sell, pledge, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of the Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger
except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act, (ii)
in conformity with the volume and other applicable limitations of Rules 144 and
145 promulgated under the Act or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or
interpretive letter from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
not required to be registered under the Act. The undersigned understands that
Parent has no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of
the Parent Common Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigned's behalf or to
take any other action necessary to make compliance with an exemption from
registration available.

<PAGE>

     In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger pursuant to Rule 145, the
undersigned will supply Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
of compliance with Rule 145. The undersigned understands that Parent may
instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of shares of Parent Common
Stock sold or disposed of by the undersigned, subject to receipt of such
evidence of compliance. Following such receipt, Parent shall instruct the
transfer agent to effectuate the transfer of the Parent Common Stock sold or
disposed of by the undersigned.

     Parent covenants that it will take all such actions as may be reasonably
available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of Parent
Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145 in accordance with the terms
thereof.

     The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that there will be placed on
certificates representing Parent Common Stock (or on confirmations and account
statements for shares of Parent Common Stock held in book-entry form) received
by the undersigned in the Merger or held by a transferee thereof a legend in
substantially the following form:

          "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE
          BEEN ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145
          PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
          AMENDED, APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE
          TRANSFERRED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE
          145 OR PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THAT
          ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION."

     The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend and stop orders set
forth above will be removed (i) upon receipt of evidence or representations
satisfactory to Parent that the Parent Common Stock represented by such
certificates are being or have been sold in a transaction made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145 (as such rule may be hereafter amended) or if
such certificates are being or have been sold in a transfer registered under the
Act or (ii) upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent from counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the
effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the Act.

     The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of securities and
(ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement and a condition to
Parent's obligations to consummate the Merger.

                                        Very truly yours,
