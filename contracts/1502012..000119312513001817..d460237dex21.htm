2.4 _Effective Time_.

(a) Subject to this Section 2.4, the purchase and sale of the Assets shall be
effective as of December 28, 2012 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or
attributable to the Leases, Units and Wells at and after the Effective Time
(and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at or after
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, delay rentals, shut-
in royalties, and lease bonuses, and shall be responsible for (and entitled
to any refunds and indemnities with respect to) all Property Costs incurred at
and after the Effective Time. Except as set forth to the contrary herein,
Sellers shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable
to Leases, Units and Wells prior to the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time,
and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time. The terms "earned" and
"incurred", as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and Counsel of Petroleum
Accountants Societies standards. For purposes of this Section 2.4,
determination of whether Property Costs are attributable to the period before
or after the Effective Time shall be based on when services are rendered, when
the goods are delivered, or when the work is performed. For clarification, the
date an item or work is ordered is not the date of a pre-Effective
Time transaction for settlement purposes, but rather the date on which the
item ordered is delivered to the job site, or the date on which the work
ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date. For purposes of allocating
Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto
including royalties and overriding royalties payable to the owner of the
Assets), under this Section 2.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be
"from or attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through
the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run,
or, if there is no such facility, the applicable LACT meters through which
they are run, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are
transported. Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to
arrive at an allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or
gauging and strapping data is not available. Sellers shall provide to
Purchaser, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, all
data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of
establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 12.2
that will be used to determine the Closing settlement to be made pursuant to
Section 12.2. Taxes shall be allocated and prorated in the manner set forth
in Section 9.3. Right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs
that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in
the applicable period falling before, and the number of days in the
applicable period falling at or after, the Effective Time. In each case,
Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period at and
after the Effective 

 



13  Time and Sellers shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the
period before the Effective Time. After Closing, each Party shall be entitled
to participate in all joint interest audits and other audits of Property
Costs for which such Party is responsible or revenues to which such Party is
entitled (whether entirely or in part) pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) or
Section 12.2. All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this Section
2.4(b) and Section 12.2 shall be without duplication of any other amounts paid
or received under this Agreement.

2.5 _Maintenance of Records_. Purchaser, or its successors or assigns, for a
period of seven (7) years following Closing, will (a) retain the Records, (b)
provide each Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees
and representatives with access to the Records during normal business hours
for review and copying at such Sellers sole cost and expense, and (c) provide
such Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees and
representatives with access, during normal business hours, access, at such
Sellers sole cost, risk and expense, to materials received or produced after
Closing relating to any Indemnity Claim made under Section 14.6 of this
Agreement for review and copying.

ARTICLE 3

 

PURCHASE PRICE

3.1 _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the conveyance of the Assets to
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers at Closing the Cash
Consideration and evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, of the
Assumption Consideration (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "), adjusted in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. On or before a date that is five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a
proposed allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets,
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar provision of state or local law, as appropriate). Thereafter, prior
to the Closing, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to agree upon the final
schedule setting forth such allocation (as finalized, the " _Allocation
Schedule_ "). If Purchaser and Sellers are unable to resolve any dispute as
to the Allocation Schedule, such dispute shall be resolved promptly in the
manner provided for disputes as to Purchase Price adjustments under Section
12.3(c). The " _Allocated Value_ " for any Asset equals the portion of the
unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on the Allocation Schedule,
as adjusted in the manner contemplated in Section 12.2. Any adjustments to the
Purchase Price allocable to the Assets other than the adjustments provided
for in Sections 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 shall be applied on a pro-rata basis to the
amounts set forth on the Allocation Schedule for all Assets. After all such
adjustments are made, any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Sections 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 shall be applied to the amounts set forth in the
Allocation Schedule for the particular affected Assets. The Parties have
accepted such Allocated Values (as adjusted in the manner contemplated above
in this Section 3.2) for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, but otherwise make no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy of such values. Sellers and Purchaser agree (a) that the
Allocated Values shall be used by the Sellers and Purchaser as the basis for
reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and
local tax returns, including without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, and (b) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take
positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values in notices to government
authorities or in

 



14  audit or other proceedings with respect to taxes. Sellers and Purchaser
further agree that the portion of Allocated Values included in _the Allocation
Schedule_ attributable to tangible personal property shall equal the fair
value of such property on the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 4

 

THE PURCHASERS INSPECTION

4.1 _Access to Background Materials_. Prior to Closing, and subject to Section
4.3, Sellers will make the Background Materials (as defined in Section 7.10)
and the Records available to Purchaser and its representatives for inspection
and review at Sellers offices during normal business hours to permit
Purchaser to perform its due diligence review. Subject to the consent and
cooperation of third Persons, Sellers will assist Purchaser in Purchasers
efforts to obtain, at Purchasers expense, such additional information from
such Persons as Purchaser may reasonably desire. Purchaser may inspect the
Background Materials and such additional information only to the extent it
may do so without violating any obligation of confidence or contractual
commitment of Sellers to third Persons. If disclosure or access is prohibited,
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission
to grant such access to Purchaser and its representatives, and shall provide
Purchaser with as much information or access concerning the matter as is
possible while still complying with applicable Laws and Sellers obligations;
provided that Sellers shall not be required to make any payments for the
benefit of any third Person in order to do so.

4.2  _Disclaimer_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, Sellers make no warranty or representation of any kind as to
the Background Materials or any information contained therein. Purchaser
agrees that any conclusions drawn from the Background Materials shall be the
result of its own independent review and judgment.

4.3  _Physical Access to the Leases and Wells_. During reasonable business
hours, Sellers agree to grant Purchaser physical access to the Properties to
allow Purchaser to conduct, at Purchasers sole risk and expense, on site
inspections and environmental assessments of the Properties. In connection
with any such on site inspections, Purchaser agrees not to unreasonably and
materially interfere with the normal operation of the Properties and agrees to
comply with all requirements of the operators of the Wells. If Purchaser or
its agents prepares an environmental assessment of any Lease or Well,
Purchaser agrees to keep such assessment confidential, unless disclosure is
required pursuant to applicable Law, and to furnish copies thereof to
Sellers. IN CONNECTION WITH GRANTING SUCH ACCESS, PURCHASER REPRESENTS THAT IT
IS ADEQUATELY INSURED AND WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES TO INDEMNIFY SELLERS,
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, LIMITED
PARTNERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES AND AFFILIATES
AGAINST ALL CLAIMS FOR INJURY TO, OR DEATH OF, PERSONS OR FOR DAMAGE TO
PROPERTY ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO PURCHASER HEREUNDER OR
THE ACTIVITIES OF PURCHASER, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OF ANY SELLER AND ITS CONTRACTORS AND
SUBCONTRACTORS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES, BUT EXCLUDING HOWEVER, THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL 

 



15  MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH PERSON. THIS WAIVER, RELEASE AND INDEMNITY BY
PURCHASER SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

ARTICLE 5

 

TITLE MATTERS

5.1 _Examination Period_. Following the execution date of this Agreement until
5:00 p.m., local time in Houston, Texas on the date five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Examination Period_ "), Sellers shall
permit Purchaser and its representatives to examine, at all reasonable times,
in the offices of Sellers, in Houston, Texas, all abstracts of title, title
opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files, contract files,
assignments, division orders, operating and accounting records and other
records and agreements pertaining to the Assets insofar as same may now be in
existence and in the possession of Sellers or their respective Affiliates,
subject to such restrictions on disclosure as may exist under confidentiality
agreements or other agreements binding on Sellers or such data; _provided,
however_ , that if disclosure or access is prohibited, Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission to grant such access
to Purchaser and its representatives, and shall provide Purchaser with as much
information or access concerning the matter as is possible while still
complying with applicable Laws and Sellers obligations; provided that
Sellers shall not be required to make any payments for the benefit of any
third Person in order to do so.

5.2 _Title Defect_. The term " _Title Defect_ ," as used in this Agreement,
means: (a) any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, or defect in any
Sellers ownership of any Asset (expressly excluding Permitted Encumbrances)
that causes Sellers (collectively) not to have Defensible Title to such Asset;
or (b) any default by any Seller under a lease, farmout agreement or other
contract or agreement that would (i) have a material adverse affect on the
operation, value or use of such Asset, (ii) prevent any applicable Seller from
receiving the proceeds of production attributable to such Sellers interest
therein; or (iii) result in cancellation of such Sellers interest therein.

5.3 _Notice of Title Defects_. In order to make a claim for a Title Defect
pursuant to this Article 5, Purchaser must notify Sellers of such Title Defect
on or before the expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective, such
notice must (a) be in writing, (b) include a description of the Title Defect,
(c) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title Defect, (d)
attach such supporting documentation as is in the possession of Purchaser, and
(f) include the value of such Title Defect as determined by Purchaser;
_provided, however_ , an alleged failure to comply with subsections (a)
through (f) shall not cause such notice to be invalid or any Title Defect to
be waived in any respect if the defect notice is reasonably sufficient
to provide notice to Sellers of the existence and general nature of the
alleged Title Defect. Without limiting the representations and warranties of
Sellers set forth in Article 7 (or the certificates to be delivered by Sellers
at Closing pursuant to Section 12.4(e)), the special warranties of Sellers
set forth in Section 5.5(e) and the Conveyance, or the indemnifications of
Sellers in Article 14 with respect thereto, any matters that may otherwise
constitute Title Defects, but of which Sellers have not been specifically
notified by Purchaser in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to
have been waived by Purchaser.

 



16 5.4 _Title Defect Value Determination_. The value attributable to each
Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Value_ ") that is asserted by Purchaser in
the Title Defect notices shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth
below:

(a) If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect Value is
the amount necessary to be paid to unconditionally remove the lien from the
affected Asset.

 

(b) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable
to any Property is less than that stated in  _Exhibit B_ or the Working
Interest attributable to any Well or Unit is greater than that stated in
_Exhibit B_, then the Title Defect Value shall take into account the relative
change in the interest from _Exhibit B_ and the appropriate Allocated Value
attributed to such Asset. If the Title Defect asserted is that the NRI
attributable to any Property is less than the NRI set forth on _Exhibit B_,
then the Title Defect Value is the product of the Allocated Value of the
relevant Property, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
difference between such NRI set forth in _Exhibit B_ and the actual NRI, and
the denominator of which is such NRI set forth in  _Exhibit B_.

(c) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in WI for which there
is not a proportionate increase in NRI) for which the economic detriment to
Purchaser is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset,
the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect
over the life of the affected Asset, and the Title Defect Values placed upon
the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers, and such other facts as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(d) If a Title Defect does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the
entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken into account in
determining the Title Defect Value.

 

(e) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a Title
Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells or Units or other Assets
affected thereby.

5.5 _Remedies for Title Defects_. 

(a) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on a resolution with respect
to any Title Defect prior to Closing. Sellers may, at their collective
option, attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time prior to Closing. If
such Title Defect has not been cured at or prior to Closing (or the Parties
cannot agree upon whether or to what extent the Title Defect has been
so cured), the applicable Asset shall be conveyed at Closing, subject to all
uncured Title Defects, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Purchasers
estimate of the Title Defect Value attributable to each applicable Title
Defect, subject, however, to Section 5.5(d), and Sellers shall have the right
to elect to have the unresolved matter resolved by an independent expert
pursuant to Section 5.10.

 



17 (b) If any Title Defect is in the nature of (i) an unobtained consent to
assignment which causes the assignment to be null or void, or (ii) a
restriction on assignability, in each case, subject to Section 9.2(d), the
affected Asset shall be excluded from the assignment at Closing and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value attributable to such
Asset.

(c) If on or before Closing the Parties have not agreed upon the validity
of any asserted Title Defect or have not agreed on the Title Defect Value
attributable thereto, either Party shall have the right to elect to have the
validity of such Title Defect or such Title Defect Value determined by an
independent expert pursuant to Section 5.10.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the
value of a given individual Title Defect does not exceed $20,000, then no
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Defect, (ii) if
the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with
this Agreement for Title Defects (exceeding $20,000) less Title Benefits
(exceeding $20,000) plus Casualty Loss and plus Environmental Defect Amounts
(exceeding $20,000) does not exceed two per cent (2%) of the Purchase Price
prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price
shall be made therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase
Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects
(exceeding $20,000) less Title Benefits (exceeding $20,000) plus Casualty
Loss and plus Environmental Defect Amounts (exceeding $20,000) does exceed two
per cent (2%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the
Purchase Price shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess. 

(e) Sellers hereby agree to warrant and defend title to the Assets (and
provide such warranty in the conveyance of the Assets provided to Purchaser
at Closing) unto Purchaser, its successors and assigns, against every person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof, by,
through or under Sellers, but not otherwise; subject, however, to
the Permitted Encumbrances and the other matters set forth herein. Each
Seller hereby assigns to Purchaser all rights, claims, and causes of action on
title covenants and warranties given or made by such Sellers predecessors
(other than Affiliates of such Seller), and Purchaser is specifically
subrogated to all rights which such Seller may have against its predecessors
(other than Affiliates of such Seller), to the extent that such Seller may
legally transfer such rights and grant such subrogation. Claims by Purchaser
under the special warranty of title shall not be subject to the thresholds or
deductibles set forth in Section 5.5(d) and shall not be deemed to constitute
Assumed Obligations.

 

5.6 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

(a) If Sellers discover any Title Benefit during the Examination Period
affecting the Assets, Sellers may notify the other Party in writing thereof on
or before the expiration of the Examination Period. Such notice shall be
similar to the notice of Title Defects to be provided by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 5.3, _mutatis mutandis_. Subject to Section 5.5, Sellers shall be
entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
12.2 with respect to all Title Benefits, in an amount agreed upon by the
Parties; _provided, however_ , that if the aggregate upward adjustment to the
Purchase Price determined in accordance with Section 5.5(d) does not exceed
two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments

 



18  thereto, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for Title
Benefits, and, if the aggregate upward adjustment to the Purchase Price
determined in accordance with Section 5.5(d) does exceed two percent (2%) of
the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price
shall only be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " means Sellers interest in any
Property listed on _Exhibit B_ that is greater than or in addition to that
set forth in _Exhibit B_ (including, without limitation, an NRI that is
greater than that set forth in  _Exhibit B_) or Sellers WI in any Asset
that is less than the WI set forth in _Exhibit B_ (without a corresponding
decrease in the NRI). Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title
Benefits, but of which Purchaser has not been specifically notified by
Sellers in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived
by Sellers for all purposes.

(b) The value of a Title Benefit shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected
by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
discounted economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the affected
Asset, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Sellers,
whether and to what extent the applicable instruments giving rise to
the Title Benefit are filed in the records of any applicable Governmental
Authority and would constitute notice to third Persons of the existence
thereof under applicable Law, and such other facts as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation. If a Title Benefit does not benefit an Asset throughout
the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken into
account in determining the value of the Title Benefit. The value of a Title
Benefit shall be determined without duplication of any amounts included in
the value of another Title Benefit.

(c) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on a resolution with respect
to any Title Benefit prior to Closing. If the Parties cannot agree upon any
Title Benefit, or the value thereof, prior to Closing, the applicable Asset
shall be conveyed at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be increased
by Purchasers estimate of the value, if any, attributable to each Title
Benefit, subject, however, to Section 5.6(a), and either Party shall have the
right to elect to have the validity of such Title Benefit or the value thereof
determined by an independent expert pursuant to Section 5.10.

5.7 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 

(a) Subject to the further terms of this Agreement, including the
representations and warranties of Sellers made in Article 7, and the
certificate to be delivered by each Seller pursuant to Section 12.4(e),
Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the
condition of, the Assets from the Effective Time until Closing for production
of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including, but not limited to, the
watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well)
and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Sections 10.5 and 10.6, if, after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is
destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right
of eminent domain (" _Casualty Loss_ "), and the loss as a result of such
Casualty Loss individually or in the aggregate exceeds two percent (2%) of
the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close, and
Sellers shall

 



19  elect, by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing, either (i) to cause
the Assets affected by any Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at
least their condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost,
risk and expense, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend
after the Closing Date), or (ii) to indemnify Purchaser in a manner reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser against any costs, losses, or expenses that Purchaser
reasonably incurs to repair the Assets subject to any Casualty Loss. In each
case, Sellers shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against
third Persons with respect to the Casualty Loss, except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing.

(c) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets experiences a Casualty Loss, and the loss as a result of
such Casualty Loss individually or in the aggregate is two percent (2%) or
less of the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close
and Sellers shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Sellers by
third Persons by reason of such Casualty Loss and shall assign, transfer and
set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of Sellers right, title
and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights
against third Persons (other than Affiliates of any Seller, other than captive
insurance Affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, employees and
agents) arising out of the Casualty Loss.

5.8 _Limitations on Applicability_. The right of Purchaser to assert a Title
Defect and the Sellers to assert Title Benefits under this Article 5 shall
terminate as of the Examination Period; provided there shall be no termination
of Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section 5.5 with respect to any bona
fide Title Defect properly reported in a Title Defect notice or bona fide
Title Benefit claim properly reported in a Title Benefit notice on or before
the end of the Examination Period. Thereafter, except as to Sellers title
representation in Section 5.5(e), and the further terms of this Agreement,
including the representations and warranties of Sellers made in Article 7, and
the certificate to be delivered by each Seller pursuant to Section 12.4(e) in
respect thereof, Purchasers sole and exclusive rights and remedies with
regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in, and arise under, the
Conveyance transferring the Assets from Sellers to Purchaser.

 

5.9 _Governmental Approvals Respecting Assets_.

(a) Purchaser, within thirty (30) days after Closing, shall file for approval
with the applicable Governmental Authorities all assignment documents,
designation or change of operator documents and other state and federal
transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of the Assets and the
operatorship thereof, where applicable. Purchaser and Sellers further agree
promptly after Closing to take all other actions reasonably required of them
by Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite
regulatory approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the approval by such
Governmental Authorities, of Sellers assignment documents requiring approval
of such Governmental Authorities in order for Purchaser to be recognized by
the federal or state agencies as the owner, or, where applicable operator of
the Assets.

 

(b) Until all of the governmental approvals provided for in Section 5.9(a)
have been obtained, the following shall occur with respect to the affected
portion of the Assets:

 



20 (i) Sellers shall continue to hold record title to the affected Assets as
nominee for Purchaser;

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Assumed Obligations with respect
to the affected Leases and other affected portions of the Assets as if
Purchaser was the record owner of such Assets as of the Effective Time; and

(iii) Sellers shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall be authorized to act
only upon and in accordance with Purchasers written instructions, and Sellers
shall have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the Assets other than those which arise as a result
of an emergency where the failure to act may result in injury or damage to
Persons or Assets or are purely administrative or ministerial in nature,
unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser.

(c) If a Governmental Authority fails to grant approval within twenty-
four (24) months after Purchaser has filed for approval, Sellers may continue
to hold record title to the affected Properties and other affected Assets as
Purchasers nominee or, at Sellers sole option, they may terminate this
Agreement and all of their obligations hereunder as to the affected Assets by
giving sixty (60) days written notice to Purchaser. Upon such termination: (i)
this Agreement shall be null and void and terminated only as to the affected
Assets, (ii) Purchaser shall immediately re-convey and return to Sellers the
conveyance documents and any and all other documents, materials and data
previously delivered to Purchaser with respect to the Assets, and (iii)
Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the Allocated Value of the affected Asset with
adjustments thereto calculated in accordance with Section 12.2, without
interest, attributable to the affected Assets from the Effective Time until
such Assets are re-conveyed to Sellers. 

5.10 _Independent Expert_. Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing. If Sellers
and Purchaser are unable to agree by Closing, Purchasers estimate shall
control for the purposes of Closing pursuant to Section 12.3, and the Title
Defect Values and the value of any Title Benefits in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 5.10.
There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in
the regional area in which the applicable Assets are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Sellers and Purchaser within two (2) Business Days after
Closing, and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "); _provided, however_ , if
the Parties have not agreed upon a Person to serve as Title Arbitrator within
such two (2) Business Day period, and Sellers or Purchaser have not, within
five (5) Business Days thereafter, formally applied to the Houston office of
the American Arbitration Association to choose the Title Arbitrator, Sellers
shall be deemed to have waived their dispute of any applicable Title Defect
Values and the values of any Title Benefits. The arbitration proceeding shall
be held in Harris County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title 

 



21  Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.
Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested
third Persons to advise the arbitrator, including, without limitation,
petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Values and
Title Benefit values submitted by either Purchaser or Sellers and shall not
be empowered to award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with
respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case and indemnify and hold harmless
the other Parties with respect thereto. Sellers (collectively) and Purchaser
(individually) shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are
attributable to such third Person consultation. Within ten (10) days after
the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Sellers and Purchaser of his
award with respect to a Title Defect Value or a Title Benefit value, (a)
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Arbitrator to Sellers, and (b) Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount, if
any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Purchaser.

ARTICLE 6

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

6.1 _Assessment_.

(a) Upon notice to Sellers and subject to Section 6.1(b), Purchaser shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.6, have the right to conduct an
environmental assessment of all or any portion of the Assets (the "
_Assessment_ ") to be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or
engineering firm (the " _Environmental Consultant_ "). The Assessment shall be
conducted at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to
the indemnity provisions of Section 6.6. Prior to conducting any sampling,
boring, drilling or other invasive investigative activity with respect to the
Assets (" _Invasive Activity_ "), Purchaser shall furnish for Sellers review
a proposed scope of such Invasive Activity, including a description of the
activities to be conducted and a description of the approximate locations of
such activities. Sellers may, in their sole and absolute discretion, refuse
to permit any Invasive Activity, in which event the affected Asset, at the
option of Purchaser, shall be removed from the Assets and the Purchase Price
reduced by the Allocated Value thereof. In addition, if any of the
proposed activities may unreasonably interfere with normal operation of the
Assets, Sellers may request a reasonable modification of the proposed Invasive
Activity. Sellers shall have the right to be present during any Assessment of
the Assets and shall have the right, at their option and expense, to split
samples with Purchaser. After completing any Assessment of the Assets,
Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense, restore the Assets to their
condition prior to the commencement of such Assessment (unless Sellers
request otherwise) and shall promptly and properly dispose of all drill
cuttings, corings, or other investigative-derived wastes generated in the
course of the Assessment. Purchaser shall maintain, and shall cause its
officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents and advisors to
maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Assessment or
other due diligence activity as strictly confidential until the Closing occurs
(or in perpetuity, in the event that Closing does not occur), unless
disclosure of any facts as a result of such Assessment is required under any
applicable Laws (including Environmental Laws or Laws requiring disclosure of
reasons for the termination of this Agreement in the event that Closing does
not occur). Purchaser shall provide Sellers with one copy of the final product
of all environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser

 



22  with respect to any Assessment or Invasive Activity conducted on the Assets.
In the event that any necessary disclosures under applicable Environmental
Laws are required with respect to matters discovered by any Assessment
conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that Sellers
shall be the responsible Parties for disclosing such matters to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities.

 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that the permission of the operator (if other than
a Seller or its Affiliate) or another third Person may be required before
Purchaser will be able to conduct an Assessment and that such permission may
not be obtained. Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such
permission for Purchaser. All inspections pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall
be at Purchasers sole risk, cost, and expense. Purchaser agrees to comply
with the rules, regulations and instructions issued by Sellers and other
operators of the Assets regarding the actions of Purchaser while upon,
entering, or leaving the Assets.

6.2 _Notice of Environmental Defects_. In order to make a claim for an
Environmental Defect pursuant to this Article 6, Purchaser must notify
Sellers of such Environmental Defect on or before the expiration of the
Examination Period. To be effective, such claim must (a) be in writing, (b)
include a description of the Environmental Defect in sufficient detail to
allow Sellers to assess the existence, nature and economic significance of the
Environmental Defect, (c) identify the specific Asset affected by such
Environmental Defect, (d) attach such supporting documentation as is in the
possession of Purchaser, and (e) include the value of such Environmental
Defect as determined by Purchaser; _provided, however_ , an alleged failure to
comply with subsections (a) through (e) shall not cause such notice to be
invalid or any Environmental Defect to be waived in any respect if the defect
notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to Sellers of the existence
and general nature of the alleged Environmental Defect. Without limiting the
representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Article 7 (or the
certificates to be delivered by Sellers at Closing pursuant to Section 12.4)
or the indemnifications of Sellers in Article 14 with respect thereto, any
matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but for which
Purchaser has not asserted a claim in accordance with the foregoing, and which
are specifically described in the report generated by the Environmental
Consultant shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser.

6.3 _Environmental Defect Value Determination_. The value attributable to
each Environmental Defect (the " _Environmental Defect Value_ ") that is
asserted by Purchaser in the Environmental Defect notices shall be determined
based upon the criteria set forth below:

 

(a) If Purchaser and Sellers agree on the value of the Environmental Defect,
that amount shall be the Environmental Defect Value. 

(b) The Environmental Defect Value shall include the amount required to remove
or remediate the Environmental Defect and otherwise rehabilitate or restore
the affected Asset, such that it is in compliance with Environmental Laws,
together with any fines, penalties, fees, damages, losses, or other amounts
due, or alleged to be due, to a third Person with respect to the alleged
Environmental Defect and the effect of any applicable limitation on the use or
operation of the affected Asset due to the Environmental Defect imposed by a
Governmental Authority or due to any remediation or other curative response. 

 



23 (c) The Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount or adjustment to the Purchase Price.

6.4 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_.

(a) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on a resolution with respect
to any Environmental Defect prior to Closing. Sellers may, at their collective
option (and at their sole cost, risk, and expense), attempt to cure such
Environmental Defect at any time prior to Closing. For each claim asserted by
Purchaser for an Environmental Defect, with respect to which the Parties
cannot agree upon the Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Value
(or whether or to what extent the Environmental Defect has been cured or
remediated), at the sole option of Purchaser, (i) Sellers shall deliver to
Purchaser a written indemnity agreement, in form and substance reasonable
satisfactory to Purchaser, under which Sellers agree to fully, jointly and
severally indemnify Purchaser from any and all losses, costs, expenses,
claims and damages (including diminution in value) arising out of, or
resulting from, such Environmental Defect (in which case there shall be no
reduction in the Purchase Price), provided that such indemnification
obligation shall be limited to the Allocated Value for the affect Asset, or
(ii) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Environmental Defect Value
with respect to each Environmental Defect (or, subject to Section 6.5, in the
event that the Parties do not agree upon the existence of an Environmental
Defect, or the Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto, Purchasers
estimate of the Environmental Defect), provided that such reduction in the
Purchase Price shall not exceed the Allocated Value for the affected Asset.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the aggregate of all
Environmental Defects affecting an Asset exceeds the Allocated Value of such
Asset, such Asset shall be removed from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
the Assets, subject to Section 6.5.

 

(b) If on or before Closing the Parties have not agreed upon the validity of
any asserted Environmental Defect or have not agreed on the Environmental
Defect Value attributable thereto, either Party shall have the right to elect
to have the validity of such Environmental Defect or such Environmental Defect
Value determined by an independent expert pursuant to Section 6.5. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any adjustment
to the Purchase Price for Environmental Defects shall be subject to Section
5.5(d).

(d) Without limitation of the rights of Purchaser pursuant to this Article 6,
Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration,
development and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain
asbestos, hazardous substances (as defined in applicable Environmental Laws)
or naturally occurring radioactive materials (" _NORM_ "). NORM may affix or
attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale or in
other forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets may
contain NORM and other wastes or hazardous substances. NORM containing
material and/or other wastes or hazardous substances may have come in contact
with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils
or

 



24  sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, hazardous substances, and NORM from the Assets.

6.5 _Independent Environmental Expert_. Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to
agree on all Environmental Defect Values prior to Closing. If Sellers and
Purchaser are unable to agree by Closing, unless the applicable Asset is
excluded pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Purchasers estimate shall control for
the purposes of Closing pursuant to Section 12.3, and the Environmental
Defect Values in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.5. There shall be a single arbitrator,
who shall be a reputable environmental consultant or engineer with at least
ten (10) years experience in corrective environmental action regarding oil and
gas properties in the state in which the Assets that are the subject of the
dispute are located, as selected by agreement of Sellers and Purchaser within
five (5) Business Days after Closing, and absent such agreement, by the
Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental
Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Harris County,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section. The Environmental
Arbitrators determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 6.3
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.
Additionally, the Environmental Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Environmental Defect Values submitted by either Purchaser
or Sellers and shall not be empowered to award damages, interest or penalties
to any Party with respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting their respective cases and
indemnify and hold harmless the other Party with respect thereto. Sellers
(collectively) and Purchaser (individually) shall each bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator, including any costs
incurred by the Environmental Arbitrator that are attributable to such third
Person consultation. Within ten (10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Sellers and Purchaser of his award with respect to
an Environmental Defect Value and the aggregate of all Environmental Defect
Values attributable to the affected Asset is less than the Allocated Value for
the affected Asset, then Sellers shall convey the affected Assets to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount by which
the Purchase Price was reduced with respect to such affected Assets at
Closing, less the amount of any applicable Environmental Defect Values. If the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Sellers and Purchaser that
his award with respect to an Environmental Defect exceeds the Allocated Value
for such affected Asset, or the aggregate of all Environmental Defect Values
affecting such Asset exceed the Allocated Value for such Asset, then the
affected Asset shall be excluded from the contemplated transaction (and shall
constitute an Excluded Asset) and neither Party shall have any liability to
the other with respect to the Asset. With respect to any Asset affected by an
Environmental Defect that was conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, within ten
(10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Sellers and Purchaser of his award with respect to the applicable
Environmental Defect Value, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the 

 



25  amount, if any so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Sellers, and
Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Purchaser.

 

6.6 _Access Indemnity_. THE PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY,
RELEASE, PROTECT, SAVE AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL LOSSES AND CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY
CONDUCTED BY THE PURCHASER OR ITS AGENTS, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE
EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
LOSSES RESULTING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY OF SELLERS, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

notice or lapse of time or both, would be a default, breach or violation under
any term or provision of any instrument, agreement, contract, commitment,
license, promissory note, conditional sales contract, indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, lease or other agreement, instrument or arrangement to which

ARTICLE 8

PURCHASERS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Subject to the provisions of this Article 8, Purchaser represents and
warrants to Sellers as follows:

8.1 _Organization and Standing_. Purchaser is a limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and on the Closing Date will be duly qualified to carry on
its business in each State where the Assets are located and in each State
where failure to be so qualified could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Assets or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

8.2 _Power_. Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as presently conducted and to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement (and all documents required to be executed and delivered by
Purchaser at Closing). The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement (and such documents) and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (and thereby) will not violate, or be in
conflict with, any material provision of Purchasers governing documents or
any material provisions of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party
or by which it is bound, or, to its knowledge, any judgment, decree, order,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Purchaser.

8.3 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Purchaser of this Agreement (and all documents required to be
executed and delivered by Purchaser at Closing), and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (and thereby), have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on behalf of Purchaser. This Agreement constitutes (and,
at Closing, such documents shall constitute) Purchasers legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, subject, however, to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws for the protection of creditors,
as well as to general principles of equity, regardless whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

8.4 _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Purchaser has not incurred any liability,
contingent or otherwise, for brokers or finders fees relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which any Seller shall have
any responsibility whatsoever.

by any Person or Governmental Authority that impedes or is likely to impede
Purchasers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to

8.6 _Securities Law, Access to Data and Information_. Purchaser is familiar
with the Assets and it is a knowledgeable, experienced and sophisticated

acknowledges that the Assets are or may be deemed to be

 



30  "securities" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and certain
applicable State securities or Blue Sky laws and that resales thereof may
therefore be subject to the registration requirements of such acts. The
Assets are being acquired solely for Purchasers own account for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to resale, distributions or granting a
participation therein in violation of any securities Laws. 

8.7 _Purchaser s Evaluation_.

(a) Purchaser is experienced and knowledgeable in the oil and gas business and
is aware of its risks. Purchaser has been afforded the opportunity to examine
the Background Materials. Except for the representations and warranties of

or warranties, express or implied, written or oral, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the Background Materials or any other information relating to
the Assets furnished or to be furnished to Purchaser or its representatives by
or on behalf of Sellers, including, without limitation any estimate
with respect to the value of the Assets, estimates of reserves, estimates or
any projections as to events that could or could not occur, future operating
expenses, future workover expenses and future cash flow.

 

(b) In entering into this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that
it has relied and will rely solely on the terms of this Agreement and upon
its independent analysis, evaluation and investigation of, and judgment with
respect to, the business, economic, legal, tax or other consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including its own estimate
and appraisal of the extent and value of the petroleum, natural gas and other
reserves of the Assets, the value of the Assets and future operation,
maintenance and development costs associated with the Assets. Purchasers
representatives have visited, or, prior to Closing will visit, the offices of
Sellers and have been given (or, prior to Closing will be given) opportunities
to examine the Background Materials. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, Sellers shall not have any liability to Purchaser or its
affiliates, agents, representatives or employees resulting from any use,
authorized or unauthorized, of the Background Materials or other information
relating to the Assets provided by or on behalf of Sellers.

existing contractual obligations disclosed pursuant to Section 7.24 and

Purchaser terminates one or more of the Reimbursement Swaps on or before the
close of business on January 7, 2013, then Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser
for any costs incurred by Purchaser, including without limitation, any legal
or administrative costs, which are associated with such terminations. Such
reimbursement shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price and shall be paid
on or before ten days following receipt of a written notice from Purchaser to
Sellers containing the full costs with supporting detail to be reimbursed by
Sellers related to the termination of the Reimbursement Swaps.

9.2 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_. The Parties covenant and agree
with each other as follows:

(a) _Confidentiality_. All data and information, whether written or oral,
obtained from Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Records and Background Materials, whether obtained by Purchaser
before or after the execution of this Agreement, and data and information
generated by Purchaser based on data or information obtained from Sellers in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "
_Information_ "), is deemed by the Parties to be confidential. Until the
Closing (and for a period of one year after December 28, 2012, if Closing
should not occur for any reason), except as required by Law, Purchaser and
its officers, agents and representatives will hold in strict confidence the
terms of this Agreement, and all Information, except any Information which:
(i) at the time of disclosure to Purchaser by Sellers is in the public
domain; (ii) after disclosure to Purchaser by Sellers becomes part of the
public domain by publication or otherwise, except by breach of this commitment
by Purchaser; (iii) Purchaser can establish was rightfully in Purchasers
possession at the time of disclosure to Purchaser by Sellers; (iv) Purchaser
rightfully received from third Persons free of any obligation of confidence;
(v) is developed independently by Purchaser without the Information, provided
that the Person or Persons developing the data shall not have had access to
the Information; or (vi) the disclosure of which is reasonably necessary in
order to comply with applicable Transfer Requirements or Preferential Rights,
notices required to be given under applicable contracts or to seek approvals
and consents of Governmental Authorities for the conveyance of any Assets or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) _Return of Information._ If Closing does not occur and this Agreement is
terminated, if Sellers so request at any time, Purchaser shall: (i) return to
Sellers all copies of the Information in possession of Purchaser obtained
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, which Information is at the time
of termination required to be held in confidence pursuant to this Section 9.2;
and (ii) destroy any and all notes, reports, studies or analyses based on, or

 



33  incorporating, the Information. The terms of Section 9.2 shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

(c) _Injunctive Relief_. Purchaser agrees that Sellers will not have an
adequate remedy at law if Purchaser violates any of the terms of Sections
9.2(a) and (b). In such event, Sellers will have the right, in addition to
any other it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of the terms of Sections 9.2(a) and/or (b), or to obtain
specific enforcement of such terms.

 

(d) _Preferential Purchase Rights and Transfer Requirements_.

 

(i) Purchasers purchase of the Assets is expressly subject to all validly
existing and applicable Preferential Rights and Transfer Requirements.
Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send notices to
holders of any Preferential Rights and Transfer Restrictions (which notices
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), and
otherwise initiate all procedures which in Sellers good faith judgment are
reasonably required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preferential
Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to
(or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) the holder of any
Preferential Right or Transfer Requirement in order to obtain the waiver
thereof or compliance therewith.

 

(ii) Any Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 12\. The portion of the Purchase Price to
be allocated to any Asset or portion thereof affected by a Preferential Right
(a " _Preferential Asset_ ") or that becomes a Retained Asset shall be the
Allocated Value for such Asset. If a Preferential Asset or a Retained Asset
affects only a portion of an Asset and a portion of the Purchase Price has not
been allocated specifically to such portion of an Asset on the
Allocation Schedule, then the portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated
to such Preferential Asset or Retained Asset shall be determined in a
reasonable manner taking into account the net acreage (or net acre feet, as
appropriate) that the portion of such Asset affected by such Preferential
Asset or Retained Asset bears to the net acreage (or net acre feet, as
appropriate) in the entire Asset.

(iii) If the holder of a Preferential Right who has been offered a
Preferential Asset pursuant to Section 9.2(d)(i) elects prior to Closing to
purchase such Preferential Asset in accordance with the terms of such
Preferential Right, and Seller and Purchaser receive written notice of such
election prior to the Closing, such Preferential Asset will be eliminated from
the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Preferential Asset pursuant to Section
9.2(d)(ii).

(iv) In the event:

 

(A) a third Person brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the
Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a
Preferential Right;

 



34 (B) a third Person fails to exercise or waive its Preferential Right prior to
Closing, and the time for the exercise or waiver thereof pursuant to the
terms of the instrument creating such Preferential Right has not expired; or

(C) an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that has not been expressly
waived or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date,

 

then, unless otherwise agreed by Sellers and Purchaser, the Asset or portion
thereof affected by such Preferential Right or Transfer Requirement (a "
_Retained Asset_ ") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing
shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price which is allocated to
such Retained Asset pursuant to Section 9.2(d)(ii); _provided, however_ ,
that, in the event that a Retained Asset is an Asset other than a Property,
and Purchaser is assigned the Property or Properties to which such
Asset relates, but such Asset is not transferred to Purchaser due to the
unwaived Transfer Requirement, Purchaser and Seller shall continue after
Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver or consent
required under the Transfer Requirement so that such Asset may be transferred
to Purchaser upon receipt of such consent and waiver, and, if permitted
pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, Sections 5.9(b) and 5.9(c) shall
apply with respect to such Asset as though such Asset was subject to
unobtained governmental approvals.

(v) Any Retained Asset so held back at the initial Closing will be conveyed
to Purchaser at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing Date
with respect to such Retained Asset), within ten (10) days following the date
on which the Transfer Requirement has been satisfied, the time for exercising
the Preferential Right has expired (without exercise or any action, or threat
of action, to enforce such Preferential Right) or the suit, action or other
proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (iv)(A) above is settled or a
judgment is rendered (and no longer subject to appeal) permitting transfer of
the Retained Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and Sellers obtain
a waiver of or notice of election not to exercise or otherwise satisfy all
remaining Preferential Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such
Retained Asset as contemplated by this Section. At the delayed Closing,
Purchaser shall pay Sellers a purchase price equal to the amount by which the
Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained
Asset (as adjusted pursuant to Article 3 through the new Closing Date
therefor); _provided, however_ , if all such Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the initial
Closing are not obtained, complied with, waived or otherwise satisfied as
contemplated by this Section within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
initial Closing has occurred with respect to any Assets, then such Retained
Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and this Agreement unless Purchaser
elects to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset, in which case
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any objection and shall be obligated
to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for all claims, losses and damages with
respect to non-compliance with such Preferential Rights and Transfer
Requirements related to such Retained Asset.

(e) Sellers acknowledge that the Purchaser and its Affiliates may be required
to include statements of revenues and direct operating expenses and other
financial information relating to the Assets (" _Financial Statements_ ") in
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by
the Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to the Securities 

 



35  Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and that such Financial
Statements may be required to be audited. In that regard, Sellers shall
provide the Purchaser and its Affiliates reasonable access to such records
(to the extent such information is available) and personnel of Sellers as the
Purchaser and its Affiliates may reasonably request to enable the Purchaser
and its Affiliates, and their representatives and accountants, at the
Purchasers or its Affiliates sole cost and expense, to create and audit any
Financial Statements that the Purchaser and its Affiliates deem necessary.
Sellers shall consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of the
Financial Statements in any registration statement, report or other document
of Purchaser or its Affiliates to be filed with the SEC in which Purchaser or
such applicable Affiliate reasonably determines that the Financial
Statements are required to be included or incorporated by reference to
satisfy any rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure
obligations under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Upon request of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, Sellers shall
request the external audit firm that audits the Financial Statements to
consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of its audit opinion
with respect to the audited Financial Statements in any such registration
statement, report or other document. Sellers shall provide the Purchaser and
its Affiliates and their independent accountants with access to (i) any audit
work papers of Sellers independent accountants and (ii) any management
representation letters provided by Sellers to Sellers independent
accountants.

9.3 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Apportionment of Tax Liability_. All Taxes based on or measured by
production, purchase or sale of Hydrocarbons shall be deemed attributable to
the period during which such production occurred and not attributable to the
year in which such Taxes are assessed. Sellers shall be responsible for, and
shall bear and pay, such Taxes attributable to the period prior to the
Effective Time, and Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall bear and
pay, such Taxes for any period that begins at or after the Effective Time. All
property, ad valorem and similar Taxes with respect to the tax period in
which the Effective Time occurs shall be apportioned as of the Effective Time
between the Sellers and Purchaser, with such Taxes being allocated pro rata
per day between the period prior to the Effective Time and the period
that begins at or after the Effective Time. Sellers shall be responsible for,
and shall bear and pay, such Taxes attributable to the period prior to the
Effective Time, and Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall bear and
pay, such Taxes for any period that begins at or after the Effective Time.
The apportionment of Taxes between the Parties shall take place as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 12.2 in the Statement for
Taxes for which information is available at the Closing Date and in the final
statement prepared pursuant to Section 12.3(b) for all remaining Taxes, using
estimates of such Taxes if actual numbers are not available.

 

(b) _Tax Reports and Returns_. Sellers agree to file all Tax returns for the
period of time prior to the Effective Time, and Purchaser agrees to file all
Tax returns for the period of time at or after the Effective Time. Purchaser
and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to the Assets, including, without limitation, access to books and records, as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax returns by Purchaser or
Sellers, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing authority and the

 



36  prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.
Purchaser agrees to file all Tax returns and reports applicable to the Assets
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and pay all required
Taxes payable with respect to the Assets subject to the provisions of Section
9.3(a). Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully with each other in the
conduct of any audit, litigation or other proceeding relating to taxes
involving the Assets or the allocation discussed in Section 3.2.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for and pay all
sales, transfer, use and similar Taxes arising from or associated with the
transfer of the Assets (other than Taxes based on income) and all costs and

Agreement and may not increase the Purchase Price more than the increase
proposed by Sellers nor decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease
proposed by Purchaser, as applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as
an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects
of Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.

presenting its case. Sellers shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear

accrue and become due prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) all liability of
any Seller to third parties for personal injury or death to the extent

operation of the Assets; _provided, however_ , that Sellers shall retain such
liabilities for personal injury or death beyond the twelve (12) month-period
to the extent, and only to the extent, covered and paid by Sellers insurance
(collectively " _Retained Obligations_ "). Seller and Purchaser agree that
suspense funds contained in suspense accounts (the " _Suspense Interests_ ")
as well as any and all responsibility, liability and/or obligations with
respect thereto will be retained by Seller, and Seller shall continue to
disburse and/or escheat such Suspense Interests as required by contract or
statute.

14.2 _Assumed Obligations_. Provided that the Closing occurs, Purchaser
hereby assumes all duties, obligations and liabilities of every kind and
character with respect to the Assets or the ownership, operation, condition or
use thereof, whether attributable to periods before or after the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, those arising out of (a) the terms of the
Material Agreements, Leases, or Assets or any other interests, contracts or
obligations comprising part of or directly related to the ownership or
operation of the Assets, (b) ad valorem, property, severance, production and

9.3(c), (c) the condition (including environmental condition, subject to the
remedies provided in Article 6) of the Assets, (d) obligations to properly
plug and abandon or re-plug or re-abandon or remove wells, flowlines,
gathering lines or other facilities, equipment or other personal property or
fixtures comprising part of the Assets, (e) subject to the remedies provided
in Article 6, obligations to restore the surface of the Assets and obligations
to remediate or bring the Assets into compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws (including conducting any remediation activities that may be required on
or otherwise in connection with activities on the Assets) regardless of
whether such obligations or conditions or events giving rise to such
obligations arose, occurred or accrued before or after the Effective Time and
any other duty, obligation, event, condition or liability assumed by
Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement and (f) Sellers obligations to
retain and manage, either through suspense or escrow accounts a portion of the
Gross Proceeds, as defined in the LLandE ORRI Conveyance attributable to the
interest of

 



46  LLandE Royalty Trust (the " _Trust_ ") pursuant to that certain Conveyance of
Overriding Royalty Interest (the " _LL andE ORRI Conveyance_") from the
Louisiana Land and Exploration Company to the Trust dated June 28, 1983 (the
" _LL andE Excess Production Cost Obligation_") (collectively, the " _Assumed
Obligations_ ").

 

14.3 _Purchaser s Indemnification_. Provided that the Closing occurs,
Purchaser shall release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, its
partners and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, partners, representatives, members, shareholders,
affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities,
losses, causes of action, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
those involving theories of negligence or strict liability and
including court costs and attorneys fees) (collectively, the " _Losses_ ")
as a result of, arising out of, or related to, (a) the Assumed Obligations,
(b) Purchasers breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained
in Section 9.2, or (c) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser in Article 8, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE
JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF
THE SELLER INDEMNITEES, BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, and further excluding, in each case, Losses against which Sellers
would be required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 14.4 other than
Losses associated with claims for indemnity by Seller for the Assumed
Obligations in subparts (c), (d) and (e) of Section 14.2.

14.4 _Sellers  Indemnification_. Provided that the Closing occurs, Sellers
shall, severally but not jointly and severally, release, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser, its partners, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, members, shareholders,
affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ")
from and against any and all claims arising out of, or relating to, (a) the
Retained Obligations, but only as to matters for which Purchaser has provided
Sellers a specific written claim on or before the end of the period of time
for which each obligation or liability is retained by Sellers, (b) such
Sellers breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in Article 9,
or (c) the breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller in
Article 7, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE, JOINT,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE
PURCHASER INDEMNITEES, BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT.

 

14.5 _Limitation for Sellers  Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers
indemnification obligation under Section 14.4 shall only apply if (a)
Purchaser has provided Sellers with written notice claiming indemnification
(i) with respect to Retained Obligations, on or before the date on which the
applicable Retained Obligation expires pursuant to Section 14.1, and (ii)
with respect to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, on or before the date on which the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement expires pursuant to Section 15.3. 

 



47 (b) Purchaser shall bear sole responsibility for the aggregate costs
associated with all claims made under Section 14.4 up to a deductible
percentage of one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price. It is the intent that
the Sellers only be obligated to the extent of the excess of the claims made
under Section 14.4 above the deductible percentage of one percent (1%).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims made by Purchaser in connection with
Excluded Assets, with respect to the Retained Obligations in Section
14.1(a)(ii), (v), or with respect to breaches by Sellers of their
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in Section 5.5(e), 7.1,
7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8, 7.20, 7.21, Article 9 and the special warranty
of title in the Conveyance, shall not be subject to the deductible
provided in this Section 14.5. The aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to
this Article 14 shall be limited to an amount equal to twelve and one-half
percent (12.5%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is qualified by materiality or material adverse effect shall be
deemed not to be so qualified for purposes of indemnification pursuant to this
Section 14.4. The Parties shall treat, for tax purposes, any amounts paid
pursuant to this Article 14 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

14.6  _Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters_. Each Party shall promptly
notify the other Party of any matter of which it becomes aware and for which
it is entitled to indemnification from the other Party under this
Agreement (" _Indemnity Claims_ "); _provided, however_ , that failure of a
Party to so notify any other Party shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of
its obligations, except to the extent that such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the indemnifying Party to
effectively defend against any third Person claim. The indemnifying Party
shall be obligated to defend, at the indemnifying Partys sole expense, any
litigation or other administrative or adversarial proceeding against the
indemnified Party relating to any matter for which the indemnifying Party has
agreed to indemnify and hold the indemnified Party harmless under this
Agreement. However, the indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such matter at its own
expense.

ARTICLE 15

15.2 _Independent Investigation_. Purchaser represents and acknowledges that
it is knowledgeable of the oil and gas business and of the usual and customary
practices of producers such as Sellers and that it has had (or will have prior
to the Closing) access to the Assets, the officers and employees of Sellers,
and the books, records and files of Sellers relating to the Assets, and in
making the decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser has relied solely on the basis of
its own independent due diligence investigation of the Assets and upon the
representations and warranties made in Article 7, and not on any other
representations or warranties of Sellers or any other person or entity. 

15.3 _Survival_. Purchasers liability for the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement shall
indefinitely survive the Closing. Sellers liability for the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations of Sellers under Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,
7.4, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8, 7.20, 7.21 and Article 9 shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. Sellers liability for the representation and warranty in
Section 7.22 shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations period. The remainder of the representations and warranties of
Sellers in Article 7 shall survive Closing for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Closing, after which Sellers shall have no liability or obligation in
relation thereto except as to matters for which Purchaser has provided
Sellers a specific written claim on or

 



49  before such termination date; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the obligation of Sellers with respect to
the Excluded Assets shall indefinitely survive the Closing. The remainder of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely, except as specifically
provided herein.

ARTICLE 16

in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither Party
shall be entitled to any reimbursement for such expenses from the other
Party.

Parties and specifically referencing this Agreement and identified as a
supplement, amendment, alteration, modification or waiver.

Party shall issue any public announcement or statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby without the consent of the other Parties,
unless such announcement or statement is required by applicable law or stock

14.4, nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any third Person
or entitle any third

 



50  Person to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being
the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall otherwise not be construed

counterclaim brought by any Party against another in any matter whatsoever
arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement.
