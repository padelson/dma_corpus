properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share (or, under the circumstances described in
_Section 2.6(e)_, the transferee of the Company Common Stock previously

compensation committee action as authorized under the Company Equity Incentive
Plan, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall become

 



      
 

 



 

fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase rights thereon shall lapse
and all such Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash (without
interest thereon) in dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of

vesting, excluding for this purpose any shares receiving payment pursuant to
_Section 2.5_, and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that
is unvested and outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully
vested in accordance with the applicable award agreement and all such Company

(d) _Company Performance RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Company

(e) _Payment Procedures_. Before the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such lawful actions as may be necessary (which include satisfying the

subject in all cases to the requirements of applicable Law, including Section
409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.7_, the Company shall in no event take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of or a penalty under the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the applicable holders of Company Compensatory Awards will
receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Entity, through its
payroll system, payroll provider and/or equity award maintenance systems, of
all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of such Company
Compensatory Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)_, _Section 2.7(c)_ or _Section 2.7(d)_ as applicable; provided that
such payment shall be made at such other time or times following the Effective
Time consistent with the terms of the Company RSU Award or Company Performance
RSU Award, as

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional
income tax under Section 409A of the Code. All such payments will be less any
applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment
owed to a holder of Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_,
_Section 2.7(c)_ or _Section 2.7(d)_ as applicable, cannot be made through
the Companys or the Surviving Entitys payroll system, payroll provider

courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event
more than two Business Days thereafter).

 



 

Section 2.8 _Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or other transactions contemplated
hereby.

of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company or otherwise) take such action.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

shares of Company Common Stock, and from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
_Section 2.7_, such amount as Parent, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, then for all purposes of this Agreement such
amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or other Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Lost Company Stock Certificates_. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an

to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend that, for U.S. federal, and
applicable state, income tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated as a
taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to Acquisition Sub
in exchange for the Merger Consideration to be provided to the stockholders of
the Company and the assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed
by the distribution of such Merger Consideration to the stockholders of the
Company in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562
of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of
liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties
further intend that, for U.S. federal, and applicable state, income tax
purposes, the Additional Transactions shall be treated as described in
_Schedule_

 



      
 

 



 

 _C_ (to the extent described). The parties hereto agree not to take any
position (or permit their Affiliates to take any position) on any tax return
that is inconsistent with the foregoing for all U.S. federal, and, if
applicable, state and local tax purposes.

authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement on behalf of the
Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Acquisition Sub,
enforceable against Acquisition Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to
(A) laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the
relief of debtors, and (B) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention; Consents_. Except for violations and defaults
that would not adversely affect Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to
perform any of its obligations under, or consummate any of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement, the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Acquisition Sub, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will not: (i) cause a violation of any of the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Acquisition Sub; (ii)
cause a violation by Parent or Acquisition Sub of any Law applicable to Parent
or Acquisition Sub; or (iii) cause a default on the part of Parent or

filing with or to obtain any consent from any Person at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent or Acquisition Sub or the consummation by Parent or Acquisition Sub
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except where the
failure to make any such filing or obtain any such consent would not adversely
affect Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to perform any of its obligations
under, or consummate any of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.
No vote of Parents equityholders is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to
approve any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Affiliates, within the past five years, has been, an "interested stockholder"
or an affiliate of an "interested stockholder" of the Company (as such term is

Section 4.6 _Available Funds_. Parent has received and accepted, and has
delivered to the Company true, correct and complete fully executed copies of
(i) the Equity Commitment Letter from the Sponsors to invest, subject to the
terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein
(being collectively referred to as the " **Equity Financing** "), and (ii) a
commitment letter (together with all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto)
from the Debt Financing Sources and any fee letters (subject to customary
redactions of fee and other economic amounts) (collectively, the " **Debt
Commitment Letter** " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
**Financing Commitment Letters** ") to provide, on the terms and subject only
to the conditions expressly stated therein, debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " **Debt Financing** "
and, together with the Equity Financing, the " **Financing** "). As of the
date hereof, none of the Financing Commitment Letters has been withdrawn,
terminated, repudiated, rescinded, supplemented, amended or modified and no
terms thereunder have been waived. As of the date hereof, Parent or
Acquisition Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Financing Commitment Letters that are required to be paid
as of the date hereof. The net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter (both before and after giving effect to
any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) will, in the
aggregate be sufficient for Parent and Acquisition Sub and the Surviving
Entity to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and Financing Commitment
Letters, including payment of the Merger Consideration, repayment or
refinancing of debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, and payment of any other fees and
expenses and obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent or
Acquisition Sub at the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing. The Financing Commitment
Letters are, as to Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent and
Acquisition Sub in accordance with their terms, in each case, as enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar applicable
Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach under any of the Financing Commitment Letters.
As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe (both before
and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter) that any of the conditions to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing at the Closing will not be satisfied on a timely basis
at the Closing or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available
to Parent or Acquisition Sub on the Closing Date. The Financing Commitment
Letters contain all of the conditions precedent and other conditions and
contingencies to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full
amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no
side letters or other written agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related (directly or
indirectly) to the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters. The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will
continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as
set forth therein. The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the Merger at Closing upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth
in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ are not contingent on Parents or
Acquisition Subs ability to obtain the Financing.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, including the Financing and the payment of the Merger
Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Commitment Letters, (c) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 3_
hereof, (d) payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (e)
payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving
Entity will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " **Solvent** " when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z) such Person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Guarantee_. Parent has furnished the Company with a duly
executed, true, complete and correct copy of the Guarantee. The Guarantee is
in full force and effect. The Guarantee is (a) a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsors and (b) enforceable in accordance with its
respective terms against such Sponsors. As of the date hereof, there is no
breach or default under the Guarantee by the Sponsors, and no event has
occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a breach or default) thereunder by the Sponsors.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Acquisition Sub_. All of the authorized membership interests of
Acquisition Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent and
such membership interests are validly issued and outstanding. Acquisition Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and, prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub will have
engaged in no business and have no Liabilities or obligations other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Agreements; Joint Venture Partner
Agreements_. As of the date hereof, neither Parent, Acquisition Sub nor any of
their Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), (a) pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive, in respect of any share of Company Common Stock,
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company has agreed to vote to adopt
this Agreement or has agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal or (b)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries or Joint Venture Partners has agreed to make an investment in, or
contribution to, Parent or Acquisition Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case that would not terminate and be
void concurrently with any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_. As of the date hereof, there are no agreements, arrangements or
understandings (in each case, whether oral or written) between Parent or
Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management
or directors, on the other hand, that relate in any way to, or are in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub or
any of their respective directors, officers or employees, for which the
Company may become liable.

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents,
financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives (collectively " **Representatives** ") to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or
negotiations with, any Person that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, and promptly following the date hereof, the Company
shall request that all non-public information previously provided by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person be
returned or destroyed in accordance with the applicable confidentiality
agreement. The Company will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
each of its and their Representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (including by approving any

purposes of the MGCL), (ii) furnish any information regarding the Company or
its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with, or in response to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) release or permit the
release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of
any provision of, any standstill or similar agreement to which any of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, other than to the extent
the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to provide such waiver,
release or termination would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(a)_,
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 5.2_ and which the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company
and its Representatives may: (i) provide information in response to a request
therefor by the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, but only if, prior
to providing any material non-public information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries to such Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and/or (ii) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with such Person who made such Acquisition
Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, prior to taking any action
described in clause (i) or (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel that failure to take such action, in
light of such Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Prior to or concurrent with providing any
material non-public information to such Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall make such material non-public information
available to Parent (to the extent such material non-public information has
not been previously made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
representatives).

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as
permitted by this _Section 5.2_: (i) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, the Board Recommendation (or
publicly propose or resolve to so

 



      
 

 



 

withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the Board Recommendation); (ii) approve,
recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal (or publicly propose
or resolve to so approve, recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal) (any action described in clause "(i)" or clause "(ii)" being
referred to as a " **Change in Recommendation** "); or (iii) cause the Company
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, investment agreement or other Contract of any kind with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 5.2(b)_) contemplating an
Acquisition Proposal (any such contract, an " **Alternative Acquisition
Agreement** ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may:

 



 

(i) make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal if:
(A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section
5.2(a)_; (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that (1)
such Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement were not amended or an
alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into, constitute a
Superior Proposal, and (2) in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to
make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a
written notice (the " **Superior Proposal Notice** "), four Business Days in
advance of any Change in Recommendation, stating that the Company Board
intends to effect a Change in Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal or to terminate this Agreement pursuant _Section 7.1(h)_, which
Superior Proposal Notice shall specify the identity of the party who made such
Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the most current version of the related
Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (D) during the four Business Day period
commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice,
the Company shall, and shall have made its representatives reasonably
available to, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or a possible alternative transaction, in either case, as would
permit the Company Board not to effect a Change in Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ in response to a Superior Proposal; (E) the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in
writing by Parent and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that (1) the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect and (2) the
failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law; and (F) if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_; _provided_ , that the Company
will not effect a Change in Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal, or take any action pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ with respect to a
Superior Proposal, prior to the time that is four Business Days after it has
provided the Superior Proposal Notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal
Notice,

 



      
 

 



 

which shall require a new notice period of two Business Days, and compliance
with this _Section 5.2(d)_ with respect to such new notice; or

 



 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation of the type described in clause (i) of
the definition thereof in response to a Change in Circumstances if: (A) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to
effect such a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; (B) such Change in Recommendation is not
effected prior to the fourth Business Day after Parent receives written notice
from the Company confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such
Change in Recommendation; (C) during such four Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement or enter into an alternative transaction; and
(D) at the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after
taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent and
Acquisition Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(C)" above, that, in light of such Change
in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
compliance with clauses "(B)" through "(D)" of this _Section 5.2(d)(ii)_ with
respect to any Change in Circumstances, the Company shall have no further
obligations under clauses "(B)" through "(D)" of this _Section 5.2(d)(ii)_,
and the Company Board shall not be required to comply with such obligations
with respect to any other Change in Circumstances.

 



 

(e) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal) notify Parent in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal (which notification shall include the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof), and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, as to the status (including any material
developments) of such Acquisition Proposal, including by providing Parent with
copies of any draft agreements or material terms and conditions related
thereto. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter any
confidentiality (or similar) agreement subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material
terms and conditions and other information or otherwise complying with this
_Section 5.2_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ that if any such disclosure
does not reaffirm the Board Recommendation or state that the Board
Recommendation remains unchanged, such disclosure will be deemed to be a
Change in Recommendation and Parent will have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section 7.1(h)_.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i) in the event
that a filing is required pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger,

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, to consent
to such action by the Company in any such case of (i)-(iv). Parent shall pay

Company shall not be required to pay any fees or make any other payments to
any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or
such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section 5.3_,
subject to applicable Law, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties

connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding.

 



 

(c) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial

litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and

efforts to contest any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the

(d) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be

consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the Company
shall afford Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal

concerning their respective businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Acquired Companies
shall not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose
any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a)
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties; (b) violate
any obligation of the Acquired Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-
disclosure or privacy (provided that the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts

 



      
 

 



 

to secure the consent of any third party or enter into a joint defense
agreement if necessary to permit the disclosure of applicable information to
Parent and its Representatives); (c) jeopardize protections afforded the

representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. All requests for access

Company or another person designated in writing by the Company.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, contact
any tenant, supplier or partner of the Company in connection with the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
Companys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree
that any such contact shall be arranged by and with a Representative of the
Company participating. All information obtained by Parent and its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be treated as "
**Evaluation Material** " (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of the

such other public announcement without the consent of the other parties
hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that (a) a party hereto may, without the prior consent of
the other parties hereto, issue any press release or make any public statement
as may be required by Law or the applicable rules of NYSE if it has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and
to obtain such parties consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time
such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made,
and (b) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation or
obtain any such consent with respect to any communication (i) that is
principally directed to employees, partners, vendors or tenants so long as
such communications are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures
or public statements

 



      
 

 



 

made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved the other party), or
(ii) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change in
Recommendation (in each case, in accordance with _Section 5.2_) or "stop-
look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Other Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than 12 months after the Closing Date, Parent
shall ensure that Greystar or one of its Affiliates provides to each employee
of the Acquired Companies who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving
Entity or Greystar or one of its Affiliates following the Effective Time
(each, a " **Continuing Employee** ") with base pay, bonus and commission
targets, severance and other benefits that are substantially not less
favorable in the aggregate than as provided to similarly situated employees of
Greystar Management Services LLP. Parent shall provide to each employee of the
Acquired Companies who is not a Continuing Employee (as determined by Parent
in its sole discretion) (each, a " **Non-Continuing Employee** ") severance
pay and benefit terms (" **Severance Pay** ") set forth in _Section 5.7(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms set forth in
_Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that the
termination of employment of some or all Non-Continuing Employees occurs on or
following the Closing Date results in or contributes to the existence of a
qualifying event under any WARN Act, Parent shall be responsible for all
notice and payment requirements under such WARN Act.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause Greystar or one of its Affiliates to ensure that, as of
the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all
purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the Acquired
Companies (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such
past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Greystar or one of its Affiliates in which such employees became
participants; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall ensure that Greystar or one of its Affiliates
provides full credit to each Continuing Employee for the accrued vacation
balance of such Continuing Employee. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
ensure that Greystar or one of its Affiliates credits Continuing Employees
with the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any
applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time. With respect to each
health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Greystar or one of its Affiliates
for the benefit of Continuing Employees, Parent (i) shall cause to be waived
any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan and
(ii) shall cause each Continuing Employee to be reimbursed for any out-of-
pocket expenses (excluding co-payments that do not apply to deductibles)
incurred between the Effective Time and December 31, 2017 in connection with
meeting any individual deductibles and individual out-of-pocket maximums under
such plan, provided that (A) such Continuing Employee has already met the
individual deductible and individual out-of-pocket maximum under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time or (B) such
Continuing Employee has not met the individual deductible or individual out-
of-pocket maximum under the applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the
Effective Time and has paid, in the aggregate for 2017, $4,500 (if the
Continuing Employees

 



      
 

 



 

out-of-pocket maximum under the applicable Company Benefit Plan in which he or
she participated prior to the Effective Time is $4,500) or $5,000 (if the
Continuing Employees out-of-pocket maximum under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which he or she participated prior to the Effective Time is
$5,000) in out-of-pocket expenses under the applicable Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time and such plan maintained by Greystar or one of its
Affiliates at and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Parent shall ensure that Greystar or one of its Affiliates pay any annual
bonus for 2017 at 100% of target and any commissions for 2017 that have been
earned by each employee of the Acquired Companies, but have not been paid as
of the Effective Time, at such time as they would have otherwise been paid
under the Companys bonus plan, unless otherwise provided on Schedule 5.7(a)
attached to _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to assume and honor in accordance
with their terms all deferred compensation plans, agreements and arrangements,
severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements, and all
written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in control and
termination agreements (including any change in control provisions therein)
applicable to employees of the Acquired Companies and in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If directed by Parent in writing at least ten
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to effectuate any amendment, consent or assignment needed to ensure
that such agreements are transferred to Greystar or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, without any liability being incurred by Parent, the Surviving
Entity, Greystar or one of their Affiliates.

 



 

(e) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than
the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by Parent). Furthermore, if
directed by Parent in writing at least ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall help effectuate any amendment, consent or
assignment needed to ensure that the Company Benefit Plans (other than the
agreements described in Section 5.7(d)) are transferred to the Surviving
Entity, Greystar or an Affiliate, as applicable.

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent (including Greystar and its Affiliates) agree to
comply with the Code Section 280G-related obligations set forth on _Section
5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of
its benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity, or any of their
Affiliates, (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of
any Acquired Company with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits

 



      
 

 



 

that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or
under any benefit plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity or an
Affiliate may maintain.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_ _._

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Acquired Companies and the Surviving Entity shall, and
Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies and the Surviving Entity to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies in respect
of rights of indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses for all acts or omissions or alleged actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before, at or
after the Effective Time, existing in favor of any Indemnified Party pursuant
to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between any Acquired Company
and any Indemnified Party and (ii) any indemnification, exculpation from
liability or advancement of expenses provision set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Companies as in effect on the date hereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by Law, the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity shall contain the provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses set forth in the Acquired Companies Organizational Documents on the
date hereof and, from and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.8(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary thereof,
the Acquired Companies and the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause
the Acquired Companies, and the Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against and from any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or
inquiry, whether civil, criminal, regulatory, legislative administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration,
investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of any Acquired Company to the extent such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time)
or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent or the Surviving Entity a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section
5.8(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies, and the Surviving Corporation
to, advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim, Legal Proceeding,
arbitration, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Party
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with any such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry;
provided that the Indemnified Party shall have made an

 



      
 

 



 

undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this _Section
5.8(b)_.

 



 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Acquired Companies and the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause
the Acquired Companies, and the Surviving Entity to, cause to be maintained in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, at least the current level
and scope of directors and officers liability insurance coverage as set
forth in the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect as of the date hereof with respect to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission occurring before or at the Effective
Time, including with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of
the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Entity shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination, provides
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company may obtain a prepaid
"tail" policy (the " **Tail Policy** ") prior to the Effective Time, which
policy provides the Indemnified Parties with directors and officers
liability insurance for a period ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time with respect to any action or omission or alleged action
or omission occurring before or at the Effective Time, including with respect
to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
payment for insurance coverage provided by such Tail Policy shall not exceed
250% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company. The
Acquired Companies and the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the
Acquired Companies, and the Surviving Entity to, cause any such Tail Policy to
be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored. Any such Tail Policy will satisfy
Parents obligations under this _Section 5.8(c)_ to obtain or provide
directors and officers liability insurance.

 



 

(d) In the event any of Parent, any Acquired Company or the Surviving Entity
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving
Entity or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of such Acquired Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.8_ shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or the Surviving
Entity, under any other indemnification arrangement, under the MGCL, the DLLCA
or otherwise. This _Section 5.8_ shall survive the Effective Time and shall
also survive consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time. This _Section
5.8_ is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs, Representatives, successors and assigns, and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity.
_Section 5.8_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was an officer
or director of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be an " **Indemnified Party**."

 



 

Section 5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including any shares
subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company RSU Awards or Company
Performance RSU Awards) by each Person who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to the exceptions set forth on
_Section 5.1(o)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall
promptly advise Parent in writing of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep
Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis regarding any such Transaction
Litigation, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to (a)
participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation, and (b) consult with
counsel to the Company regarding the defense, settlement or compromise with
respect to any such Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this _Section
5.10_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise adversely
affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such
Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith, but
Parent will not be afforded any decision making power or other authority over
such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ that the Company shall not settle or
compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction Litigation without
Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), subject to _Section 5.1(o)(2)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties may
continue to retain counsel retained prior to the Effective Time to defend any
Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall
Parent be required to retain more than one pre-Effective Time counsel for all
the Indemnified Parties as a group, unless required by conflicts of interest
between or among the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting; Vote of
Parent_. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, and, in any event, within 30 calendar days after the date of this

form for the Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the " **Proxy
Statement** "). The Company will prepare and provide to Parent a draft of the
preliminary Proxy Statement, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and, in any event, within 25 calendar days of execution of this

material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied by
it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any

 



      
 

 



 

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall promptly, and in any event, within 48 hours,
notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and will promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Subject to
_Section 5.3_ and applicable attorney-client privilege, the Company and
Parent will each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses
to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the
SEC and the Company will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed (i)
if the SEC provides comments to the preliminary Proxy Statement, as promptly
(and in any event within five Business Days) after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement or (ii) if, within 10 calendar days after
the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company has not received
comments to the preliminary Proxy Statement, no later than the 5th Business
Day after such 10th calendar day. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cooperate, and shall cause
their Affiliates to cooperate, with the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing
to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required, or
otherwise reasonably requested by the Company, to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement under applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such information
supplied by it and its Affiliates in writing for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting or filed with the SEC (as
applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider Parents comments in
good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no
responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf
of Parent or Acquisition Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.11(a)_, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall,
in accordance with applicable Law and the Companys governing documents, duly
set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof, the " **Stockholder Meeting** ") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon the matters requiring stockholder approval;
_provided_ that (i) the Stockholder Meeting shall be held as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not more than 45 days) after the date of mailing
of the Proxy Statement and (ii) the Company will not postpone or adjourn the
Stockholder Meeting except (A) to the extent required by Law, (B) with the
written consent of Parent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion, (C)
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, (D) for the absence of a quorum, or (E) after
consultation with Parent, to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Stockholder Meeting. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.2(d)_, the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders
of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall take all lawful action
to solicit such approval of the Merger and such other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, the
Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Stockholder Meeting
in accordance with _Section 5.11_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any
Superior Proposal or other Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in
Circumstances or any Change in Recommendation. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 7.1_, (x) the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the

this _Section 5.11_ and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Stockholder Approval, and (y) the Company shall not submit
any Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the stockholders (other than the
Merger).

 



 

Section 5.12 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the terms and
conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any "flex"
provisions) described in the Financing Commitment Letters, and shall not
permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Commitment Letters if such
amendment, supplement, replacement modification or waiver (i) with respect to
the Financing Commitment Letters, reduces (or could have the effect of
reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (A) the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or
the Debt Financing is otherwise made available at Closing to fund such fees or
original issue discount and (B) after giving effect to such reduction and any
of the transactions referred to in clause (A) above, the representation and
warranty set forth in _Section 4.6_ shall be true and correct in all material
respects), or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing in a manner that
makes them more onerous to satisfy on the Closing Date, or (iii) expands,
amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing Commitment Letters, in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less
likely the funding of the full amount of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date (provided that, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 5.12(a)_, Parent and
Acquisition Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents and, subject to compliance with
_Section 5.12(b)_ below, Parent may replace all or any part of the Debt
Financing with Alternate Financing). Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any amendment, supplement, waiver, consent, modification or
replacement in respect of the Debt Commitment Letter and, at the written
request of the Company, provide the Company with such information and

 



      
 

 



 

documentation as shall be reasonably requested by the Company to allow the
Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities (subject to
compliance by Parent with any confidentiality provisions or restrictions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents relating to
the Debt Financing). Subject in each case to Parents obligation and right
with respect to Alternate Financing set forth in _Section 5.12(b)_ below,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not agree to the withdrawal, termination,
repudiation, reduction or rescission of any commitment in respect of the Debt
Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the financing
sources under the Debt Commitment Letter. For purposes of _Section 4.6_ and
this _Section 5.12_, (x) references to " **Financing** " shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 5.12(a)_, and
includes any Alternate Financing permitted pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_, (y)
references to " **Debt Financing** " shall include the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 5.12(a)_, and includes
any Alternate Financing permitted pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_ and (z)
references to " **Debt Commitment Letter** " shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section
5.12(a)_ and _Section 5.12(b)_.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on
the terms (including the market "flex" provisions) and subject only to the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Commitment
Letters (subject to the right to enter into Alternate Financing set forth
below); (ii) to promptly negotiate and enter into on the Closing Date
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions) contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter; and (iii) to satisfy (or seek a waiver of) all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and to consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give
the Company prompt written notice (and in any event within two Business Days)
(A) of any breach or default by any party to any of the Financing Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or
Acquisition Sub becomes aware, (B) of the receipt of any written notice from
any Debt Financing Source with respect to any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing,
and (C) if at any time for any reason Parent or Acquisition Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Upon the request by the Company, Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall promptly provide any information reasonably
requested by Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence, except to the extent providing such
information is protected by attorney-client privilege. Upon (x) the occurrence
of any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the second
preceding sentence, (y) if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes
unavailable and such portion is required to pay all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by this Agreement (including to fund the Merger Consideration, repay or
refinance the debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, and all other fees, expenses and
other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Surviving Entity pursuant to this Agreement and the Financings), or (z) Parent
elects or desires to replace all or any portion of the Debt Financing, in each
case, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing (any such
financing, " **Alternate Financing** ") from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger, the Financing and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing Commitment Letters (including
payment of the Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of debt of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letter, and all other fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated
to be paid by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Entity pursuant to this
Agreement and the Financing) with terms and conditions that are in compliance
with _Section 5.12(a)_ of this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of all agreements, arrangements
or understandings (including engagement letters, side letters and fee letters
(subject to customary redaction of fee and other economic amounts)) related to
any such alternative Debt Financing. Upon the entry into any commitment
letters or definitive documentation relating to any such Alternate Financing,
all references in this Agreement to "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt
Financing" shall be and shall be deemed to be a reference to such terms as
they relate to such Alternate Financing.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
reasonable best efforts to provide, to Parent, Acquisition Sub and each of
their Subsidiaries and Affiliates, in each case at Parents sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement,
syndication and consummation of the Debt Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) upon reasonable notice, participate in a reasonable number
of due diligence sessions, rating agency presentations, meetings and
presentations with prospective lenders (but not more than one primary bank
meeting), (ii) assisting with, and designating one or more members of senior
management of the Company to participate in, the preparation of customary
offering and syndication documents and materials, including bank information
memoranda, bank syndication material and packages, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency materials and presentations and similar documents
and materials, in connection with the Financing, and providing reasonable and
customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing customary
information (all such documents and materials, collectively, the " **Offering
Documents** "), (iii) furnish Parent reasonably promptly following Parents
reasonable request with the historical financial statements of the Company as
may be required by the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt
Financing (subject to the immediately following proviso, the " **Required
Financial Information** "); provided, that, in no event will the Required
Financial Information be deemed to include or shall the Company otherwise be
required to provide projections, pro forma financial statements or pro forma
adjustments related to the Debt Financing, (iv) reasonably cooperating in with
the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt raised
by Parent to complete the Merger, (v) subject to any valid limitations or
restrictions set forth in the applicable leases of tenants at

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Properties, so long as the operations of the Company Properties
are not unreasonably disrupted, allowing Parent and its Representatives to
conduct, at Parents sole expense, appraisal and environmental and engineering
inspections of each of the Company Properties; provided neither Parent nor its
Representatives shall conduct any physically intrusive inspections without the
Companys prior written consent; provided further, that Parent subject to and
in accordance with _Section 5.2(e)_ below shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and the applicable Subsidiaries of the Company as a result of
Parents or its Representatives inspection of the Company Properties, (vi)
requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with Parents
independent auditors, participate in accounting due diligence sessions and use
reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and consents from
the Companys independent auditors, (vii) assisting in the preparation of, and
executing and delivering, Financing Agreements and related definitive
documents, including guarantees (if required) and other certificates and
documents as may be requested by Parent, (viii) cooperating with Parent in
seeking from the Companys existing lenders such waivers, consents or payoff
letters which may be necessary in connection with the Financing, and (ix)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing and
to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available at the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.12(c)_, (1)
nothing will require cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise be in conflict with applicable law or would conflict with or violate
any agreement or Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
party, (2) (x) nothing will require the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, managers or employees to execute, deliver or
enter into, or perform any agreement, document, certificate or instrument with
respect to the Debt Financing (other than with respect to the authorization
and representation letters referred to above) and (y) no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document, contract
(other than with respect to the authorization and representation letters
referred to above) will be effective until the Closing and, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability (other than in connection with
the authorization and representation letters referred to above) in connection
with the Financing, prior to the Closing; and (3) none of the board of
directors (or equivalent bodies) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof will
be required to adopt or enter into any resolutions or take similar action
approving the Financing (except that concurrently with the Closing the boards
(or their equivalent bodies) of the Company and Subsidiaries of the Company
may adopt resolutions or take similar actions that do not become effective
until the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the provisions contained in this _Section 5.12(c)_ represent
the sole obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates with respect to cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Parent shall reimburse the Company promptly upon demand for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives in
connection with the cooperation

shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates and representatives (collectively, the " **Financing
Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages,
interest, awards and liabilities directly or indirectly suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the
Financing (including any alternate financing) and any information used in
connection therewith. This _Section 5.12(e)_ shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and the Closing and any termination of this Agreement, and is
intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and
their respective heirs, executors, estates, personal representatives,
successors and assigns who are each third party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.12(e)_.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_. Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and
agree to continue to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement. All
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement (including in connection with the any Debt
Financing) will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Acquisition Sub will be
permitted to disclose such information to Sponsors and to any financing
sources or prospective financing sources that may become parties to the Debt
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as each such Person (a) agrees for the benefit of the Company to be bound

other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
of which the Company is a third-party beneficiary.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in

date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, any of
the Company and its Subsidiary REITs may declare and pay a dividend to its
stockholders distributing cash in such amounts determined by the Company in
its sole discretion to be required to be distributed in order for the Company
or the Subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT for such year and to avoid to the
extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise tax by the
Company or the Subsidiary REIT. If the Company declares a dividend pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the per 
share amount of such distribution.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub covenant and agree with the Company that for
all relevant tax purposes Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Company, and
their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates, will treat the Merger and the Additional Transactions consistent
with _Section 2.12_, _Schedule C_ and _Schedule G_.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, and the Surviving Entity covenants and
agrees that from and after the Closing it (and/or its Affiliates) will take
all actions or forbear from taking such actions, or will cause the applicable
Subsidiary REIT to take all actions or forbear from taking such actions, as
necessary to ensure that each Subsidiary REIT will be classified as a REIT for
the taxable year of such entity that includes the Effective Time or that ends
with an Additional Transaction, including by causing each Subsidiary REIT to
satisfy the distribution requirements of Section 857(a) of the Code for such
taxable year and will not take or permit any of its Affiliates to take, any
action which is inconsistent with such REIT qualification for such taxable
year or any prior taxable year. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Entity, covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing it will
not take any action, or permit its Affiliates to take any action, including
the allocation of purchase price, that is inconsistent with the Companys
status as a REIT for any taxable year ending on or before the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Entity and the Company covenant and agree that Tax Returns of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including withholdings and
withholding Tax Returns) shall be prepared on a basis consistent with: (i)
_Section 2.12_; (ii) the principle that the Company qualifies as a REIT for
its taxable years ended on or after December 31, 2007 through the taxable year
of the Company ending with the Effective Time; (iii) the principle that each
Subsidiary REIT qualifies or has qualified as a REIT beginning with the first
taxable year for which it elected to be a REIT, and will continue to qualify
as a REIT for its taxable year that includes the Effective Time or that ends
with an Additional Transaction; and (iv) subject to the foregoing, in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent shall not and shall
not permit its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates to take any position on
any Tax Return that is inconsistent with (i) the past practice of the
applicable Subsidiary, (ii) the Companys status as a REIT for its taxable
years ended on or after December 31, 2007 through the taxable year of the
Company ending with the Effective Time or (iii) the status of any Subsidiary
REIT as a REIT for the period beginning with the first taxable year for which
the Subsidiary REIT elected to be a REIT through its taxable year that
includes the Effective Time or that ends with an Additional Transaction.

 



 

(e) All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added
and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (" **Transfer Taxes** ") will be borne by Parent. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing in a timely manner all
necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer
Taxes, shall provide satisfactory evidence satisfactory that such Transfer
Taxes have been paid and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount
of Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(f) On the Closing Date, prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent the fully executed Tax Opinion.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) On or before the Closing Date, the Company and each Subsidiary REIT shall
have filed its U.S. federal income Tax Return for the taxable year ended
December 31, 2016.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Additional Transactions_. The Company and Parent shall undertake
and consummate the transactions set forth on _Schedule C_ (the " **Additional
Transactions** ") prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any breach of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement
(other than as required pursuant to _Section 5.17(f)_), or any failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ (other than a failure to
satisfy any condition by reason of failing to comply with _Section 5.17(f)_),
that is attributable to one or more Additional Transactions shall not be
deemed a breach or failure by the Company; _provided_ that failure by the
Company to comply with the Additional Transactions, solely to the extent
expressly set forth on _Schedule C_ , shall be taken into account in
determining a Company breach.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and, following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Entity, shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and policies of the
New York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of the Company and of the
shares of Company Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, to be subject to requirements imposed by any
takeover statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination
statute or regulation" or other similar anti-takeover provisions under the
MGCL or similar Laws of any jurisdiction (each, a " **Takeover Statute** ")
may become, or may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Existing Loans_. Promptly following Parents request, the
Company shall deliver to each of its and the Company Subsidiaries lenders
under the Existing Loan Documents (and any other party whose consent is
required under the Existing Loan Documents) (the " **Existing Lenders** ") a
notice prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by the
Company, requesting that such Existing Lender deliver to Parent a written
statement or documents (the " **Assumption Documents** ") (i) confirming (A)
the amount of the existing Indebtedness under such Existing Loan Document, (B)
the date to which interest and principal has been paid, and (C) the amount of
any escrows being held by such Existing Lender under the Existing Loan
Documents; and (ii) consenting to (A) the assumption of the existing
indebtedness under such Existing Loan and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) the
modifications of the Existing Loan Documents that

 



      
 

 



 

Parent may reasonably request after the date hereof; _provided_ that the
Company shall be informed and consent to any such request or modification;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event Parent requests Assumption
Documents in accordance with this _Section 5.21_, (x) the receipt of (or
failure to receive) such Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the
Existing Lenders shall in no event be a condition to Parents and Merger
Acquisitions obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, or otherwise affect Parents and Acquisition
Subs obligations to pay the amounts to be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Entity under _Section 2.6_ and _Section 2.7_ of the Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger shall not be delayed or postponed as a result of
the receipt of (or failure to receive) such Assumption Documents from all or
any portion of the Existing Lenders and (y) the Assumption Documents will be
effective as of or immediately prior to and conditioned on the occurrence of
the Effective Time. Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in
connection with the Assumption Documents, including premiums for any
endorsements to or re-date of the title insurance policy previously issued to
the Existing Lenders, servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and
assumption fees, attorneys fees and disbursements and processing fees
required to be paid to the Existing Lenders as a condition to issuance of the
Assumption Documents (collectively, the " **Assumption Expenses** "). If
applicable, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket Assumption Expenses incurred by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section 5.21_.

extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such partys

provision of this Agreement, subject only, with respect to any such
Liabilities of the Company, to _Section 7.3(b)_, and with respect to any such
Liabilities of Parent and Acquisition Sub, to _Section 8.12(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the

Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ that for purposes of this subsection (iii), each reference to

earlier of (1) the date the Company enters into a definitive agreement with

doubt, any payment made by the Company under this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall be
payable only once with respect to _Section 7.3(b)_ and not in duplication,

Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination and except for the

any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement (other than equitable relief to require
payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or any Company Expenses), any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; _provided_ that if the Company fails to pay the
Company Termination Fee or any Company Expenses required to be paid hereunder,
and Parent and/or Acquisition Sub commences a Legal Proceeding which results
in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the Company
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay Parent and
Acquisition Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Company Termination Fee and/or Company Expenses at the "prime rate" as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed, without compounding) (the " **Company** **Recovery Costs** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_, then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day
following such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment by Parent
under this _Section 7.3(c)_ shall be payable only once with respect to
_Section 7.3(c)_ and not in duplication. In the event that the Company shall
receive full payment pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_, the receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee (together with any Parent Expenses and Parent Recovery
Costs, as applicable) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and except for the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub
pursuant to _Section 5.12(e)_, _Section 5.21_, this _Section 7.3(c)_ and
_Section 8.12(a)_ (collectively, the " **Parent Expenses** "), neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a
claim at law or in equity, to the Company or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding
against Parent or Acquisition Sub for damages or any equitable relief arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such
termination (other than equitable relief to require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses); _provided_ that if Parent fails
to pay the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a final, non-appealable judgment
against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses, or
any portions thereof, then Parent shall pay the Company its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination Fee and/or Parent
Expenses at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding) (the " **Parent**
**Recovery Costs** ").

 



 

Section 7.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_.

 



 

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs set
forth in _Section 7.3_, Parent shall pay to the Company from the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs
deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the
Parent Recovery Costs and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be
paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code ("
**Qualifying Income** "), as determined by the Companys independent certified
public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (A) a
letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a
ruling from the IRS described in _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ or (B) an opinion from
the Companys outside counsel as described in _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_, an amount
equal to the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Recovery Costs less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To
secure Parents obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into
escrow an amount in cash equal to the Parent Termination Fee, plus any Parent
Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs with an escrow agent selected by Parent
and on such terms (subject to _Section 7.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent
Recovery Costs pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be made at the time
Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to _Section 7.3_
by wire transfer.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Parent Termination Fee, plus
the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs in escrow or any portion
thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives
any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Companys
independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants revising that
amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the
Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company
of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent
Recovery Costs should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code (or alternatively, indicating that the Companys outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the
Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs
should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which
case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination
Fee, plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs to the Company.
Parent agrees to amend this _Section 7.4_ at the request of the Company in
order to (x) maximize the portion of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the
Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs that may be distributed to the
Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances
of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 7.4(b)_ or (z)
assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel as described in this _Section 7.4(b)_. The escrow agreement shall
also provide that any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, plus the Parent
Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs held in escrow for five years shall be
released by the escrow agent to Parent. Parent shall not bear any cost of or
have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires

representations and warranties of the Company or of Parent and Acquisition
Sub, in each case, contained in this Agreement, or contained in any

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to comply
in all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement the Merger, and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material
inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and
perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees
full performance and payment by Acquisition Sub of each of the covenants,
obligations and undertakings required to be performed by Acquisition Sub under
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby
represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Acquisition Sub shall also
be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the
right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available
remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly
against either or both of Parent and Acquisition Sub in the first instance,
subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance; Parent Liability Cap_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The
parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.1_ and any dispute over the right to termination
has been finally resolved, (i) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as
set forth in _Section 8.6_ to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any
remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section
7.3_, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without
that right, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub would have entered into this
Agreement. The Company agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief permitted by this
Agreement on the basis that (x) Parent or Acquisition Sub has an adequate
remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any of Parent or Acquisition Sub
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. In any Legal
Proceeding seeking monetary damages against a party or to compel a party to
specifically perform its obligations hereunder, the non-prevailing party in
such Legal Proceeding (after a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction) shall promptly reimburse the prevailing party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or
remedy a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquisition Sub or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in _Section
7.3(c)_; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent of _Section 5.13_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, while Parent
and Acquisition Sub may concurrently seek (i) specific performance or other
equitable relief and (ii) payment of the Company Termination Fee if, as and
when required pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_, under no circumstances shall
Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, directly or indirectly, be permitted
or entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of any monetary damages
whatsoever or the payment of all or any portion of the Company Termination
Fee, on the other hand, or (B) both payment of any monetary damages, on the
one hand, and payment of all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee, on
the other hand.

 



 

(d) The maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Acquisition Sub for monetary
damages in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the
Guarantee and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited
to the Parent Termination Fee plus the Parent Expenses and the Parent Recovery
Costs (collectively, the " **Parent Liability Cap** "), and, except for the
Companys right to payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and
Parent Recovery Costs, by Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or by
the Sponsors pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Sponsors, the Debt Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees (each,
a " **Parent Related Party** "). In no event shall the Company seek or permit
to be sought on behalf of the Company any monetary damages, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Sponsors, the Debt Financing Sources or any of Parent Related Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent
Expenses and the Parent Recovery Costs, in each case pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Sponsors, the Debt Financing Sources or any Parent Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ ,
_however_ , subject to the terms and conditions of, and limitations set forth
in, the Guarantee, the Company may seek payment by the Sponsors of the Parent
Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and/or the Company Recovery Costs, in each
case, to the extent payable under the terms of the Guarantee. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary and for the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.12_ nor _Section 7.3_ shall
limit in any way any fraud remedies or the remedies of the parties under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied
in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

Section 17. _Exculpation and Indemnification_.

limited liability company, neither the Member nor any present or former
officer, director or Manager of the Company or a predecessor of the Company
and no employee, representative, agent or affiliate of the Member
(collectively, the " ** _Covered Persons_** ") shall be liable to the Company
or any other Person who has an interest in or claim against the Company for
money damages. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 17(a), nor the
adoption or amendment of any other provision of this Agreement or any other
governing document of the Company inconsistent with this Section 17(a), shall
apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the provisions of this
Section 17(a) with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior
to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

 



 

(b) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
law, as applicable from time to time, the Covered Persons, whether serving or
having served, the Company or at its request any other entity, for any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) relating to any action alleged to
have been taken or omitted in such capacity as a Director or officer. The
Company shall pay or reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred by a Covered
Person, whether serving or having served, the Company or at its request any
other entity, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
in which the Covered Person is a party, in advance of the final disposition of
the proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by, and in accordance with the
applicable requirements of, Delaware law, as applicable from time to time. The
Company may indemnify any other Persons, including a Person who served a
predecessor of the Company as an officer or director, permitted to be
indemnified by Delaware law, as applicable from time to time, if and to the
extent indemnification is authorized and determined to be appropriate, in each
case in accordance with applicable law. No amendment of this Agreement or
other governing documents of the Company or repeal of any of its or their
provisions shall limit or eliminate any of the benefits provided to Covered
Persons under this Section 17(b) in respect of any act or omission that
occurred prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



 

(c) A Covered Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon
the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the Company by any Person as to matters the Covered
Person reasonably believes are within such other Persons professional or
expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on
behalf of the Company, including information, opinions, reports or statements
as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, or any other facts
pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to
the Member might properly be paid.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Covered Person has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Company
or to any other Covered Person, a Covered Person acting under this Agreement
shall not be liable to the Company or to any other Covered Person for its good
faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement or any approval or
authorization granted by the Company or any other Covered Person. The
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and
liabilities of a Covered Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by the Member to replace such other duties and liabilities of such
Covered Person.

 



 

(e) The foregoing provisions of this Section 17 shall survive any termination
of this Agreement.

a Member, to any lenders to the Member or the Company or any agent acting on
such lenders behalf, and any sale, assignment or transfer of such membership
interests pursuant to any such lenders (or agents) exercise of remedies in
connection with any such pledge shall be permitted under this Agreement with
no further action or approval required hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, upon the exercise of remedies in connection
with such pledge, any such purchaser, assignee or transferee of such
membership interests shall have the right, as set forth in the applicable
pledge agreement, and without further approval of any Member, shall become a

further action on the part of such purchaser, assignee or transferee and
without complying with any other procedures set forth in this Agreement, and
following such exercise of remedies the Member shall cease to be a Member and
shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Member shall constitute any
necessary approval of the Member under the Act to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 18. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and
so long as any of the membership interest is subject to a pledge, this Section
18 may not be amended or modified in any manner adverse to the pledgee without
the pledgees prior written consent.

activities as are necessary to wind up its affairs (including the sale of the
assets of the Company in an orderly manner), and the assets of the Company

of the assets of the Company, to compel any sale of all or any portion of the
assets of the Company pursuant to any applicable law or to file a complaint or

hereto, and this Agreement shall not be construed in any respect to be a
contract in whole or in part for the benefit of any third Person.

 



 

Section 23. _Severability of Provisions_.

 



 

Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable and if for any
reason any provision or provisions herein are determined to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal under any existing or future law, such invalidity,
unenforceability or illegality shall not impair the operation of or affect
those portions of this Agreement which are valid, enforceable and legal.
