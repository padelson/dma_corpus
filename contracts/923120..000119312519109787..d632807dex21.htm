shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to sell, transfer, assign,
convey or deliver any Acquired Asset to Buyers ( _provided_ that this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ shall not affect whether any asset, property or right
shall be deemed to be an Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability for any other
purpose under this Agreement), or for Buyers to assume any Assumed Liability,
in each case which is not transferable or non-assignable, as applicable,
without the consent or waiver of a third party (including any Governmental
Authority), in each case unless and until such consent or waiver shall have
been obtained (collectively, " _Non-Assignable Assets_"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.3_, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the
foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, all consents,
approvals and waivers required from a third party in connection with any
Material Non-Assignable Asset on terms that will ensure that Buyers and their

that, neither Seller nor any Subsidiary thereof shall be required to pay any
amounts or provide other consideration in connection with obtaining any such
consent, approval or waiver in connection with a Material Non-Assignable
Asset. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event any such
consent, approval or waiver cannot be obtained prior to Closing, then from and
after the Closing until such consent, approval or waiver shall have been
obtained (or earlier termination or expiration of the applicable Contract),
(i) Seller (x) with respect to each Non-Assignable Asset (other than the
Specified Contract, if the Specified Contract is a Non-Assignable Asset),
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and (y) with respect to the
Specified Contract (if the Specified Contract is a Non-Assignable Asset),
shall, in the case of clause (x) and clause (y), provide Buyer with the
benefits under each Non-Assignable Asset as if such Non-Assignable Asset had
been assigned to Buyer (including by means of any licensing, operating,
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement and by paying over to
Buyer any money or other consideration contemplated under _Section_ __ _
8.10(a)_), (ii) Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain good relations with any obligee or
other counterparty in connection with such Non-Assignable Asset, (iii) Buyer
(x) with respect to each Non-Assignable Asset (other than the Specified
Contract, if the Specified Contract is a Non-Assignable Asset), shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and (y) with respect to the Specified
Contract (if the Specified Contract is a Non-Assignable Asset), shall, in the
case of clause (x) and clause (y), pay, perform or otherwise

 



30

    

 discharge (in accordance with the respective terms and subject to the
respective conditions thereof, and in the name of Seller) all of the covenants
and obligations of Seller incurred with respect to such Non-Assignable Asset
or any Transferred Contract under which Seller or its Subsidiaries have not
been discharged fully from its or their obligations thereunder and (iv) Buyers
and Seller shall mutually cooperate to provide any other alternative
arrangements as may be reasonably required to implement the purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements; _provided_ , in each case,
that neither Seller nor any Subsidiary thereof shall be required to incur any
out-of-pocket costs. If and when such consent, approval or waiver is obtained,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, sell, transfer, assign,
convey and deliver such Non-Assignable Assets to Buyers for no additional
consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Non-
Assignable Asset that is a Contract relating to Software, the obligations of
each Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall in no event extend
beyond the one year anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c) In furtherance of, and without limiting or conditioning any of the rights,
remedies, liabilities, and obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including
the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, prior to the Closing Date,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate in good faith
to more fully document, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer
Parent, the undertakings set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)(iii)(y)_ of this
Agreement, including reasonably cooperating with the counterparty to the
Specified Contract to amend the existing Specified Contract. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, the failure of the Parties (or their Subsidiaries) to
reach such an agreement shall not impair, modify, delay, amend, or constitute
a waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the enforceability
thereof, including the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

2.6. _Title and Risk_. Seller shall continue to carry on the Business for its
own benefit and at its own risk up to the Closing. The Acquired Assets and the
Business shall be at the risk of Buyers only after the Closing.

 

2.7. _Prorations_. With respect to accrued Taxes for Transferred Real
Property, Transferred Tangible Property and other similar Taxes, utility and
similar payments arising from the ownership or use of the Acquired Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities and the operation of the Business, the accrued rents and
other payments under the Transferred Leases and the Transferred Contracts
and similar accrued items all as relating to a Straddle Period, (i) Buyers
shall be responsible for the pro rata portion thereof based upon the number of
days in such Straddle Period following (but not including) the Closing Date as
a percentage of the total number of days in such Straddle Period and (ii)
Seller shall be responsible for the pro rata portion thereof based upon the
number of days in such Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date
as a percentage of the total number of days in such Straddle Period (the "
_Seller Prorated Taxes_ "). Buyer Parent shall deliver written notice to
Seller specifying the amount of such Seller Prorated Taxes, together with a
reasonably detailed calculation thereof, and Seller shall promptly pay the
amount of such Seller Prorated Taxes to Buyer Parent. Buyer Parent shall,
within forty-five (45) days of the Closing Date, deliver written notice to
Seller specifying the amount of such Seller Prorated Taxes, together with a
reasonably detailed calculation thereof. If Seller agrees with Buyer Parents
calculation, Seller shall promptly pay the amount of such Seller Prorated
Taxes to Buyer Parent. If Seller disagrees with Buyer Parents calculation,
Seller shall notify Buyer Parent in writing of such disagreement within forty-
five (45) days after delivery of the notice specifying Buyer Parents

 



31

    

 calculation of the Seller Prorated Taxes, and Seller and Buyer Parent will
negotiate in good faith to determine the amount of Seller Prorated Taxes
(after which Seller shall promptly pay the amount of such Seller Prorated
Taxes to Buyer Parent).

2.8. _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing, Seller
and Buyers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions,
releases and acquittances and such other instruments, and shall take such
further actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to fully and effectively
sell, transfer, assign, and convey and deliver to Buyers all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be expressly conveyed to Buyers under this Agreement
and to fully and effectively sell, transfer, assign, and convey and deliver to
Buyers and their Subsidiaries the Assumed Liabilities intended to be assumed
by Buyers under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby and to confirm the right, title or
interest of Buyers in the Acquired Assets, including (i) promptly transferring
and/or delivering back to Seller and its Subsidiaries any asset or Liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be an Excluded Asset or an Excluded
Liability, respectively, which asset or Liability was transferred and/or
delivered to Buyers at the Closing and (ii) promptly transferring and/or
delivering to Buyers any asset or Liability contemplated by this Agreement to
be an Acquired Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively, which was not

PURCHASE PRICE

3.1.  _Estimated_ _Closing Statement_.

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of cash to be paid as the Estimated
Closing Payment by Buyer Sub (or, if any portion is not paid by Buyer Sub, by
Buyer Parent) at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer Parent, not less than three (3) Business Days
before the Closing Date:

(i) a good faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital (such amount, the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ");

(ii) a good faith estimate of the Business CapEx Amount (the " _Estimated
Business CapEx Amount_ ");

(iii) a good faith estimate of the Seller Business Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Seller Business Indebtedness_ ");

(iv) a good faith estimate of the Estimated Closing Payment; and

 

(v) a good faith estimate of the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.

 

Seller agrees that it shall prepare such statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") in accordance with, as applicable, the definitions of "Closing
Working Capital", "Business CapEx Amount", "Seller Business Indebtedness,"
"Estimated Closing Payment" and "Estimated Closing

 



32

    

 Purchase Price" as set forth herein and, in the case of the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, in accordance with _Schedule 1.1  Working Capital_,
and Seller shall deliver together with such statement any supporting
documentation and additional information as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer Parent with respect to the amounts set forth therein. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable access, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates, to such
personnel as are reasonably necessary to assist Buyers in their review of
the Estimated Closing Statement, and Seller shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments or changes proposed by Buyer with respect to the Estimated
Closing Statement or any amounts included therein.

 

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) (A) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Payment in U.S. dollars shall
be paid by Buyer Sub (or, if any portion is not paid by Buyer Sub, by Buyer
Parent) to Seller or its designee(s) in accordance with wire transfer
instructions delivered to Buyer Parent no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and (B) the Convertible Note shall be issued by
Buyer Parent to Seller;

(ii) the Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed by Buyer by the execution and
delivery of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and

(iii) the amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters delivered pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_, which amounts shall be included in the Estimated Seller
Business Indebtedness, shall be paid by Buyer Sub (or, if any portion is not
paid by Buyer Sub, by Buyer Parent) to the applicable lenders or
other parties as set forth in the Payoff Letters in accordance with wire
transfer instructions set forth in the Payoff Letters.

3.2. _Closing Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 60 days after the
Closing), Buyer Parent shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
setting forth Buyers calculation of:

(i) the Closing Working Capital (the " _Buyer-Calculated Closing Working
Capital_ ");

(ii) the Business CapEx Amount (the " _Buyer-Calculated Business CapEx
Amount_ ");

(iii) the Seller Business Indebtedness (the " _Buyer-Calculated Seller
Business Indebtedness_ ");

(iv) the Buyer-Calculated Closing Payment; and

 

(v) the Buyer-Calculated Purchase Price (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

 



33

    

(b) The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement and
determining the Buyer-Calculated Closing Working Capital, the Buyer-
Calculated Business CapEx Amount, the Buyer-Calculated Seller Business
Indebtedness, the Buyer-Calculated Closing Payment, the Buyer-Calculated
Purchase Price and the related adjustment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
3.2_ is to measure the amount of the Closing Working Capital, the Business
CapEx Amount and the Seller Business Indebtedness, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies.

3.3.  _Purchase Price Disputes_.

(a) The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each
other and their respective representatives reasonable access to their
respective books, records and personnel (during normal business hours), and in
a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Business, to the extent relating to the Business and
reasonably necessary throughout the periods during which the Closing Statement
is being prepared or evaluated and any disputes that may arise under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ are being resolved.

 

(b) If Seller disagrees with the determination of the Closing Statement,
Seller shall notify Buyer Parent in writing of such disagreement within
forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, which written
notice shall set forth any such disagreement in reasonable detail ("
_Disagreement Notice_ "). Matters included in the calculations in the
Closing Statement to which Seller does not object in the Disagreement Notice
shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall not be subject to further dispute
or review.

 

(c) Buyer Parent and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer Parent and
Seller shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

(d) If Buyer Parent and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Seller of a Disagreement Notice, Buyer Parent and Seller shall
jointly appoint the Accounting Firm to resolve such disagreement. The
parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to consider only those items and
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement as to which Seller has disagreed
pursuant to a Disagreement Notice and Buyer Parent and Seller have not
resolved such disagreement. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether such calculation was done in
accordance with the terms hereof, the accounting methods, standards, policies,
practices, classifications, estimation methodologies, assumptions or
procedures used to prepare the Closing Statement, and whether there were
mathematical errors in the calculation of the Closing Statement, and the
Accounting Firm shall not make any other determination. The Accounting Firm
shall make its determination based solely on written submissions,
presentations and supporting material provided by Buyer Parent and Seller and
not pursuant to any independent review. In resolving any such disagreement,
the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to such item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer Parent or by Seller or less than
the lowest value for such item claimed by Buyer Parent or by Seller. Buyer
Parent and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to deliver to all parties, as promptly as practicable, a
written report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement

 



34

    

 determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such report,
absent manifest mathematical error, shall be final and binding upon the
parties and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
arising in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall be borne by the
parties in such proportion to reflect the relative amount of each partys
determination that has been modified pursuant to the Accounting Firms report.
For example, if Seller claims in the Disagreement Notice that it is entitled
to an adjustment payment of $100,000, but the Accounting Firm determines that
Seller has a valid claim for only $30,000, then Buyer Parent shall bear thirty
percent (30%) of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
Seller shall bear the other seventy percent (70%) of such fees, costs and
expenses.

 

(e) If the Final Closing Payment is less than the Estimated Closing Payment,
Seller shall pay to Buyer Parent the total amount of such deficit, and if the
Final Closing Payment exceeds the Estimated Closing Payment, Buyer Parent
shall pay to Seller the total amount of such excess, in either case by wire
transfer of immediately available U.S. dollar funds to an account designated
by the Party receiving payment, within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Payment.

(f) Buyers and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 3.3_ shall be allocated in a manner consistent with any allocation
agreed to pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 

3.4. _Allocation_. Buyers and Seller shall allocate the Purchase Price, plus
any Liabilities assumed or taken subject to and treated as consideration for
federal income tax purposes and any other amounts treated as consideration for
federal income tax purposes (such aggregate amount, the " _Allocable Amount_
"), between (i) the Conveyed Equity Interests, on the one hand, and (ii) the
Acquired Assets other than the Conveyed Equity Interests, on the other hand.
The portion of the Allocable Amount described in clause (ii) shall then be
allocated among each of the Acquired Assets (other than the Conveyed Equity
Interests) (together with the allocation to the Conveyed Equity Interests
described in clause (i), the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase
Price Allocation shall be reasonable and, with respect to the portion of
the Allocable Amount described in clause (ii), shall be prepared in
accordance with the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyers shall
prepare and deliver to Seller the Purchase Price Allocation within thirty (30)
days of the final determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_, and revised copies from time to time to report any
matters that need updating. All Tax Returns and reports filed by Buyers and
Seller shall be prepared consistently with the Purchase Price Allocation or,
if applicable, any update thereto. The Purchase Price Allocation shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto, unless, within ten (10) calendar days
after the date of receipt by Seller, Seller delivers to Buyer a written
request for changes. If Seller delivers such a request, then Buyers and Seller
shall undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised in such request
within thirty (30) calendar days. If the parties cannot reach a resolution,
then Seller and Buyers shall cause the Accounting Firm to review and determine
the correct treatment of the item or items in dispute. The cost of the
Accounting Firms review and determination shall be allocated fifty percent
(50%) to Seller and fifty percent (50%) to Buyers. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties. Buyers and Seller
shall promptly notify the other Party in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the allocation of
the Purchase Price.

 



35

    

3.5. _No Withholding_. Buyers shall not deduct or withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement.

_however_ , that any such disclosure against any section or subsection of
this _Article V_ shall be deemed to be a disclosure against each of the other
sections and subsections of this _Article V_ to the extent the applicability

apparent on the face of such disclosure), and (b) as disclosed in the Seller
SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2017 (other than any disclosures
contained in the "Forward Looking Statements" or "Risk Factors" sections of

where the relevance of the information as an exception to (or disclosure for
purposes of) a particular representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyers,
as follows:

 

5.1. _Seller_ __ _s Organization and Good Standing; Authority and
Enforceability_.

 

(a) Seller and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries (i) is a limited liability

recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except with respect to _clause (iii)_
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect. Seller has previously furnished to Buyer Parent a true and complete
copy of the Organizational Documents of Seller and each of the Transferred
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended as of the date of this Agreement, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect and no other amendments
thereto have been approved by Seller. Neither Seller nor any Transferred

contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by Seller of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a party
and each certificate and other instrument required to be executed and

Seller has approved this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements to which
Seller is or will be a party and the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreements to which

 Seller is or will be a party or to consummate the Transactions on the terms
set forth herein and therein.

 

(c) This Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements to which Seller is or
will be a party and each certificate and other instrument required to be
executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto or thereto has been (or will be)
duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other Persons party thereto,
constitutes (or will constitute) a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject in
each case to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other
similar Laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors, and to general principles of equity.

5.2. _JV Equity Interests; Conveyed Equity Interests; Capital Structure_.

(a) _Section 5.2(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the

a Transferred Subsidiary (as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule) owns of record and beneficially all such JV Equity
Interests, free and clear of all Liens, other than those imposed under
applicable securities laws. Except as set forth in the Organizational

Disclosure Schedule sets forth the outstanding equity interests (the "
_Conveyed Equity Interests_ ") of the Transferred Subsidiaries which are owned

Subsidiaries and no equity interests of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries

assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations 

 



42

    

 contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through _(ii)_ of _subsection_ _(b)_ below

except, in the case of the preceding _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ , for any
such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and
the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation by
Seller of the Transactions, do not and will not require Seller or any
Transferred Subsidiary to obtain any consent, approval, Order, authorization
or permit of, action or waiver by, or to make any filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) the filings required under the
HSR Act, and (ii) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action,
filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not (A)
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay Seller from performing
its obligations under this Agreement or consummating the Transactions or (B),
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect.

5.4. _Absence of Litigation_. Except for those that would, not individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, (a) there is no Action pending
against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any

hereof, as of the date of such amendment or superseding filing), none of the
Seller SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Solely as it relates to the Business, the audited consolidated financial
statements of Seller (including any related notes thereto) included in
Sellers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017 filed with the SEC have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on

relates to the Business, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
Seller (including any related notes thereto) for all interim periods included
in Sellers Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC since December
31, 2017 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent

liabilities and obligations (a) reflected or reserved against in the Business

 



44

    

 Financial Statements, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business since

state of circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, has had a
Business Material Adverse Effect and (c) there has not been any action taken
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, that, if taken during the period from

the consent of Buyer Parent under, _Sections_ _7.2(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_
, _(g)_ , _(j)_ , _(k)_ or _(l)_.

 

5.9. _Compliance with Laws_.

to the Knowledge of Seller, the Joint Ventures are, and since January 1, 2018
have been, in material compliance with all Laws applicable to the Business,
any of the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, except where any non-
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to be material to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. Except with respect to Environmental Laws (which are the subject
of _Section_ __ _ 5.13_), Seller and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, the Joint Ventures, have been and are in compliance with all
applicable Permits necessary for them to own, lease or operate the Acquired
Assets and to carry on the Business as now conducted, except for any Permits
the absence of, or noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business or the
Acquired Assets. Since January 1, 2018, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any Joint Venture, has
received any warning letter or other notice from any Governmental Authority
alleging any material violation or potential material violation by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture of any Law that is applicable to

of Seller or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any Joint
Venture is in material default with respect to any Order applicable to the
Business, any Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

 



45

    

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the Joint
Ventures hold all Permits necessary for Seller and its Subsidiaries and the
Joint Ventures to own, lease or operate the Acquired Assets and to carry on
the Business as now conducted, except for any Permits the absence of, or
noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to materially affect the Business as currently conducted or
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. All such Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially affect the Business as currently conducted or materially impair or
materially delay the Closing. Seller has not received any written
notification of a suspension, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse
modification of any Permits of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any Joint Venture, and to the Knowledge of Seller no
such suspension, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification is
pending. To the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred which permits, or
upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would
permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or
termination of any Permits that are currently in effect, in each case, the
loss of which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to materially affect the Business as currently conducted or materially impair
or materially delay the Closing. Neither Seller, nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any Joint Venture has received written notice
within the past three (3) years of any investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Business, any of the Acquired
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, other than investigations or reviews (x)
conducted in connection with ordinary license renewal procedures of the
Business and/or (y) the outcome of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. To the Knowledge of
Seller, no investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Governmental
Authority indicated in writing any intention to conduct the same, other than
investigations or reviews (x) conducted in connection with ordinary license
renewal procedures of the Business and/or (y) the outcome of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or materially delay the Closing.

5.10. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Solely as it relates to the Business, all material income and other
material Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed by or on behalf
of Seller or, to the Knowledge of Seller, by or on behalf of any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, have been timely filed in accordance with all
applicable Laws (after giving effect to any extensions of time in which to
make such filings), and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects. Solely as it relates to the Business, there is no

Return or may be subject to Tax.

Disclosure Schedule constitute the entire agreement between Seller and its
Subsidiaries (as applicable), on the one hand, and the applicable landlord,
sublandlord or tenant (as applicable), on the other hand, with respect to the

complete list of all Transferred IP that is Registered IP (the " _Business

by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries 

 



56

    

 has received any written notice or claim challenging the validity or
enforceability of any Business Registered IP that remains pending or
unresolved. All Business Registered IP is subsisting and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, to the extent registered or issued, valid and enforceable.

(b) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
steps to maintain the confidentiality and enforceability of all Trade Secrets
included within the Transferred IP, including taking commercially reasonable
steps to safeguard any such information that is accessible through computer
systems or networks. To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no
misappropriation of, unauthorized access to, use of, modification of, or
breach of security relating to, Trade Secrets included within the Transferred
IP.

 

(c) Seller and its Subsidiaries own, license, or otherwise have a valid and
enforceable right to use all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property
Rights that are material to the Business as currently conducted. The
consummation of the Transactions will not alter or impair the ownership or
licensing of, or impact the validity of or any rights to use, such
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights on substantially the
same terms and conditions. The Business as currently conducted, and as
conducted in the past three (3) years, does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights
of any Third Party. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any
notice or claim since January 1, 2018 that a Third Party is misappropriating,
infringing or otherwise violating any Transferred IP and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, no Third Party is misappropriating, infringing or otherwise violating
any Transferred IP. No Transferred IP is subject to any outstanding Order,
judgment, decree, agreement, or stipulation restricting or limiting any
use or licensing thereof by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) Seller or its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right, title
and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce) the Transferred
IP, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and have not
granted any license, covenant, release, immunity or other right with respect
to any Transferred IP to any Person other than non-exclusive licenses granted
in the ordinary course of business in connection with marketing and
promotional activities.

 

(e) Seller and each Subsidiary has, with respect to the Business, (i) complied
in all material respects with its respective privacy policies and all
applicable Laws relating to privacy and data security, including with respect
to the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure and use of
Personal Information, and (ii) implemented and maintained a data
security plan which maintains effective and commercially reasonable
administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the Transferred
IP and Personal Information against loss, damage and unauthorized access, use
modifications or other misuse. There has been no material loss, damage or
unauthorized access, use, modification or breach of security of the
Transferred IP or Personal Information maintained by or on behalf of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business. Since January 1, 2014,
no Person (including any Governmental Authority) has made any claim or
commenced any action with respect to loss, damage or unauthorized access, use,
modification or breach of security of Personal Information maintained by
or on behalf of the Business. Neither the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions will, or reasonably
would be expected to, result in any violation of any privacy policy of the
Business or any applicable Law pertaining to privacy, data security or
Personal Information.

 



57

    

(f) To the Knowledge of Seller, the Intellectual Property within the
Transferred IP does not contain any viruses, material bugs, worm, trap door,
back door, Trojan horse, time bomb, drop dead device, vulnerabilities, faults
or other devices or effects, that reasonably would be expected to materially
impair the operation of such Intellectual Property or to enable or assist any
Person to access without authorization such Intellectual Property or any data
or information in such Intellectual Property. Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries periodically reviews patches, updates and hotfixes offered or
recommended by Sellers third-party developers or suppliers of Intellectual
Property and deploys such patches, updates and hotfixes that Seller believes
are commercially prudent. Seller and each of its Subsidiaries has
commercially reasonable disaster recovery plans, procedures and facilities in
place that are designed to minimize the disruption of its business in the
event of any material failure of Intellectual Property.

and deliver any additional certificates and other instruments that are
necessary or required to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purpose and intent of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

 

8.2. _Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities under antitrust or competition
Laws (including those in connection with the HSR Act) (the " _Competition
Approvals_ ").

 

(b) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions or if any
action is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging the Transactions in connection with the Competition
Approvals, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly resolve such objections and actions; provided, that in no event shall
Buyer Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates be obligated to
take any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate
order or other arrangement, that (i) requires the sale, divestiture, licensing
or disposition of (x) any assets or businesses of Buyer

 



68

    

 Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (y) any assets of
the Business, (ii) limits the conduct of Buyers or their Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiaries) or Buyer
Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the
Acquired Assets, the Business, the Joint Ventures or any portion thereof or
any of Buyer Parents or its Affiliates other assets or businesses, or (iii)
would be expected to have an adverse impact on Buyer Parent, its Affiliates

Governmental Authority, Seller shall not, without Buyer Parents prior written
consent, which may be withheld by Buyer Parent in its sole discretion, take,
or commit to take, any action inconsistent with the limitations set forth in
the preceding sentence. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to
take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations in
connection with obtaining all Competition Approvals, unless the effectiveness
of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(c) Each of the Parties shall furnish to each other Party such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating
to the exchange of information, outside counsel for Seller and Buyer Parent
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Seller or Buyers, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials

to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
shall provide the other Party and its counsel with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to the matters in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Buyer Parent shall in any event control the strategy and
process relating to all Competition Approvals so long as Buyer
Parent reasonably consults in advance with Seller and considers in good faith
the views of Seller with respect thereto. In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the previous sentence, Seller shall agree with any Governmental
Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or other Competition Approvals, as requested by Buyer Parent.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make or
cause to be made all required HSR Act notifications within thirty (30) days

Parent. If Seller or Buyer Parent receives a request for information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions (including, but not limited to, such requests with respect to
the HSR Act), then such Party shall in good faith make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
Parties, a response which is, at a minimum, in substantial compliance with
such request.

_Article XI_ , Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i)
provide to Buyer Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during
Sellers normal business hours, in such a manner as not to interfere

notice to Seller, to the Business Real Property and to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries that are primarily related to the Business (but only to the
extent applicable to the Business) and to the books and records thereof
(including for purposes of conducting non-invasive environmental assessments)
and (ii) reasonably promptly furnish such information concerning the
properties (including the Business Real Property), Contracts, assets and
liabilities primarily related to the Business as Buyer Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
Seller shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that Seller
reasonably believes that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege (but Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege), or (B) breach, contravene or violate any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the Parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any information that is
withheld pursuant to clause (A) or (B) to be provided or made available in a
manner that is not prohibited by clause (A) or (B)) and (y) without the prior
written consent of Seller (which may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion),
Buyers shall not contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the Business.

Sellers sole discretion), the rights of access set forth in this _Section_ __

(v) such Party becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the End Date the
consummation of the Transactions or that would reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.3_ being incapable of satisfaction;  _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall
not be a breach or default hereunder, and Seller shall have no liability
therefor, if Seller shall fail to provide any notice in respect of the matters
addressed in clauses (iii) or (iv). The making of such a notice (in and of
itself), the providing of any Specified Schedule Information or the updating
of any Schedule to this Agreement or _Section_ __ _ 5.22(d)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall not affect
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this

 



70

    

 Agreement or any Transaction Agreement and any failure to make such notice
(in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ have been satisfied or give
rise to any right of termination set forth in _Article XI_.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith in
connection with the preparation of any updates which may be necessary or
appropriate to the Schedules containing certain Acquired Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Business Employees (such facts, conditions, occurrences,

_Specified Schedule Information_ "); _provided, however_ , that any such
updates to the Schedules of the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or
the Business Employees to include or otherwise reflect such Specified Schedule
Information shall be subject to the review of, and shall require the prior
written consent of, each Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Prior to the Closing, Seller agrees that it will use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the Schedules of the Acquired Assets, Assumed
Liabilities and Business Employees to include any Specified Schedule
Information arising after the date hereof. At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer Parent an updated assessment of the (x) FRA Reserve Amount
and (y) the FRA Accrual Amount, in each case, as of the end of the last

(e) From and after the Closing, upon the request of Buyer Parent, Seller shall
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent accounting
firm to deliver to the SEC any auditors consent that is required to be
included in any filing with the SEC that includes or incorporates by reference
the financial statements of the Business prepared by Seller and (ii) to the
extent Buyer Parent conducts or intends to conduct an offering of securities
(and if the registration statement, prospectus or offering memorandum for such
offering includes or incorporates by reference the financial statements
of the Business prepared by Seller), use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its independent accounting firm to deliver a letter containing
statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants
"comfort letters" with respect to the financial statements of the Business
prepared by Seller contained or incorporated by reference in any such document
relating to any such offering, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii)
above, within the period reasonably requested by Buyer Parent. Any fees and
expenses owed to such accounting firm as a result of sub-clause (ii) in the
previous sentence shall be paid by Buyer Parent. In addition, in
connection with any SEC filing required to be made by Buyer Parent (or any
SEC review of such filing), Seller shall permit Buyers and their authorized
Representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records of
Seller and its Subsidiaries primarily relating to the Business for the purpose
of preparing any such SEC filing or responding to SEC questions,

 



76

    

 comments or requests on such SEC filing, and to direct their Representatives
to cooperate fully in such preparation or response.

 

(f) Buyer Parent agrees to reimburse Seller, following the delivery by Seller

information delivered to Buyer Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.11(g)_.

 

8.12. _Payoff Letters and Lien Releases_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer Parent and the Title Company customary payoff letters in
connection with the repayment of the Seller Business Indebtedness and the
release of all Liens in connection therewith, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer Parent (the " _Payoff Letters_ "),
and make arrangements for the "lenders" under the applicable Seller Business
Indebtedness to deliver, subject to the receipt of the applicable payoff
amounts, customary Lien releases and any original possessory collateral held
by the holders of such Seller Business Indebtedness.

8.13. _Seller Guarantees_. Buyers shall cooperate as reasonably requested by

release of all bonds, security, credit support, parent guarantees, letters of
credit and indemnifications given by Seller and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Acquired Assets and set forth on _Section_ __ _ 8.13_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and, to effectuate such return or release,
Buyers shall, to the extent required, post its own bonds, security, credit
support, parent guarantees, letters of credit, indemnifications and other
items of value in substitution therefor on similar terms as such released
bonds, guarantees and indemnifications. If, notwithstanding Buyers compliance
with the foregoing sentence, any such bonds, security, credit support, parent
guarantees, letters of credit or indemnifications remain outstanding following
the Closing, Buyers shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries from and against all losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with such bonds, security, credit support, parent guarantees,
letters of credit or indemnifications.

 

8.14. _Affiliate Transactions_.

of Seller or its Subsidiaries, or any immediate family member of, or Person
who, to the Knowledge of Seller, is controlled by, any

 



77

    

 such Person, on the other hand, shall be terminated by Seller without cost
or continuing liability of the Business or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
and shall be of no further force or effect, and there shall be no further

the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.14_ shall not apply in
respect of any Contracts that are Excluded Assets under this Agreement.

counsel, such fees to be reimbursed by Buyer Parent shall not
exceed $2,500,000, unless reasonably established by Seller that the cost of
outside counsel to assist Seller in complying with the Second Request exceeds
such amount.

 

ARTICLE IX.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

9.1. _Employment Offers_.

 

(a) Buyers or a designated Subsidiary of Buyers shall offer employment or
service to each Business Employee disclosed on  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(d)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (other than Business Employees employed by
Transferred Subsidiaries, who shall remain employed by such Transferred
Subsidiaries), as updated by the Parties prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_: (x) who is actively employed on the
Closing Date or who is temporarily absent from active employment due to
vacation or paid time off, effective as of the Closing Date, or (y) who is
temporarily absent from active employment due to disability or military leave
on the Closing Date, upon termination of such temporary absence within six (6)
months following the Closing Date, provided that such individual is able to
perform the essential functions of the position (with or without reasonable
accommodation) he or she previously held with Seller (or a Subsidiary of
Seller) prior to such absence (the " _Offered Employees_ "). Those Business
Employees who accept employment or service from Buyers or one of their
Subsidiaries pursuant to the offers of employment or service made pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and commence employment or service with Buyers
or one of their Subsidiaries shall be referred to herein collectively as "
_Transferred Employees_ ". Seller shall provide all reasonable

 



78

    

 assistance to Buyers and their Subsidiaries in connection with the offers of
employment or service to the Offered Employees contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 9.1_.

 

(b) The offer of employment provided under _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ to Offered
Employees shall provide for compensation and benefits that, taken as a whole,
have a value that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation and benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer
Parent and its Subsidiaries, or provided to such Offered Employee immediately
prior to the Closing.

9.2. _Seller_ __ _s Termination of Transferred Employees and Payment of Pre-
Closing Compensation and Benefits_. Seller shall terminate the employment of
Offered Employees who become Transferred Employees effective on the Closing
Date, and Seller shall pay to the Transferred Employees any and all
Liabilities (other than severance) relating to or arising out of their
employment or termination of employment, including any payments due such
Transferred Employees pursuant to accrued wages, salary, bonus, or other forms
of compensation, except for Assumed PTO and benefits that are not otherwise
immediately payable under Transferred Employee Benefit Plans, as set forth in
_Schedule 9.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

9.3. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Buyers shall cause the Transferred Employees service with Seller (or any
Subsidiary of Seller) as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.22(d)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule to be recognized under the benefit plans made available by
Buyers or their Affiliates to the Transferred Employees (" _Buyer Benefit
Plans_ ") for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting (excluding equity compensation) and, to the extent applicable,
entitlement to vacation and sick leave, to the same extent such service is
recognized under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plans; _provided_ that
such service need not be recognized or credited (i) to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) with
respect to a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into
account or with respect to any equity-based compensation, or (iii) to the
extent that such recognition would result in benefit accruals with respect to
any defined benefit plan. Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all applicable Buyer Benefit Plans that provide medical, vision, and
dental insurance coverage (collectively, " _Buyer Welfare Plans_ ") to waive
pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability provisions and
waiting period requirements to the same extent such exclusions, provisions and
requirements were waived or satisfied under the applicable employer welfare
plan as of the Closing Date. In addition, Buyers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Buyer Welfare Plans to credit
Transferred Employees with amounts credited by Seller medical, dental and
vision insurance coverage toward the satisfaction of annual deductible and
out-of-pocket maximums under such Buyer health, dental and vision coverage
during the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 

(b) Seller, its Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for complying with COBRA with respect to their employees and
their eligible dependents (other than the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents) by reason of such employees termination of employment
with Seller, its Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates, and neither Buyers
nor any Affiliate thereof shall have any obligation or liability to provide
COBRA benefits on account of any such termination of employment. Buyers and
their

 



79

    

 Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be solely responsible for complying with
COBRA with respect to the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents.

 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyers shall or shall cause
their Affiliates to assume each Transferred Employees unused vacation time
earned as of the Closing Date with Seller (or any Subsidiary of Seller) but
only to the extent set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.22(d)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (" _Assumed PTO_ ").

 

(d) To the extent that the Sellers 2019 Management Incentive Plan (the "
_2019 MIP_ ") is a Transferred Employee Benefit Plan as of Closing, Buyers
shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) assume and honor the 2019 MIP
and all obligations to pay any amounts thereunder in accordance with its
terms, and (ii) pay incentives to the Transferred Employees in an aggregate
amount not less than the accrued amount in respect of the 2019 MIP that is
taken into account in the calculation of Working Capital.

 

9.4. _WARN_. Seller and its Affiliates shall comply with all notification
requirements arising under the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act
of 1988 and any similar state, local or foreign Law (" _WARN_ ") in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such
obligations arise during the Interim Period. Buyers and their Affiliates
shall comply with all notification requirements arising under WARN in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent
such obligations arise on or after the Closing Date.

 

9.5. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
all provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or any other provision of this
Agreement with respect to Business Employees are included for the sole benefit
of the Parties and shall not create any right (a) in any other Person,
including any Business Employees, any participant in any Employee Benefit
Plan or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, (b) to continued employment,
either before or after the Closing, with Seller, Buyers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or (c) to be construed to modify, amend or establish
any benefit plan, program or arrangement or in any way affect the ability of
the Parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of
its benefit plans or programs.

 

ARTICLE X.

TAX MATTERS 

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyers and Seller for certain Tax matters:

 

10.1. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyers and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Article X_ and any audit, litigation, refund claim or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes (each, a " _Tax Proceeding_ "). Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyers and Seller agree to retain all books and

 



80

    

 records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Assets
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until sixty
(60) days following the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority.

 

(b) Buyers and Seller further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party
with all information that either Party may be required to report pursuant to
Section 6043A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

payment of fifty percent (50%) of any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and similar Taxes and administrative fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (together,
" _Transfer Taxes_ ").

10.3. _Tax Characterization of Payments Under this Agreement_. Seller
and Buyers agree to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of
the other Party under this Agreement (other than payment of the Purchase
Price) as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof to the extent permitted under
applicable Tax Law.

ARTICLE XI.

 

PRE-CLOSING TERMINATION

 

11.1. _Pre-Closing Termination_. Subject to the terms of this  _Section_ __ _
11.1_, this Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer Parent and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on
the End Date;

(c) by either Buyer Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, if:

 

(i) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued or promulgated a Law
that has the effect of rendering the Transactions illegal; or

(ii) a Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order prohibiting the
Transactions that has become final and nonappealable;

_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_ shall not be available to a Party if the issuance
of, or failure to resolve or have vacated or lifted, such Order was primarily
due to a breach by such party of any of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

(d) by Buyer Parent ( _provided_ that Buyers are not then in material breach
of this Agreement), if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller set forth in this Agreement such
that the conditions set forth in _Sections 4.3(b)(i)_ or _(ii)_  

 



81

    

 would not be satisfied at such time and such breach has not been cured
within twenty (20) Business Days after written notice thereof to Seller; or

 

(e) by Seller ( _provided_ that Seller is not then in material breach of this
Agreement), if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Buyers set forth in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 4.3(c)(i)_ or _(ii)_ would not be satisfied
at such time and such breach (x) is a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(i)_
or (y) has not been cured within twenty (20) Business Days after written
notice thereof to Buyers.

 

11.2. _Effect of Pre-Closing Termination_. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _
11.1_, this Agreement shall thereupon and forthwith become void and of no
further force or effect whatsoever, and there shall be no Liability or
obligation on the part of Buyers, Seller or its respective Affiliates or
Representatives in connection herewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any Party from Liability resulting from or arising
out of any willful and intentional breach of such Partys representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein or the requirement to
make the payments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.3_, or impair the right of
any Party to compel specific performance by the other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided further_ that the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 8.11(d)_ (Reimbursement for Preparation of Carve-
Out Financial Statements), _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ (Confidentiality), _Section_
__ _ 8.7_ (Public Statements), this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, _Section_ __ _
11.3_ and _Article XIII_  shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement under the terms of _Section_ __ _ 11.1_.

 

11.3. _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated either by Seller or Buyer
Parent (i) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_, if the relevant Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, or Law preventing
or making illegal the consummation of the Transaction relates to a failure to
obtain the necessary clearances, approvals or authorizations under the HSR
Act or any foreign antitrust or competition Law set forth on _Section_ __ _
4.3(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (ii) pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 11.1(b)_ and at the time of such termination the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)(i)_ remain unsatisfied, then Buyer Parent shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
a non-refundable fee in the amount of $25,000,000 (the " _Buyer Parent
Termination Fee_ ") no later than ten (10) Business Days after such valid
termination;  _provided_ , that if Buyer Parent has previously paid the
Deposit Amount to Seller pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of "End
Date", then Seller shall be deemed to have received the full amount of the
Buyer Parent Termination Fee for all purposes under this Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii)
the Buyer Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in
which the Buyer Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, (iii) without these agreements, Buyers and Seller would not
enter into this Agreement, and (iv) in no event shall Buyer Parent be required
to 

 



82

    

 pay the Buyer Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the event
that Buyer Parent shall fail to pay the Buyer Parent Termination Fee when due,
Buyer Parent shall reimburse Seller for all reasonable costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by Seller (including reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel) in connection with any action taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in the Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid to the date of actual payment.

 

(c) Subject to the Parties rights to specifically enforce the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.6_ prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement, but notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers right to receive payment of the Buyer Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Deposit Amount if previously paid), together with the rights under
_Section_ __ _ 8.16_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller or any
of its respective Affiliates against Buyers or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members or
representatives for any and all Losses that may be suffered based upon,
resulting from or arising out of such termination, and upon payment of the
Buyer Parent Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_,
none of Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members or representatives shall have any
further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any of the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions.

12.2(a)(ii)_ or (b)(ii) to the extent that any claim for indemnification is
the subject of a specific reserve or accrual reflected or included in the
Business Financial Statements or Seller Business Indebtedness and (iii) there
shall be no obligation to indemnify for any Loss under  _Section_ __ _ 12.2_
to the extent that such Loss was taken into account under _Article III_.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in the event that a particular matter
entitles a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to more than
one clause of _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)_ or pursuant to any other Transaction
Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover a
particular dollar of Losses associated with such matter only once under this
_Article XII_ and the Transaction Agreements, and (ii) in the event that a
particular matter entitles a Seller Indemnified Party to indemnification
pursuant to more than one clause of _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_ or pursuant to
any other Transaction Agreement, Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover a particular dollar of Losses associated with such matter only once
under this _Article XII_ and the Transaction Agreements.

(e) Buyer Parent and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to resolving
any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to
indemnify the other party under this _Article XII_ , including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses, whether by seeking
claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise, and to resolve any such
claim or liability.

 

12.4. _Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may have a right
to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in a
written notice (a " _Claim Certificate_ "), prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period (if applicable): (i) stating that such Indemnified
Party has suffered or incurred any Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it
will suffer or incur any Losses, for which it is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement; (ii) a brief description in reasonable detail (to the
extent available to such Indemnified Party) of the facts, circumstances or
events giving rise to each item of Losses based on such Indemnified Partys
good faith belief thereof and the amount of all related Losses; and (iii) the
basis for indemnification under this Agreement to which such item of Losses is
related.

(b) If a Buyer becomes aware of a claim to be indemnified by Seller as a
result of the breach of any representation and warranty made by Seller in
_Section_ __ _ 5.22(b)_ hereof, such Buyer shall notify Seller of such breach
and, following Sellers receipt of such notice, Seller (if it agrees that
such breach has occurred) may elect to cure any such breach by undertaking to,
or

 



86

    

 causing any of its Affiliates to, transfer additional assets to Buyer or its
designated Affiliates, as applicable, grant perpetual, royalty-free licenses
or sub-licenses to additional Intellectual Property to Buyer or its
designated Affiliates under an appropriate license, as applicable, or
otherwise take other commercially reasonable actions to remedy such breach.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.4(b)_
shall in no way prejudice or limit any of Buyers rights or remedies under
this _Article XII_ at any time (except to the extent that a Loss is actually
reduced or eliminated by Sellers actions under this _Section_ __ _
12.4(b))._

12.5. _Third Party Claims_. In the event any claim, demand, complaint or
Action is instituted by a third party against an Indemnified Party which
involves or appears reasonably likely to involve an Indemnification Claim
hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly
after receipt of notice of any such Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement thereof; _provided, however_ , that the failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any such Third Party
Claim shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party except to the
extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to control the defense or settlement of such Third Party
Claim and may elect to retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to
the relevant Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties
in connection with such Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees, charges and
disbursements of such counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 12.5_:

 

(a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Party (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the
foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of an actual and material conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim), and the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Partys counsel in connection with such Third
Party Claim;

 

(b) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if: (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or
(iii) the amount of Losses reasonably estimated to be incurred pursuant to
such Third Party Claim (when combined with all other outstanding claims for
indemnification and any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party that
applies toward the applicable cap under _Section_ __ _ 12.3_ (if any) would
exceed the applicable cap contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 12.3_ (if any));
_provided_ _that_ the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
(but not control) the defense of such Third Party Claim (and any and all
settlement discussions related to such Third Party Claim) and to employ, at
its sole expense, separate counsel of its choice to advise the Indemnifying
Party for such purpose;

 



87

    

(c) if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may not settle or otherwise resolve such claim
or cease to defend such claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (i) prior to the Indemnifying Party entering
into such settlement or ceasing to defend such claim, the Indemnifying Party
first verifies to the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for all Liabilities and obligations relating to such
Third Party Claim, (ii) such settlement or cessation involves, with respect to
the Indemnified Party, only the payment of a lump sum amount of money and the
Indemnifying Party pays such lump sum amount of money when due, and (iii)
such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party
from all Liabilities with respect to such claim;

 

(d) in the event the Indemnified Party controls the defense of any Third Party
Claim, it shall request the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend such
claim. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability
in connection with any settlement of any Third Party Claim that is
entered into by the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);

(e) from and after the delivery of a notice of a Third Party Claim, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnifying Party and its employees, counsel, experts and
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the Third Party Claim at no cost to the
Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Indemnified Parties); _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall take
reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege reasonably
available to an Indemnified Party in respect of any of its records; and

(f) procedures relating to Tax Proceedings shall be governed solely by
_Section X_ and not by this section.

12.6. _Tax Treatment_. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

12.7.  _Limitation of Set-Off_

(a) Buyers shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification
claim pursuant to this _Article XII_ against, and there shall not otherwise be
any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of
any obligation to make (i) any payment due pursuant to _Article III, or_ (ii)
any payment due under the Transition Services Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement other than this Agreement.

 

(b) Seller shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification
claim pursuant to this _Article XII_ against, and there shall not otherwise
be any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of
any obligation to make (i) any payment due

 



88

    

 pursuant to _Article III, or_ (ii) any payment due under the Transition
Services Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement other than this Agreement. 

12.8. _Potential Contributors_. If an Indemnified Party receives any payment
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses and the Indemnified Party
could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party based on
the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then
such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to proceed
against such third party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying Party
to recover from such third party the amount of such payment.

Any party or other recipient may from time to time change its contact
information for purposes of this Agreement by giving notice of such change as
provided herein.

13.2. _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 13.9_, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each of the Parties, or, in the case of a
waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No course of
dealing and no failure or delay on the part of any Party hereto in exercising
any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such partys rights, powers and
remedies hereunder. The failure of any of the Parties to this Agreement to
require the performance of a term or obligation under this Agreement or the
waiver by any of the Parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall
not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a
waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

13.3. _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and other
provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of either
Party shall bind and inure to the benefit

 



90

    

 of the successors, heirs and permitted assigns of such Party (if any),
whether or not so expressed. Neither Party may assign or transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent in writing of
the other Party, except that, without the consent of the other Party: (a)
Buyer Sub may assign their rights and obligations hereunder (including their
right to purchase the Acquired Assets), in whole or in part, to any
Affiliate, and (b) a Party may assign any or all of its rights pursuant to
this Agreement to any of its lenders as collateral security.

 

13.4. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not in any way be impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each Partys rights
and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

13.5. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, shall pay all of their own respective
fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel,
investment bankers, brokers and other Representatives and consultants)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation
of the Transactions. Losses suffered by a Party for a breach of this Agreement
shall in no way be limited by the amounts described in this  _Section_ __ _
13.5_.

13.6. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that (i) irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement or the
obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the Parties were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and (ii) money damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
for any such failure to perform or any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly,
it is agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court specified in _Section_ __ _ 13.11_ without proof of actual damages or
any requirement to post a bond, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity, and each Party agrees that it
shall not oppose (and hereby waives any defense in any action for) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law, in equity or otherwise.

13.7. _Other Remedies_. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

13.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth or referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or

 



91

    

 give to any Person any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement executed
in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the Parties hereto and
their successors or permitted assigns. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for
the sole benefit of the Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, and are not necessarily intended as
characterization of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any earlier date.

 

13.9. _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. In the event of any conflict between
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement shall
control.

13.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state without
giving effect to the conflicts of Laws principles thereof.

13.11. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Without limiting the other provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 13.11_, the Parties hereto agree that any legal
proceeding by or against any Party hereto or with respect to or arising out of
this Agreement shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
located within New Castle County. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court solely for the purposes of disputes
arising under this Agreement and not as a general submission to such
jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim whatsoever.
The Parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of
the aforementioned court in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of
copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such party to which
notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall be
effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. The Parties hereto
hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding under or in
connection with this Agreement brought before the foregoing court on the basis
of (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
above-named court for any reason, or that it or any of its property is immune
from the above-described legal process, (b) that such action or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court, or
(c) any other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or
collection of any amount to which any Party hereto is entitled pursuant to
any final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. The Parties agree that
the Accounting Firm shall resolve all disputes involving calculation of the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, and that the procedure
described therein shall be the sole mechanism for the resolution of any such
dispute.

13.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE 

 



92

    

 ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

13.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
Parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

13.14. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties hereto agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that no Non-Recourse Party in
respect of such Parties shall have any liability under this Agreement (it
being understood that if any individual Party hereto is a Non-Recourse Party
in respect of another individual Party hereto, this limitation shall not be
read to affect any such liability of such individual Party itself);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the obligations of
any Non-Recourse Party under any Transaction Agreement to which such Non-
Recourse Party is party, including, even if the basis for obligations
thereunder relate to or arise from obligations hereunder.
