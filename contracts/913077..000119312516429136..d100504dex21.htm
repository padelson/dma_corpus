Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties to the
Merger Agreement made to and solely for the benefit of each other and only as
of specific dates. The assertions embodied in Affymetrix and Thermo Fishers
representations and warranties are qualified by and subject to limitations
agreed upon by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the
Merger Agreement, including information contained in confidential disclosure
schedules that each party provided to the other in connection with the Merger

Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be reflected in the
parties public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone,

8 _ARTICLE 2_

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in Menlo Park, California at the offices of Davis
Polk and Wardwell LLP, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025 as soon
as possible, but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days after the
date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  



9 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c)
or Section 2.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 per Share in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares in an
Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other
than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation
such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of
Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c)).

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than
five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



10 (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share, without interest. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates, Uncertificated
Shares, or any other securities pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
and Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Exchange
Agent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



11 __Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, and the holders of such
Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands. __

Section 2.05. _Equity Awards_.

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each option to purchase
Shares outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock Option")
that is fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Vested
Company Stock Option") shall terminate and cease to represent a right to
acquire Shares, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive therefor
an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares that were
purchasable upon exercise of such Vested Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(y) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
of such Vested Company Stock Option, which amount shall be payable as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (but not later than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter in any event); and (ii) each Company Stock Option that is not
fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (an "Unvested
Company Stock Option") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an award
(an "Assumed Option") representing a right to receive a cash amount equal to
the product of (x) the number of Shares underlying the Unvested Company Stock
Option that would have become purchasable upon each future vesting date of
such Unvested Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the excess (if any) of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Unvested Company
Stock Option (the "Assumed Option Merger Consideration"). For the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise
price greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no
consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The right to
receive the Assumed Option Merger Consideration in respect of an Assumed
Option shall be subject to the vesting terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, the award agreements evidencing the corresponding Unvested Company Stock
Option and Section 6.1(c) of the Change of Control Plan, in each case, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such Assumed Option Merger
Consideration shall be payable as soon as practicable following the applicable
vesting dates (but not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any
event). For purposes of clarity, with respect to any Assumed Options held by a
non-employee member of the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, as a
result of his or her cessation of service as of the Effective Time,
the Assumed Option shall immediately vest and such director shall be entitled
to be paid the Assumed Option Merger Consideration as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time (but no later than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter in any event).

 



12 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share unit
with respect to Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan, including those
units subject to performance criteria (each such unit, whether or not
performance-based, a "Company RSU"), that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an award (an "Assumed RSU") representing a right to receive a
cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares that would have
been delivered to the holder on each future vesting date of such Company RSU
(or on each future delivery date of such Company RSU, if such delivery date is
later than the related vesting date), multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration (the "Assumed RSU Merger Consideration"), and such Assumed RSU
Merger Consideration shall be payable as soon as practicable after the
applicable vesting date or delivery date applicable to the Assumed RSU (but
not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any event). The right to
receive any Assumed RSU Merger Consideration in respect of Assumed RSUs shall
be subject to the vesting and delivery terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, the award agreements evidencing the corresponding Company RSU and
Section 6.1(c) of the Change of Control Plan, in each case, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , the
performance metrics relating to Company RSUs that , immediately prior to the
Effective Time, remain subject to the achievement of such performance metrics
(such Company RSUs, the "Company PSUs") shall be deemed to have been achieved
at target as of the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, with respect to
any Assumed RSUs held by a non-employee member of the Board of Directors as of
the date hereof, as a result of his or her cessation of service as of the
Effective Time, the Assumed RSU shall immediately vest and such director
shall be entitled to be paid the Assumed RSU Merger Consideration as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but no later than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter in any event).

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan)
shall adopt resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents or take any
other actions as are necessary to provide for the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.05.

 



13 (d) The Company shall ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the ESPP
will commence during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll
deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the
current offering periods, except those made in accordance with payroll
deduction elections that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and
(iii) no individuals shall commence participation in the ESPP during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time. The
accumulated contributions of the participants in the current offering periods
shall be used to purchase Shares as of no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, and the participants purchase rights under such
offerings shall terminate immediately after such purchase. As of no later than
the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate the ESPP.

 

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares or similar transaction, or stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any
change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date
hereof to purchase Shares granted under the Companys stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Article 2 such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts and remits such amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Assumed
Options, Company RSUs or Assumed RSUs, as applicable in respect of which the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

be submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders, each of which
resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way as of
the date of this Agreement.

(c) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares, voting together as a single class (the "Company

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



16 __Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery

rule of Nasdaq or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and (v) any
actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

 

 __Section 4.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Company Charter or
bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach
of any provision of any Applicable Law, except as would not materially delay
or materially impair the Companys ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their properties or assets or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with
only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



17 Section 4.05. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 200,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of preferred

Directors. As of the date hereof, the "Conversion Rate" (as defined in the
Indenture) is 170.0319 Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible
Securities. Except as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, from and after the date of the Indenture, no event or circumstance
has occurred that has resulted in any adjustment to, and neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has taken any action that has required (or will
require) any adjustment to, or authorized any adjustment to, the Conversion
Price or the Conversion Rate (each as defined in the Indenture) of the
Convertible Securities. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any Company

2016 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such
date, settlement of Company RSUs outstanding on such date or conversion of
Convertible Securities outstanding on such date, there are no issued, reserved

securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (ii) securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants,

referred to collectively as the "Company Securities").

 



18 (c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05, none of (i) the Shares or (ii)
Company Securities are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company.

(d) There are no stockholder agreements or voting trusts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Securities, or granting any preemptive rights, subscription
rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with
respect to any Shares, except as may be required pursuant to the terms of the
Convertible Securities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar

jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All Subsidiaries of the Company and
their respective jurisdictions of organization are set forth in Section
4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

preemptive (or similar) rights and is owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any transfer restriction
(other than transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided
under the 1933 Act or other applicable securities laws). There are no issued,

its Subsidiaries convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary
of the Company, (ii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities
of, or ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into,
or exchangeable for, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted
shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights,
"phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or
provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price
of, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There
are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities, or any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive
rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any Company
Subsidiary Securities. The Company does not directly or indirectly own any
material equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or

provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any Employee Plan or (ii) result in any limitation on the right of the

transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) could give rise to the payment of any

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

Effect on the Company, all Employee Plans subject to the laws of
any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been established,
maintained and administered in all material respects in accordance with all
Applicable Laws, (ii) if they are required to be registered have been

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives or its financing sources that after the date of
this Agreement has made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited in violation of this Section 6.03 that the Board of Directors
reasonably believes could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives or its
financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which
shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third

the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ (1) such confidentiality agreement
may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction and (2) that all
such information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party) and (C) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction
orders, by nonappealable, final order, the Company to take, _provided_ , that
any such action shall have the effects, and give rise to the rights and
remedies, otherwise set forth in this Agreement;

 

(ii) subject to compliance with this Section 6.03, the Board of Directors may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(iii) subject to compliance with this Section 6.03 and the procedures set

concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal,

 



41 in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;
_provided_ , that prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that
it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal (which notice shall specify the reasons therefor in the event of an
Adverse Recommendation Change that does not relate to a Superior Proposal),
(B) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) days following
delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and considered in
good faith, and shall have made its Representatives available to discuss,
with Parents Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (C) no earlier than the end of
such four (4) day period, the Board of Directors shall have concluded, after
considering the terms of any written offer made by Parent to amend this
Agreement, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal
(or, in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change that does not relate to
a Superior Proposal, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Delaware Law) (it being understood and agreed that any change to
the financial terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above).

__In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such statement or in connection with such action. __

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.03 unless the Company shall have delivered
to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the
Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, the material terms and
conditions thereof and a copy of any written materials, proposals or agreement
received in connection therewith, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to keep Parent informed as to the status (including changes to the material
terms) of such Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis, and within 24 hours of
any developments or changes to the material terms thereof. The Company shall
also notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company of any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal.

 



42 (d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that
the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, are more favorable to the Companys stockholders than as provided
hereunder (taking into account (x) any written offer made by Parent to amend
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 6.03 and (y) all timing and any
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal).

 

(e) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request the
return or destruction of all information furnished by or on its behalf to any
such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources, and shall
enforce and not waive the provisions of its confidentiality agreements with
such Third Parties.

Section 6.04. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than ten (10) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 6.03, the
Company and the Board of Directors shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required
to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement, and each covenants that none of the information supplied or
to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date it or any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the
SEC or mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date on which the Company
learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff
has no further comments thereon. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements
thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating to
holders of Shares and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all
responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider any
comments proposed by Parent in good faith. If, at any time prior to the

 _ARTICLE 7_

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees that:

 



44 Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in
their capacity as an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the
Company Charter or bylaws of the Company or the certificate or articles of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the
applicable Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (or in
such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions, as applicable, in the Company Charter or bylaws of
the Company or the certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws or
similar organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiaries in effect on
the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, any agreement
of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



45 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are substantially
similar to the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with
respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement,
act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him
or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain
in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective
Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are substantially similar to the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall
purchase from the Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for
such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are substantially similar to those provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to (nor shall the Company)
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence or the preceding sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the current per annum amount,
which amount is set forth in Section 7.02(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; and _provided, further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.02.

 



46 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under, as applicable, the Company
Charter or bylaws of the Company or certificate or articles of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiaries,
under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.02 shall not be terminated
or modified in such manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
7.02.

(g) The Surviving Corporation shall pay on an as-incurred basis the fees and
expenses of such Indemnified Person (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the right
to indemnification, _provided_ that such Person shall undertake to reimburse
the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable order, that such Person is
not entitled to indemnification.

Section 7.03. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters._

 

(a) As of and subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) assume and
honor, employee bonus plans, change in control and severance plans and
agreements and other retention plans and agreements listed in Section 4.17(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ that nothing herein shall
prohibit Parent from amending, suspending or terminating any such plan or
arrangement to the extent permitted by its terms and Applicable Law; (ii) for
a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, provide
the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time who continue to be employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time (the
"Covered Employees") base compensation, incentive opportunities, severance
and employee benefits (including retirement, group health, life, disability,
vacation and severance plans) that are not less favorable in the aggregate to
each Covered Employee than were provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) provide
all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and levels of benefits under any employee benefit or
compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed
to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation and/or their Subsidiaries in which
Covered Employees are eligible to participate (the "Parent Plans") for all
periods of employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as such
Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Employee Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates on and after the Effective Time, _provided_  that the foregoing
shall not apply (A) for any purpose under any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree welfare plan, (B) for purposes of any Parent Plan under which
similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service, (C) for purposes of any Parent Plan that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation, or (D) to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service; (iv) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any Parent Plan to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and
their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan
in which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (v) use commercially reasonable efforts to give the
Covered Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in
which the Effective Time (or commencement of participation in a plan of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation) occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time
(or the date of commencement of participation in any Parent Plan).

 



47 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.03, the
provisions of Section 7.03(a) shall apply only with respect to Covered
Employees who are covered under Employee Plans that are maintained primarily
for the benefit of employees of the Company employed in the United States
(including Covered Employees regularly employed outside the United States to
the extent they participate in such Employee Plans). With respect to Covered
Employees not described in the preceding sentence, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws relating to employees and
employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

 

(c) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Plans that are United States Tax-
qualified defined contribution plans (collectively, the "Company DC Plan"),
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of
such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent. Upon the
distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company DC Plan to
the participants, Parent shall permit the Covered Employees who are then
actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, in the form of cash, from the Company DC Plan to the applicable
tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 



48 (d) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate, amend or modify the Client Service
Agreement between Insperity PEO Services, L.P. and the Company, effective as
of January 1, 2013 (as amended), which termination, amendment or modification
shall be effective as of no earlier than immediately prior to the Closing
Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken
in connection with the foregoing termination, amendment or modification shall
be subject to the review and approval of Parent.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any
event prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, take all action necessary to fulfill all
consultation and notification requirements, and obtain all approvals from, any
unions, works councils or other labor organizations, whether required
pursuant to Applicable Law or otherwise. Any written or oral communications to
the employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing shall be
provided in advance to Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the Company
shall cooperate, including by providing Parent a reasonable period of time to
review any such communication, in providing mutually agreeable communication.

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, the provisions of this
Section 7.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or other service provider or other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Employee Plan or any other
compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purpose, (ii) guarantee
employment for any period of time, or preclude the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason, (iii) require Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue
any Employee Plan, employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof, in accordance with the terms
thereof and applicable Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one

intentional and material breach of this Agreement, upon any termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the
Company pursuant to this Section 11.04 and such Termination Fee is paid in
full, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor
Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of
any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the

directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would
be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and
such representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The inclusion of an
item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent,
as applicable.

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of

part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; _provided_ that such

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

 



63 Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement and the letter agreement between the Company and Parent dated
December 31, 2015 constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter herein and therein and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter herein and therein.

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_ . The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any

entitled at law or in equity.

_ARTICLE VI - MISCELLANEOUS MANAGEMENT PROVISIONS_

and delivered personally or mailed to the directors or stockholders at their
addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Notice by mail shall be
deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be mailed. Notice to
directors may also be given by telegram or orally, by telephone or in
person. 

2\. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the
laws of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these By-Laws,
a written waiver of notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to said
notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. _Section 6.2. Voting of Securities Owned by the Corporation._ Subject always
to the specific directions of the Board, (a) any shares or other securities
issued by any other corporation and owned or controlled by the Corporation may
be voted in person at any meeting of security holders of such other
corporation by the President of the Corporation if he or she is present at
such meeting, or any other officer of the Corporation if he or she is present
at such meeting, and (b) whenever, in the judgment of the President or any
other officer of the Corporation, it is desirable for the Corporation to
execute a proxy or written consent in respect to any shares or other
securities issued by any other corporation and owned by the Corporation, such
proxy or consent shall be executed in the name of the Corporation by the
President or such other officer, without the necessity of any authorization by
the Board, affixation of corporate seal or countersignature or attestation by
another officer. Any person or persons designated in the manner above stated
as the proxy or proxies of the Corporation shall have full right, power and
authority to vote the shares or other securities issued by such other
corporation and owned by the Corporation the same as such shares or other
securities might be voted by the Corporation.

_ARTICLE VII - INDEMNIFICATION_

 

 _Section 7.1. Right to Indemnification._ Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter
an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while
serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as provided in Section 7.3 of this Article VII with respect to
Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board.

 

 _Section 7.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses_. The right to
indemnification conferred in Section 7.1 of this Article VII shall include
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or
is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (hereinafter an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "Final Adjudication") that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 7.2 or
otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
conferred in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article VII shall be contract rights
and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs,
executors and administrators. _Section 7.3. Right to Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section
7.1 or Section 7.2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation
within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses,
in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the Indemnitee
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such
suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In
(i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to
an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a Final Adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the
Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation
Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden
of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

 

 _Section 7.4. Non-exclusivity of Rights._ The rights to indemnification and
to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. _Section 7.5. Insurance._ The Corporation may maintain insurance, at
its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

 _Section 7.6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation._
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article VII with respect to the indemnification
and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

_ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENTS_

 

 _Section 8.1. Amendments._ These By-Laws may be amended or repealed by the
Board or by the stockholders.
