<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement has been included to provide stockholders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other
factual information about Affymetrix or Thermo Fisher. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties that the parties to the Merger Agreement made to and solely for the benefit of each other and only as of specific dates. The
assertions embodied in Affymetrix&#146; and Thermo Fisher&#146;s representations and warranties are qualified by and subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement, including
information contained in confidential disclosure schedules that each party provided to the other in connection with the Merger Agreement, were made for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties instead of establishing matters as
facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors or security holders. Accordingly, Affymetrix stockholders and other investors should not rely on
representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which
subsequent information may or may not be reflected in the parties&#146; public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Company and Thermo Fisher
that is or will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, proxy statements and other documents that the Company and Thermo Fisher file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </P>
