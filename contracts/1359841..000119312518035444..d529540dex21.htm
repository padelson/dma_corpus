proceedings are not commenced in that six month period, the Claim will not be
enforceable against the Sellers and is to be taken for all purposes to have
been withdrawn.

this clause 8.9.

similar nature arising out of the same or similar facts, matters and
circumstances will be treated as one Claim.

If the recovery is delayed until after the Claim has been paid by the Sellers
to the Buyer, the recovered sum (less all reasonable costs and expenses,
including any Tax, incurred by the Buyer or a Group Company in connection with
the recovery) will be paid to the Sellers in their Relevant Proportions into
the Payment Account) up to the amount of the Claim paid by the Sellers to the
Buyer.



     | 8.15 | Insured Claim or loss 
---|---|--- 

The Sellers will not be liable for any Claim under or in relation to this
agreement unless the Buyer has first caused the Company (or another Group
Company, as applicable) to make a Claim under any insurance policy held by the
Company (or that other Group Company) which may cover that Claim and that
Claim has been denied in whole or partly by the relevant insurer, provided
that the Buyer may still give notice of the Claim for the purposes of clause
8.8(a) once a Claim has been made under the relevant insurance policy, and
clause 8.8(b) will not apply until the Claim made under the relevant
insurance policy has been denied in whole or in part at which time (if
occurring after the time for commencing proceedings in clause 8.8(b) has
passed) the Buyer will have six months to issue or serve proceedings and, if
proceedings are not commenced in that six month period, the Claim will not be
enforceable against the Sellers. If the Buyer has still incurred some damage
or Loss (including any deductibles), that remaining amount will be the amount
of the Buyers Loss for the purposes of this agreement.



     | 8.16 | Duty to mitigate 
---|---|--- 

Each party is under a duty to use reasonable endeavours to mitigate its loss
in relation to any Claim, and the Sellers liability in respect of any breach
of any Seller Warranty or in respect of any Indemnity will be reduced or
extinguished (as the case may be) to the extent that the Buyer has failed to
so mitigate its loss. Without limitation, this clause applies to any Tax
Indemnity Claims, provided that the Buyers duty to mitigate its loss in
relation to a Claim under the Tax Indemnity or in respect of a breach of a Tax
Warranty is subject to the provisions in Schedule 5 (Tax Indemnity and Tax
Demand Claims).



     | 8.17 | No action against Officers and employees 
---|---|--- 

The Buyer waives and must procure that each of its Related Bodies Corporate
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Group Companies with effect from
Completion) (Buyer Group Member) waives all rights and Claims that it may have
personally against the current and former Officers and employees of each of
the Sellers and the Group Companies (other than against the Sellers Guarantors
in relation to the Sellers Guarantee under clause 16) in relation to any
matter arising directly or indirectly in connection with this agreement
or the Sale except to the extent that those rights or Claims arise out of the
fraud, wilful misconduct or wilful default of a current or former Officer or
employee of a Seller or a Group Company. The parties acknowledge and agree
that:

 



     | (a) | the Sellers have sought and obtained this waiver as agent
for and on behalf of their and each of their Group Companys current and
former Officers and employees and hold the benefit of this clause 8.17
as trustee for them; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the provisions of this clause 8.17 may be enforced by each
of the Sellers on behalf of and for the benefit of their and each of their
Group Companys current and former Officers and employees (other than
in respect of the Sellers Guarantors regarding the Sellers Guarantee under
clause 16) and those persons may plead this clause 8.17 in answer to any Claim
made by a Buyer Group Member against them. 
---|---|--- 
 



 

page | 23 ---|---|--- 

If payment is made for a breach of this agreement or under an Indemnity, the
payment is to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Without
limitation, this provision applies to any Tax Indemnity Claim.



     | 8.19 | Independent limitations 
---|---|--- 

Each qualification and limitation in this clause 8 is to be construed
independently of the others and is not limited by any other qualification or
limitation. Without limitation, this provision applies to any Tax Indemnity
Claim.



     | 8.20 | Damages only remedy 
---|---|--- 

If any of the Seller Warranties are incorrect, untrue or misleading, the
Buyers only remedy is in damages and the Buyer may not rescind, terminate or
revoke the agreement.



     | 8.21 | No knowledge of breach 
---|---|--- 

No member of the Buyer Deal Team:

 



     | (a) | has already formulated an intention to make a Seller
Warranty Claim; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | presently has actual knowledge (save as disclosed in the
Disclosure Material) of any circumstances which it believes may entitle it to
make a Seller Warranty Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 

For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 8.21 does not apply in respect of the
Tax Warranties or the Tax Indemnity.

 



     | 8.22 | Dishonest Conduct 
---|---|--- 

The limitations of liability set out in this clause 8 will not apply in
relation to a Seller to the extent that the Claim is in respect of the
Dishonest Conduct of that Seller.



     | 8.23 | Trustee Seller limitations 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Each of the Trustee Sellers enters into this agreement only
in its capacity as trustee of its respective Trust and in no other capacity. A
liability of any of them under or in connection with this agreement is
limited to the amount that is actually recoverable in the exercise of the
Trustee Sellers right of indemnity from the property of the relevant Trust,
except where the liability arises by reason of fraud by the Trustee Seller in
its capacity as trustee of the relevant Trust. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The limitations in this clause 8.23 apply despite any other
provision of this agreement and extend to all liabilities and obligations of
each Trustee Seller in any way connected with any representation,
warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this
agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | No Trustee Seller is obliged to do or refrain from doing

liability) unless the Trustee Sellers liability is limited in the same manner
as set out in this clause 8.23. 
---|---|---
