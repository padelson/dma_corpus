5    -iii-    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of August 28, 2001 (this "Agreement"), by and between
AirGate PCS, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Public"), and iPCS, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). It is contemplated that upon its
formation as contemplated herein, a newly formed Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Public, or another wholly owned subsidiary of
Public as the parties may agree ("Merger Sub"), shall enter into a joinder
agreement (the "Sub Joinder Agreement") pursuant to which it will become a
party to this Agreement.   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of
Public and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement,
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including all approvals necessary
under Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Public has agreed to recommend
that the holders of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Public (the
"Public Common Stock") approve the issuance of shares of Public Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger and the other matters contemplated to be submitted to
its stockholders in connection with this Agreement;   WHEREAS, Public and
the Company acknowledge and agree that as of the date hereof, Merger Sub has
not been formed and has not executed this Agreement. The Company acknowledges
that Public has agreed in this Agreement to form Merger Sub upon obtaining
the requisite Public Bank Consent (as hereinafter defined) and to cause
Merger Sub (or another wholly owned subsidiary of Public as the parties may
agree) to execute the Sub Joinder Agreement upon its formation;   WHEREAS,
as an inducement to and a condition to Public entering into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company are simultaneously herewith entering into
a Support Agreement, in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Company 
--------- Support Agreement"), relating to the agreement of such stockholders
to vote to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby;   WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and  
WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
2    ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this  ---------- Agreement, in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Merger Sub shall merge
with and into the Company. The Company shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be iPCS,
Inc. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall terminate.   1.2 Effective Time. No later than three
Business Days after the  -------------- satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "Secretary"), in such form as required by and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing,
or, if another date and time is specified in such filing, such specified date
and time, being the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and
after the Effective Time, the  --------------------- Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL.   1.4 Conversion of
Company Common Stock.  ----------------------------------   (a) At the
Effective Time, subject to Section 1.8 and Section 2.1(e) hereof, each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Common Stock held (x) in the Company\'s
treasury or (y) directly or indirectly by Public or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)) (including all shares
of Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company ("Series A-1 Preferred Stock") and Series A-2
Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company ("Series A-2 Preferred Stock" and together with the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, the "Company Preferred Stock") which shall have been
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
in accordance with Section 5(b)(ii) of the respective Certificates of
Designations (each, a "Certificate of Designations") with respect thereto)
shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into 0.1594 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Public Common Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock converted into Public
Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (each, a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
(i) certificates evidencing the number of whole shares of Public Common Stock
and (ii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) and Section 2.1(e). Certificates
previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of Public Common Stock and  
3   cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefore
upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.1
hereof, without any interest thereon. The parties understand and agree that
the Exchange Ratio has been calculated based upon the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2 and that, in the
event the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants or other stock equivalents
of the Company is greater than or less than the amounts specifically set
forth in Section 4.2 (including, without limitation, as a result of (i) any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2,
(ii) the issuance or expiration after the date of this Agreement of options,
warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock or (iii) any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into stock or any stock equivalent of
the Company, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change
occurring after the date of this Agreement), the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event
shall the aggregate number of shares of Public Common Stock issued (i) at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) and (ii) upon the exercise
of all options, warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock
assumed by Public pursuant to this Agreement, exceed 13,500,000.   (b) At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock and all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned directly or indirectly by Public or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no stock of Public or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefore. All shares of Public Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall become treasury stock of Public.  
1.5 Stock Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each option 
------------- granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a "Company Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a fully vested option
(a "Converted Company Option") to purchase shares of Public Common Stock in
an amount and at any exercise price determined as provided below (and
otherwise subject to the terms of the Company\'s Amended and Restated 2000
Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Company Option Plan"), the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder, and any other agreements between the
Company and an optionee regarding Company Options):   (i) the number of
shares of Public Common Stock to be subject to  the Converted Company Option
shall be equal to the product of the  number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Option  and the Exchange Ratio, provided that
any fractional share of Public  Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down  to the nearest whole share; and  
(ii) the exercise price per share of Public Common Stock under the  Converted
Company Option shall be equal to the exercise price per  share of Company
Common Stock under the Company Option divided by the  Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up  to the nearest whole
cent.   4    (b) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any
options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Code, and to the extent it is not so consistent,
such Section 424(a) shall override anything to the contrary contained herein.
The duration and other terms of the Converted Company Options shall be the
same as the original Company Options, except that all references to the
Company shall be deemed to be references to Public. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten Business Days),
Public shall use its reasonable best efforts to register under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof) shares of Public Common Stock issuable pursuant to all
Company Options converted pursuant to this Section 1.5.   1.6 Assumption of
Warrants. (a) At the Effective Time, Public  ---------------------- shall
assume and cause to be performed all obligations of the Company under:   (1)
the warrants (the "Warrants") issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated
as of July 12, 2000, between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholder
Services, L.L.C. ("ChaseMellon"), as Warrant Agent (the "Warrant Agreement")
to purchase 2,982,699 shares of Company Common Stock; and   (2) the warrant
(the "Sprint Warrant" and together with the Warrants, the "Company Warrants")
issued to Sprint Spectrum L.P. ("Sprint Spectrum") to purchase 1,151,938
shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) Each Company Warrant so assumed by
Public under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each outstanding
Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms), for that number of whole shares of Public Common Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares of Public Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the Public Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant
shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole cent.   (c) At the Effective Time, Public shall cause a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act covering Public
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants to become effective and
shall maintain the effectiveness thereof until the earlier of the expiration
of the Warrants or the date on which all of the Warrants have been exercised
by the holders thereof.   1.7 Public Common Stock; Merger Sub Common Stock.
(a) Except  -------------------------------------------- for any shares of
Public Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
shall be converted into treasury stock of Public as contemplated by Section
1.4 hereof, the shares of Public Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and
such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.   5    (b) At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
shall thereby become a wholly owned subsidiary of Public.   1.8 Shares of
Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything 
--------------------------------- in this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger or consent to the
Merger in writing and has properly exercised appraisal rights (the
"Dissenting Shares") under the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below) unless and until the
holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost, such holder\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to appraisal, then as of the occurrence of such event, each share
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held by such holder
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Public (i) prompt notice of
any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common
Stock or attempted withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and
(ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Public, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.   1.9 Certificate
of Incorporation and By-Laws. At the Effective 
---------------------------------------- Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   1.10 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger
Sub  ---------------------- immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.11 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the
Merger shall  ---------------- constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Section 368 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.   ARTICLE II  
EXCHANGE OF SHARES   6    2.1 Exchange of Shares, Distributions; Voting
Rights. Subject  ------------------------------------------------ to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall take,
or cause to be taken, the following actions:   (a) At the Effective Time,
each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration shall receive from Public in exchange
therefor, upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates and delivery to
Public of a property completed letter of transmittal (which letter of
transmittal shall be executed and delivered to Public prior to the Closing
and shall specify that, by surrendering such Certificates, subject only to
such holder\'s receipt of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(b), the holder shall be deemed to have waived all rights and claims and
to have released and discharged Public, Merger Sub, the Company and their
affiliates from any and all claims and liabilities whatsoever, whether known
or unknown, both at law and in equity, arising out of any matter, cause or
event occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the Effective Time, that
such holder would otherwise be entitled to assert against such Persons solely
by virtue of being or having been a stockholder of the Company ), (x)
certificates ("Public Certificates") representing the number of whole shares
of Public Common Stock which such record holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check representing
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Public Common Stock, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e)
(together with the Public Common Stock represented by the
Public Certificates, the "Merger Consideration"), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Public Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
Public, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.1, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b).   (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to Public Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of record of
any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. At the time of the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be issued or paid any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Public Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of Public Common Stock, all shares of Public Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be
entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Public
stockholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time the number of
whole shares of Public Common Stock represented by such Certificates,
regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.  
7    (c) If any certificate representing shares of Public Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
Public in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate representing shares of Public Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Public that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)
Immediately upon and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to Public, they shall be
cancelled and converted into the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b) in the manner provided in this Article
II.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Public Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Public Common Stock or Surviving
Corporation Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Public. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Public shall pay to each
former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive
a fractional share of Public Common Stock an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Public
Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") as reported by The Wall
Street Journal, New York City edition, for the five trading 
----------------------- days immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of Public Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.4 hereof.   (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, unless
otherwise agreed, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Public may direct and in a form reasonably satisfactory to Public,
as indemnity against any such claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, Public will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) in the manner provided in this Article II.   (g) Public
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Public is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Public, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in   8   respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Public. With respect to
any stockholder who is not a foreign person, Public shall receive
a certificate of nonforeign status in a form reasonably acceptable to it at
or prior to the time such stockholder surrenders its Certificates for
exchange in accordance with this Article II. The Company shall deliver to
Public on or prior to the Effective Time a certificate from the Company in a
form reasonably acceptable to Public that the Company is not a "United States
Real Property Holding Company" within the meaning of section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.   ARTICLE III   DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES   3.1 Disclosure Schedules.

AGREEMENTS   7.1 Regulatory Matters. (a) Public shall prepare and file
with  ------------------ the SEC, as promptly as practicable following the
date hereof (but in no event later than September 30, 2001) the S-4
Registration Statement (including the Prospectus/Proxy Statement constituting
a part thereof) in a form which contemplates the public reoffering of all of
the Public Common Stock issued to the former stockholders of the Company.
Public shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter shall mail the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Public shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the effective date of the S-4
Registration Statement all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses
incident thereto; provided, that Public shall not be required to 
-------- qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified to do business, to file a general consent to service of process in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to subject itself
to taxation in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified to do
business. In addition to the foregoing, as promptly as is reasonably
practicable following the date that the S-4 Registration statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, Public shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "S-3 Registration
Statement") relating to the proposed "Underwritten Offering" (as defined in
Section 2 of the Registration Rights Agreement). The Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any of the foregoing actions. Prior to filing the S-4
Registration Statement and the S-3 Registration Statement with the SEC
pursuant to this Section 7.1(a), Public shall provide the Company and its
representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the S-4
Registration Statement and the S-3 Registration Statement.   (b) The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other and use all reasonable efforts to
promptly prepare and file following the date of this Agreement all necessary
documentation (including, without limitation, assisting each party\'s
stockholders with filing notifications required to be filed by any such
stockholder under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger) to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, filing the notification provided for under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"))
in connection with the Merger, and taking all necessary action to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing in  -------- ------- this Section 7.1(b)
shall require Public or Merger Sub to agree to the imposition of conditions
or any requirement of divestiture as a result of antitrust concerns. The
Company and Public shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to the Company or Public, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any  
50   Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except for documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the
Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form filed under the HSR Act or
communications regarding the same or documents or information submitted in
response to any request for additional information or documents pursuant to
the HSR Act which reveal Public\'s or the Company\'s negotiating objectives
or strategies or purchase price expectations. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. In the event that either
party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse
effect upon the business of the Company, Public and any of their respective
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time which results from, or could reasonably
be expected to result from, the failure to obtain such consent.   (c) Each
of Public and the Company shall, upon request, furnish the other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the S-4 Registration Statement,

defined in Section 7.1(f)) or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Public, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Public or
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is
discovered by Public or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the S-4 Registration Statement, the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Public, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or would omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties to this Agreement and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed as soon as practicable
with the SEC or such Governmental Entity, as the case may be, and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Public.   (e)
Each of Public and the Company shall promptly furnish each other with true
and correct copies of written communications received by Public or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Associates from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any
Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, (i) in the case of Public, all written correspondence with the
SEC in connection with the S-4 Registration Statement, the S-3 Registration
Statement and the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and all other documents filed by
Public with the SEC prior to the   51   Effective Time and not available
via EDGAR, and (ii) in the case of the Company, all written communication
between the Company and the SEC prior to the Effective Time), except for
documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Pre-Merger Notification and
Report Form filed under the HSR Act or communications regarding the same or
documents or information submitted in response to any request for additional
information or documents pursuant to the HSR Act which reveal Public\'s or
the Company\'s negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase
price expectations.   (f) Public shall file a reoffering prospectus (which
shall include a description of the plan of distribution of the shares of
Public Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger, including, without
limitation, a description that contemplates all anticipated forms of sales
into the market, including underwritten offerings, as well as block trades,
and sales by in-kind distributees, which description shall be in the form
reasonably requested by the former stockholders of the Company) as part of
the S-4 Registration Statement or if not permitted by the SEC to be included
in the S-4 Registration Statement then promptly after the Effective Time but
in no event later than 15 days, Public shall file (i) pursuant to Rule 424
promulgated under the Securities Act or (ii) if not permitted under Rule 424,
then a post-effective amendment to the S-4 Registration Statement (together
with the prospectus included therein, in either case the "Public Shelf
Registration Statement") pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act in order to cover the resale from time to time of shares of
Public Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger, and any securities
issued or distributed in respect thereof, or in substitution therefor, in
connection with any stock split, dividend, spin-off or combination, or any
reclassification, merger, consolidation, exchange or other
similar reorganization or business combination (collectively, the "Merger
Common Shares"). If required to be filed as a post-effective amendment,
Public shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Public Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon thereafter as
practicable. Public will use all reasonable efforts to keep such Public Shelf
Registration Statement effective, including, without limitation, maintaining
current disclosure required under the Exchange Act, until the earliest to
occur of: (A) such date as all of the Merger Common Shares have been resold,
(B) such time as all Merger Common Shares held by the former stockholders of
the Company can be resold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act
and (C) the third anniversary of the Effective Time. Public shall provide
customary indemnification to all holders of Public Common Stock whose shares
are included in the Public Shelf Registration Statement.   7.2 Access to

Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of the Company\'s customers, jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment,   52   decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.   (b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Public shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,

information regarding Public and its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably
necessary for the Company to confirm that the representations and warranties
of Public contained herein are true and correct and that the covenants of
Public contained herein have been performed in all material respects. Neither
Public nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Public\'s customers, jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

its representatives pursuant hereto shall be treated as the sole property of
the delivering party and, if the Merger shall not occur, the receiving party
and its representatives shall, if requested by the delivering party, return
to the delivering party all of such written information and all documents,
notes, summaries or other materials containing, reflecting or referring to,
or derived from, such information. The receiving party shall, and shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to, keep confidential all
such information, and shall not directly or indirectly use such information
for any competitive or other commercial purpose. The obligation to keep such
information confidential shall continue for five years from the date the
proposed Merger is abandoned and shall not apply to any information which (x)
was already in the receiving party\'s possession prior to the disclosure
thereof by the delivering party; (y) was then generally known to the public
or (z) was disclosed to the receiving party by a third party not bound by an
obligation of confidentiality. It is further agreed that, if the receiving
party, in the opinion of its counsel, is required by applicable law,
regulation or legal process to disclose information concerning the delivering
party to any tribunal or governmental body or agency or else stand liable for
contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the receiving party may disclose
such information to such tribunal or governmental body or agency without
liability hereunder, provided, however, that prior to any  --------
------- such disclosure, the receiving party shall promptly notify the
delivering party so that the delivering party may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy.   (d) Each of Public and the Company agrees to
provide the other with copies of any and all material correspondence between

for one year following the Effective Time, employees and former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") shall either
continue to participate in the Company Benefit Plans on the same terms and
conditions as applied immediately prior to the Effective Time or shall
participate in plans, policies, programs   54   and arrangements ("Public
Plans") with substantially similar benefits in which similarly-situated
employees of Public and its Subsidiaries participate.   (b) With respect to
each Public Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section

vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and
vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), service with
the Company and its Affiliates shall be treated as service with Public;

------- recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. Company Employees shall
be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during
the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Public Plan.   (c) Following the Effective
Time, Public shall honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of
Public (including the Company) to honor in accordance with their terms all

thereof and which have been disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule and

believes has had or could reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the
date prior to the Closing Date), each party will supplement or amend its

for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in

agreements of such parties contained herein.   55    7.10 Current

Public;   (b) by either Public or the Company if the Merger shall not

Company (provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall
not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.3 hereof)
if any approval of the stockholders of either Public or the Company required

receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the
other party hereto, or sooner if such breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing;   (f) by either Public or the Company if any decree,

in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.   ARTICLE X
