(i) Each Company Share (including any Company Restricted Stock) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger Effective Time,
together with the associated rights issued pursuant to the Company Rights
Plan, shall be converted into and become one Share. Each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") or a book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") formerly
representing Company Shares shall thereafter represent an equivalent number of
Shares.

(ii) Each share of common stock of Holdco Sub, par value $0.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Company Surviving
Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 251(c) of the DGCL,
pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Holdco, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of the Shares:

 

(i) Each Share held by Parent, Holdco or any of their respective wholly owned
Subsidiaries (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of
third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be
cancelled and

 



-10-   retired and shall cease to exist (such Shares to be so cancelled and
retired, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), and no payment or distribution shall be
made or delivered with respect thereto.

(ii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, no par value per share, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(iii) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) automatically
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $14.50 plus, if Parent shall have exercised one or more Extension
Rights, each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions to be satisfied or waived at the Closing) shall have been satisfied
or waived, and the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the six
(6)-month anniversary of the date hereof, an additional $0.007621 for each day
during the period commencing on the six (6)-month anniversary of the date
hereof and ending on the Closing Date (such amount, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), in each case without interest, payable to the holder
thereof upon surrender of the Certificate or the Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.3. Such Shares
(including Shares into which Company Restricted Stock was converted) to be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall sometimes be referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number
of outstanding Company Shares is changed into a different number of shares or
a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, split-up,
combination or the like, other than pursuant to the Mergers, the amount of
Merger Consideration payable per Share and any other dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of the Shares the same economic

adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration or other dependent items, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this Section 2.2(c).

 

(d) Each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company
Merger Effective Time, granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or any applicable restricted stock award
agreements (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ "), shall, by
virtue of this Agreement, vest and become free of such
restrictions immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger Effective Time
and shall be treated as Company Shares outstanding and cancelled and converted
into an equivalent number of Shares in the Holding Company Merger, which
Shares shall be converted in the Acquisition Merger into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights available under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall

 



-11-   be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been
irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration, without
interest, upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.4. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
or Holdco relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and (b) the
opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Neither the Company nor

make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenting
Shares or offer to settle, settle or negotiate in respect of any such demands.

 

Section 2.3 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares and Company Equity Awards_. (a)
Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to serve as the disbursing
agent for the Merger Consideration and Holdco or such bank or trust company to
serve as the disbursing agent for payments in respect of the Holdco Equity
Awards (as the case may be, the " _Disbursing Agent_ "). Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the
Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares and Holdco Equity Awards
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if applicable, to pay
the Per Share Distribution in respect of all Merger Shares issued and
outstanding as of the Record Date (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending
distribution of the cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent, such cash shall
be held for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and Holdco Equity
Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall not be
used for any other purpose.

(b) The Disbursing Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Disbursing
Agent from their obligations to make the payments required by this Article
II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide, or cause to be
provided, additional funds to the Disbursing Agent for the benefit of the
holders of the Merger Shares and Holdco Equity Awards in the amount of such
losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any net
interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record
holder of Merger Shares as of immediately

 



-12-   prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions for
exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor
(and, if applicable, to receive the Per Share Distribution with respect to
such Merger Shares). The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and
will specify that delivery of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of
such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) to the Disbursing Agent together
with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and
any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in exchange therefor (and, if applicable, the Per Share Distribution),
without interest. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (and, if applicable, the Per Share
Distribution) in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and until
such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such
outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect thereof.

 

(d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any
applicable transfer and other similar Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or
establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such Taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

(e) At the Holding Company Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Holdco shall be closed and
there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Holdco of
the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (and, if applicable, the Per Share Distribution) in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

(f) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered
such holders Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) for the Merger
Consideration (and, if applicable, the Per Share Distribution) payable in
respect thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration (and, if applicable, the
Per Share Distribution). The foregoing notwithstanding, none of Parent, Merger
Sub, Holdco, Holdco Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Disbursing Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
an amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed
property Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares as of the date on which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of

 



-13-   any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Merger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Merger Shares, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and, if applicable, the Per Share Distribution) as
provided in this Agreement.

 

(h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by
such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent with
respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_. (a) Each of the Company, Holdco and
Holdco Sub has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this

Section 4.13 _Employee Matters_. (a) Each material Company Benefit Plan is
listed on Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and a true and
correct copy of each material Company Benefit Plan has been made available to

Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code has been operated
in good-faith compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, (i) the favorable tax treatment of any
material Company Benefit Plan maintained outside the U.S. (a " _Non-US Plan_
") is not the subject of examination or pending cancellation by the relevant
tax authority, (ii) there has been no act or omission on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in relation to any Non-US Plan

of a material penalty tax, fine, contribution notice or financial support
direction deriving from applicable law, (iii) each Non-US Plan has been
maintained in all material respects in compliance with any minimum funding
standards of applicable law, and (iv) no Company Employee has a contractual

respective Representatives) with whom the Company engaged in such discussions
to return to the Company or destroy any non-public information previously
furnished or made available to such third-party

 



-43-   Person or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its
Representatives to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such
information returned or destroyed in accordance with the terms of a
confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the Company and such
third-party Person.

(b) Anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(a) notwithstanding,
prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, the Company, or the Board
of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, may (i) furnish non-public information regarding the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures to, and afford access to the
business, properties, books or records of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or the Joint Ventures to, any Person and (ii) engage and participate in
discussions and negotiations with any Person, in each case in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to
taking any such particular action, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer;
_provided_ that (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
material breach of this Section 7.4 and such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn prior to the taking of such action, (B) the Company provides to
Parent the notice required by this Section 7.4(b) with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) the Company furnishes any non-public
information provided to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal only pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person with
confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent non-public
information that has not been made available to Parent is made available to
the maker of the Acquisition Proposal, provide or make available such non-
public information to Parent substantially concurrent with the time that it is
provided to such other Person. The Company shall promptly, and in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours after its receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, advise Parent of such Acquisition Proposal (including providing the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal and, (i)
if the Acquisition Proposal is oral, a reasonably detailed summary of the
material terms and conditions thereof or (ii) if the Acquisition Proposal is
in writing, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any related draft
agreements provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any change to the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and shall
provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent (i) if any such
change to the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
is oral, a detailed summary of such change or (ii) if any such change to the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal is in writing,
a copy of the so modified Acquisition Proposal and any related draft
agreements provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives.

(c) Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall prohibit the Company, or the Board of
Directors, directly or indirectly through any Representative, from (i)
informing any Person of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.4, or
(ii) disclosing, in the Company Proxy Statement or otherwise, factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures or the fact
that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making
such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that, in the case of this clause (ii), the Company shall in good
faith determine that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to
be disclosed under applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. So long
as the Company and its Representatives have

 



-44-   otherwise complied with this Section 7.4, none of the foregoing shall
prohibit the Company and its Representatives from contacting any Persons or
group of Persons that have made an Acquisition Proposal after the date of
this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the terms and conditions
thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Offer, and any such actions
shall not be a breach of this Section 7.4.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4(d) and Section 7.4(e),
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof may
(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, the Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent, or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any such action, a "
_Recommendation Withdrawal"_ ). Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board
of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Vote, make a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii), if: (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal
(that did not result from a material breach of Section 7.4(a)) is made after
the date of this Agreement to the Company by a third party, and such
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and (B) the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Offer and that a failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (ii) (A) the
Company provides Parent a four (4)-Business Day prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information
with respect to such Superior Offer that is specified in Section 7.4(b), (B)
after providing such notice and prior to making such Recommendation Withdrawal
in connection with a Superior Offer or taking any action pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(ii) with respect to a Superior Offer, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent during such four (4) -Business Day period (to the
extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms
of this Agreement as would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to
effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in connection with a Superior Offer or to
take such action pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) in response to a
Superior Offer, and (C) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by
Parent and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Offer if such changes offered in
writing by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_ that, in the event that
the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section 7.4(d),
except that the Companys advance written notice obligation shall be reduced
to two (2) Business Days (rather than the four (4) Business Days otherwise
contemplated by this Section 7.4(d)).

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder.

 



-45-  (f) Other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject
to Section 7.4(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 7.4(f)), nothing
in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the
Company from making a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Intervening
Event to the extent that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal would
be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall take any of the actions set
forth in this Section 7.4(f) unless the Company has first complied with the
provisions of Section 7.4(d), treating the occurrence of such Intervening
Event as if a Superior Offer had been received and after so complying, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal would be
inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law.

 

(g) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, the Company shall not terminate, materially amend or modify or waive
any provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving Parent). During such period,
the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and subject to the fiduciary duties of
the Companys Board of Directors, the provisions of any such agreements,
including obtaining injunctions to prevent any material breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take, or
be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited by this Section
7.4(g), if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside counsel of the Company, such action or
inaction, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) relating
to any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Reorganization,
the Management Business Sale, the Management Business Distribution and the
Distribution) pursuant to which any Person or group of Persons, other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (A) directly or
indirectly acquires (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through merger, asset sale, tender offer, exchange
offer, business combination, consolidation or otherwise) businesses or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that constitute twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the assets, revenues, cash flows, income or earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) directly or indirectly
acquires (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,
and whether through merger, tender offer, exchange offer, business
combination, consolidation or otherwise) beneficial ownership (within the
meaning of

 



-46-   Section 13 under the Exchange Act) twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
outstanding Shares;

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, change, fact, circumstance,
occurrence or development (other than an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal) that (i) is material to the Company, (ii) was not known
to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement or
if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known to
or understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, and (iii) becomes known or the material consequences of which
become known to or understood by to the Board of Directors of the Company
prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote (and is not an Acquisition
Proposal); _provided_ that an "Intervening Event" shall not include any event,
change or development relating to the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and

(iii) " _Superior Offer_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "25%" shall be replaced by "50%"), which the
Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, is more favorable
from a financial point of view to the shareholders of the Company than the
transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account all factors deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company, including timing and
likelihood of consummation and any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement.

 

Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Liability_. (a) The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume the
obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification
Contract between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), without further
action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the
Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than those set forth in the Companys and its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect as of
the date hereof or in any indemnification Contracts of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party as in effect as of the date hereof,
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect
of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent

 



-47-   shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 7.5.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each Person that is an
Indemnified Party or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, fiduciary or employee of
another Person, against any Damages incurred in connection with any Action
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including in connection with any actions or omissions taken at the
request of Parent, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company
Bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
are not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer or convey all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

(d) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance (or such other insurance that is no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance) in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a copy of
which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , _ however_ , the Company may, at its election,
obtain a "tail" policy with respect to such directors and officers liability
insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to
the directors and officers covered under such insurance policy as the limits,
terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in connection with this Section 7.5(d), neither the Company
nor Parent shall pay a one-time premium (in connection with a tail policy
described above) in excess of 600% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company for directors and officers liability insurance or be obligated to
pay annual premiums (in connection with any other directors and officers
insurance policy described above) in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for directors and officers liability insurance.
It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be
obtained for such amount or less, then the Company shall obtain the maximum
amount of coverage as may be obtained for such amount.

 



-48-  (e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this Section 7.5; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Person
provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.5 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 7.5, is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies. The provisions of this Section 7.5 shall
survive the consummation of the Mergers.

 

Section 7.6 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no takeover statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such takeover
statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of
the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such takeover statute on the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Recommendation
Withdrawal or any action taken by the Company or its Board of Directors
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public
announcement as may be required by Law, court process or any listing
agreement with the New York Stock Exchange, shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement without the consent of the other
parties (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent and the Company
agree to issue a mutually acceptable joint press release announcing this
Agreement.

Section 7.8 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and all of its Subsidiaries to honor, to
the extent required by their respective terms, each of the Company Benefit
Plans. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for each Company Employee employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (" _Current
Employee_ ") (i) an annual rate of base salary and annual cash target bonus
opportunity no less favorable, in each case, than the annual rate of base
salary and annual cash target bonus opportunity provided to such Current
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) compensation and
employee benefits

 



-49-   that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
employee benefits provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing in this Section 7.8
shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any time
in a manner consistent with any applicable contractual obligations, Company
Benefit Plans, or Law.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under any Company
Benefit Plans or under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or other
arrangement of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case which provides
benefits to any Current Employees as of and after the Effective Time (each, a
" _Parent Plan_ ") for such Current Employees service prior to the Effective
Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities, to
the same extent such service is recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than as would result in a
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension plan). With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any preexisting condition or
eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-at-work requirements with
respect to the Current Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give
effect, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for purposes of satisfying
any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current Employees and their
eligible dependents under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees and their eligible dependents
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, each Current Employee will
continue to be eligible for severance benefits in amounts, terms and
conditions no less generous than those which applied to such Current Employee
under the severance plans, programs, policies, agreements and other
arrangements of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and as are
set forth on Section 7.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of bonuses for the 2012
calendar year under the Companys existing annual cash bonus programs (the "
_Existing Programs_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each Company
Employee who is otherwise eligible to earn a cash bonus for calendar year 2012
under the Existing Programs and who either (i) remains employed through the
payment date of such bonuses, or (ii) is involuntarily terminated without
"cause" (as defined in the Companys form of Separation Pay Agreement as in
effect on the date hereof) after the Effective Time but prior to such payment
date, no less than such Company Employees target-level bonus in a cash lump
sum on a date consistent with past practice and in no event later than March
15, 2013. If the Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2012 and before
January 1, 2014, at the Effective Time, the Company shall pay each Company
Employee who is otherwise eligible to earn a cash bonus for calendar year 2013
under the Existing Programs a bonus no less than (x) such Company Employees
target-level bonus award under the applicable Existing Program, multiplied by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and
including January 1, 2013 through and including the Effective Date and
the denominator of which is 365.

 



-50-  (e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant, or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time; or (iii) to confer
upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including,
following the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries), or constitute
or create an employment agreement with any employee.

Section 7.9 _Company Reorganization; Management Business Sale;
the Distribution_. (a) The Company shall (i) subject to clause (ii), take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done
promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to effect the
Company Reorganization in all material respects, including each of the
transactions set forth on Exhibit 1, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be
done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to effect
any modifications to the Company Reorganization reasonably requested by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to clause (ii), the
Company shall not be required to take any action that would be reasonably
likely to adversely affect, or prevent or delay, the consummation of the
Mergers, the ability of the shareholders of the Company to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Companys ability to observe and perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Company Reorganization is being
undertaken to facilitate the Management Business Sale. If reasonably
requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Ventures to, effect
the Management Business Sale, including by entering into one or more
agreements prior to the Closing to effect the Management Business Sale;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not be required to take
any action that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect or prevent the
consummation of the Mergers, the ability of the shareholders of the Company to
receive an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration or the Companys
ability to observe and perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any
Management Business Sale shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing (or upon such time when all the conditions to the Closing are
satisfied or waived), and (iii) Parent shall indemnify and hold the
Company, its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures harmless from all costs,
expenses and liabilities incurred by any of them arising from or relating to
any such agreement (including any negotiation, documentation or execution of
such agreement) relating to the Management Business Sale.

(c) If requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Ventures to, effect a Management

 



-51-   Business Distribution, including by entering into one or more agreements and
making appropriate filings with the SEC prior to the Closing to effect a
Management Business Distribution;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Company shall not be required to take any action that would be reasonably
likely to adversely affect or prevent the consummation of the Mergers, the
ability of the shareholders of the Company to receive an amount of cash equal
to the Merger Consideration or the Companys ability to observe and perform
its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any Management Business
Distribution shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing (or upon
such time when all the conditions to the Closing are satisfied or waived), and
(iii) Parent shall indemnify and hold the Company, its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures harmless from all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by any of
them arising from or relating to any such agreement (including any
negotiation, documentation or execution of such agreement) relating to a
Management Business Distribution.

 

(d) To the extent that certain authorizations, approvals or consents of, or
notification with, third parties and Governmental Authorities may be required
in connection with the consummation of the Management Business Sale or
Management Business Distribution, the Company and its Subsidiaries agree to:
(i) cooperate with Parent in a commercially reasonable manner in developing
and implementing a strategy and process for seeking such authorizations,
approvals or consents, and making such notifications, including considering in
good faith any actions, (ii) consult with Parent on a regular basis and in
good faith in carrying out the foregoing strategy and process, and (iii) make
such notifications and use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain such
authorizations, approvals or consents, as promptly as practicable; _provided,
however_ , that, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not carry out any
particular action in respect of the Management Business Sale or a Management
Business Distribution without the prior written consent of the Company (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) If requested by Parent, the Company and Holdco shall declare a cash
dividend (the " _Distribution_ ") to holders of Company Shares as of
immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger Effective Time (if the
Distribution shall be declared and paid by the Company) or the Effective Time
(if the Distribution shall be declared and paid by Holdco) up to an aggregate
amount equal to the after-tax proceeds to the Company or Holdco from the
Management Business Sale, which Distribution may be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Management Business Sale; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Holdco shall not be required to declare the Distribution in any amount to the
extent Holdco is advised in writing by external counsel that such declaration
would constitute a violation of the DGCL (in which case Holdco shall declare
the Distribution in the maximum amount that the Holdco board determines shall
be permissible under the DGCL), and neither the Company nor Holdco shall be
required to take any action that would be reasonably likely to adversely
affect, or prevent or delay, the consummation of the Mergers, the ability of
the shareholders of the Company to receive an amount of cash equal to the
Merger Consideration or the Companys ability to observe and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. In the event of a Distribution, the parties
agree that (i) the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by the per share
cash amount of the Distribution (the " _Per Share Distribution_ "); provided
that, for purposes of the treatment of Company Equity Awards and the Holdco
Equity Awards pursuant to Section 2.4, the term "Merger Consideration" shall
mean Merger Consideration without adjustment for the Per Share Distribution,
if any.

 



-52-  (f) The Holding Company Merger will comply with Sections 251(b) and 251(g) of
the DGCL. 

(g) The parties expressly acknowledge that none of the consummation of the
Management Business Sale, the Management Business Distribution, the
Distribution, the receipt of any approvals or consents for the Management
Business Sale, the Management Business Distribution or the Distribution shall
be a condition to the parties obligations to consummate the Closing. 

Section 7.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause disposition
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
