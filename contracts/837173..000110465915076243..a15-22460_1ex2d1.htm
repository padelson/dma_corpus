Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall

2.5 _Assignment and Assumption of Contracts_.

 



 

(a)

 



 

(i) _Schedule 2.5(a)_ sets forth a list of all executory Contracts (including
all supply agreements, joint venture agreements, operating and joint operating
agreements, participation agreements, exploration agreements (including
minerals and coalbed gas exploration agreements), Leases and Lessor Leases)
relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets to which one or more of
Sellers are party (the " _Available Contracts_ ") which _Schedule 2.5(a)_ may
be updated from time to time to add or remove any Contracts inadvertently
included or excluded from such schedule. On or

 



      
 

 



 

before January 4, 2016 (such date, the " _Determination Date_ "), Buyer shall
designate in writing which Available Contracts from _Schedule 2.5(a)_
relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets that Buyer wishes to "Assume"
(the " _Assumed Contracts_ "). All Contracts of Sellers that are listed on
_Schedule 2.5(a)_ and which Buyer does not designate in writing for
assumption shall not be considered Assumed Contracts or Acquired Assets and
shall automatically be deemed " _Excluded Contracts_ " (and for the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer shall not be responsible for any related Cure Costs);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if an Available Contract is subject to a cure
dispute or other dispute as to the assumption or assignment of such Available
Contract that has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Buyer and
Sellers prior to the Determination Date, then the Determination Date shall be
extended (but only with respect to such Available Contract) to no later than
the earlier of (A) the date on which such dispute has been resolved to the
mutual satisfaction of Buyer and Sellers, (B) one hundred and twenty (120)
days following the Closing Date, (C) the date on which such Available Contract
is deemed rejected by operation of 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(4) and (D) the date
required by the Bankruptcy Court and set forth in either the Bidding
Procedures Order or the Sale Order (the " _Extended Contract Period_ "). If
such Available Contract is not expressly assumed by Buyer in writing by the
end of such Extended Contract Period, such Available Contract shall be
automatically deemed an Excluded Contract. Buyer shall be responsible for any
obligations or Liabilities arising during any Extended Contract Period
relating to any Available Contract that has not been assumed or rejected as of
the Determination Date as provided in this _Section 2.5(a)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in _Section 2.3_ and other than as
provided in the preceding sentence, (x) Buyer shall not assume or otherwise
have any Liability with respect to any Excluded Contract and (y) each
Collective Bargaining Agreement to which any Seller is bound or party to shall
be an Excluded Contract.

 



 

(ii) Each of Sellers and Buyer, as applicable, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assign, or cause to be assigned, the Assumed Contracts
to Buyer or to the applicable Buyer Designee, including taking all actions
required by the Bankruptcy Court to obtain an Order containing a finding that
the proposed assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts to Buyer
satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Buyer and/or each Buyer Designee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with all of the requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
necessary to permit such assumption and assignment.

 



 

(iii) If, prior to the Closing Date, there are Available Contracts that have
not been designated as an Assumed Contract or an Excluded Contract, Sellers
shall not assume or reject any such Available Contract pursuant to Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code and any order of the Bankruptcy Court, until the
earlier of (x) the date Buyer so directs Sellers and (y) the end of the
Extended Contract Period, if applicable (which assumption shall be at Buyers
sole cost and expense); _provided_ , that Buyer shall be responsible for any
obligations or Liabilities arising during any Extended Contract Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) At Closing, (x) Sellers shall, pursuant to the Sale Order and the
Assumption Agreement, assume and assign, or cause to be assigned, to Buyer or
to the applicable Buyer Designee (the consideration for which is included in
the Purchase Price) each of the Assumed Contracts that is capable of being
assumed and assigned and (y) Buyer shall pay promptly all Cure Costs (if any)
in connection with such assumption and assignment (as agreed to among Buyer
and Sellers or as determined by the Bankruptcy Court) and assume and perform
and discharge the Assumed Liabilities (if any) under the Assumed Contracts,
pursuant to the Sale Order and the Assumption Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Previously Omitted Contracts_.

 



 

(i) If prior to or following Closing, it is discovered that a Contract should
have been listed on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ but was not listed on _Schedule
2.5(a)_ and has not been rejected by Sellers (any such Contract, a "
_Previously Omitted Contract_ "), Sellers shall, promptly following the
discovery thereof (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days following
the discovery thereof), notify Buyer in writing of such Previously Omitted
Contract and all Cure Costs (if any) for such Previously Omitted Contract.
Buyer shall thereafter deliver written notice to Sellers, no later than five
(5) Business Days following notification of such Previously Omitted Contract
from Sellers, designating such Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" or
"Rejected" (a " _Previously Omitted Contract Designation_ "). A Previously
Omitted Contract designated in accordance with this _Section 2.5(b)(i)_ as
"Rejected," or with respect to which Buyer fails to timely deliver a
Previously Omitted Contract Designation, shall be an Excluded Contract.

 



 

(ii) If Buyer designates a Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" in
accordance with _Section 2.5(b)(i)_, Sellers shall serve a notice (the "
_Previously Omitted Contract Notice_ ") on the counterparties to such
Previously Omitted Contract notifying such counterparties of the Cure Costs
with respect to such Previously Omitted Contract and Sellers intention to
assume and assign such Previously Omitted Contract in accordance with this
_Section 2.5_. The Previously Omitted Contract Notice shall provide the
counterparties to such Previously Omitted Contract with ten (10) Business Days
to object, in writing to Sellers and Buyer, to the Cure Costs or the
assumption of its Contract. If the counterparties, Sellers and Buyer are
unable to reach a consensual resolution with respect to the objection, Sellers
shall seek an expedited hearing before the Bankruptcy Court to determine the
Cure Costs and approve the assumption. If no objection is served on Sellers
and Buyer, Sellers shall obtain an order of the Bankruptcy Court fixing the
Cure Costs and approving the assumption of the Previously Omitted Contract.
Buyer shall be responsible for all Cure Costs relating to such "Assumed"
Previously Omitted Contracts and for any obligations or Liabilities relating
to such "Assumed" Previously Omitted Contracts arising during the Extended
Contract Period.

 



 

(c) _Non-Assignment of Contracts and Permits_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Contract or any Permit, if,
notwithstanding the provisions of

 



      
 

 



 

Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, an attempt at assignment or
transfer thereof, without the consent or approval required or necessary for
such assignment or transfer, would constitute a violation of a Legal
Requirement or a breach of such Contract or Permit. If, notwithstanding the
provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the commercially
reasonable efforts of Sellers, such consent or approval is required but not
obtained with respect to an Assumed Contract or a Permit, neither Sellers nor
Buyer shall be in breach of this Agreement nor shall the Purchase Price be
adjusted nor (but subject to Buyers termination right set forth in _Section
11.1_) shall the Closing be delayed in respect of the Assumed Contracts or the
Permits; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Closing occurs, then, with respect to
any Assumed Contract or Permit for which consent or approval is required but
not obtained, from and after the Closing for a period of no more than six (6)
months, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate, at Buyers sole cost and expense,
with Buyer in any reasonable arrangement that Buyer may request to provide
Buyer with all of the benefits of, or under, the applicable Assumed Contract
or Transferred Permit, including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any
and all rights of Sellers against any party to the applicable Assumed Contract
or Transferred Permit arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by
such party; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent that any such arrangement
has been made to provide Buyer with the benefits of, or under, the applicable
Assumed Contract or Transferred Permit, from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for, and shall promptly pay and perform all payment and
other obligations under such Assumed Contract or Permit (all of which shall
constitute, and shall be deemed to be, Assumed Liabilities hereunder) to the
same extent as if such Assumed Contract or Permit had been assigned or
transferred at Closing with respect to Assumed Contracts and Permits, and at
such applicable later date specified in this _Section 2.5(c)_ with respect to
any additional Assumed Contracts. Any assignment to Buyer of any Assumed
Contract or Permit that shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 363
and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, require the consent or approval of any Person
for such assignment as aforesaid shall be made subject to such consent or
approval being obtained. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Buyer shall reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and/or
their Affiliates from any and all Liabilities incurred by Sellers and/or their
Affiliates in connection with any action taken by Sellers at Buyers or its
Affiliates request pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_.

 



 

2.6 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Bankruptcy Code and any orders of the
Bankruptcy Court, from and after the Execution Date, Sellers and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under
applicable Legal Requirements to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
with any Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii)
obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case, after giving effect to the Sale Order.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) At and after the Closing, Sellers shall execute and deliver to Buyer such
further instruments and certificates as reasonably requested by Buyer and
Buyer will reimburse Sellers for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Sellers in connection with actions taken by Sellers (i) to vest, perfect or
confirm ownership (of record or otherwise) in Buyer and/or one or more Buyer
Designees, Sellers right, title or interest in, to or under any or all of the
Acquired Assets and Business, including the Real Property, free and clear of
all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities)
or (ii) to otherwise effectuate the purposes and intent of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will
reimburse Sellers for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Sellers in
connection with actions taken by Sellers and each of the Parties shall take,
or cause to be taken, and cooperate with the other Parties to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, do or cause to be done all things as may be
reasonably requested by the other Parties in order to vest, perfect or confirm
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties
or assets in Buyer or one of more Buyer Designees or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, and shall execute and deliver all deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, powers of attorney, assignments, assumptions and
assurances, and as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, it being specifically understood that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no Seller shall have any obligation to (i)

(except to the extent Buyer agrees to reimburse Sellers for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with such recordation or payment),
or (ii) pay any title insurance fee or premium in connection with any title
insurance commitment or policy Buyer may obtain, in each case, included any
related costs and expenses (except to the extent Buyer agrees to reimburse
Sellers for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with
such commitment or policy).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3**

 



 

 ** _PURCHASE PRICE_**

 



 

3.1 _Consideration_.

 



 

The aggregate consideration (the " _Purchase Price_ ") for the purchase, sale,
assignment and conveyance of the Acquired Assets shall consist of:

 



 

(a) cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") in an amount equal to $5,400,000
(provided that such amount shall be reduced to $4,100,000 if Buyer makes a
Buyer TS Election);

 



 

(b) the assumption by Buyer or a Buyer Designee, as applicable, of the Assumed
Liabilities from Sellers, including the assumption of the obligation to pay to
the applicable counterparties of the applicable Assumed Contracts the Cure
Costs payable by Buyer under _Section 2.5_; and

 



 

(c) the release of Sellers that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit
Agreement and the Indenture of the First Lien Obligations arising under, or
otherwise relating to the Credit Agreement and the Indenture, and the First
Lien Adequate Protection Obligations, in an aggregate amount equal to **$**
1,250,000,000 (the " _Credit Bid and Release_ ") under Section 363(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code, as the same may be (w) decreased or increased in accordance
with _Section 7.8(a)_, (x) decreased in accordance with _Section 7.8(b)_,
(y) increased in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with _Section 7.8(d)_, and/or (z) increased by Buyer in its sole
discretion (including with respect to all or any portion of the Credit Bid and
Release) at any time during the auction contemplated by the Bidding Procedures
(or, if there is no such auction, prior to the Closing Date).

 



 

At the option of Buyer, Sellers shall retain a designated amount of
unrestricted cash that would otherwise be included in the Acquired Assets, and
such unrestricted cash so retained shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis,
the cash amounts that would otherwise be required to be included in the
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 3.1_.

 



 

3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) To the extent the acquisition of the Acquired Assets and/or the Business
is not treated as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, Buyer and
Sellers agree that, for Buyers and Sellers respective federal, state and
local income tax purposes, the Purchase Price, the Assumed Liabilities and
other relevant items shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets as mutually
agreed by Buyer and Sellers in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(b) Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the Closing Date Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement allocating the sum of the Purchase
Price, the Assumed Liabilities and other relevant items among the Acquired
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (such statement, the " _Allocation
Statement_ ").

 



 

(c) Sellers shall have a period of thirty (30) Business Days after the
delivery of the Allocation Statement (the " _Response Period_ ") to present in
writing to Buyer notice of any objections that Sellers may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless Sellers
timely object, such Allocation Statement shall be binding on the Parties
without further adjustment.

 



 

(d) If Sellers shall raise any objections within the Response Period, Buyer
and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute. If the Parties fail to agree
within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the
disputed items shall be resolved by a firm of independent nationally
recognized accountants reasonably chosen and mutually accepted by both Parties
(the " _Accounting Referee_ "), whose determination shall be final and binding
on the Parties. The Accounting Referee shall resolve the dispute within thirty
(30) days after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses
of the Accounting Referee shall be split in half and borne equally by Sellers
and Buyer.

 



 

(e) Unless otherwise required by law, the IRS or any other taxing authority,
the allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to the Allocation Statement (if
applicable, as modified by _Section 3.2(d)_ hereof) shall be final and
binding on the Parties, and the Parties shall follow the Allocation Statement
for purposes of filing IRS Form 8594 (and any supplements to such form) and
all other Tax Returns, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.
If the IRS or any other taxation authority proposes a different allocation,
Sellers or

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party of such
proposed allocation. Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide the
other party with such information and shall take such actions (including
executing documents and powers of attorney in connection with such
proceedings) as may be reasonably requested by such other party to carry out
the purposes of this _Section 3.2_. Except as otherwise required by any Legal
Requirement or pursuant to a "determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Code
(or any comparable provision of United States state, local, or non-United
States law), (i) the transactions contemplated by _Article 2_ of this
Agreement shall be reported for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
the terms of this _Section 3.2_, and (ii) neither Party (nor any of their
Affiliates) will take any position inconsistent with this _Section 3.2_ in
any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the allocation of the Purchase Price set forth in the
Allocation Statement (if applicable, as modified by _Section 3.2(d)_ hereof),
nothing in the foregoing shall be determinative of values ascribed to the
Acquired Assets or the allocation of the value of the Acquired Assets in any
plan or reorganization or liquidation that may be proposed.

 



 

3.3 _Limitation on Buyer Liability_.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, except for amounts deposited at Closing pursuant
to _Section 4.2_ (to the extent such amounts are required to be deposited
pursuant to this Agreement) or as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, Buyer shall have no liability with respect to the Estate Retained
Professional Fees Trust, Estate Retained Professional Fees Trust Amount (and
any other estate professional fees), the Payroll Trust Amount (and any trust
established pursuant thereto), the Wind Down Trust, the Wind Down Trust
Amount, the Walter Coke Trust or the Walter Coke Trust Amount.

 



 

3.4 _Withholding_.

 



 

Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Sellers such amounts as Buyer
is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Legal Requirements. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers.

limitations set forth in this _Section 4.4_, one or more Affiliates of Buyer
to (i) purchase specified Acquired Assets; (ii) assume specified Assumed
Liabilities; and/or (iii) employ Buyer Employees, in each case, as of the
Closing Date (any Person that shall be properly designated by Buyer in
accordance with this clause, a " _Buyer Designee_ "); it being understood and
agreed, however, that any such right of Buyer to designate a Buyer Designee is
conditioned upon (x) such Buyer Designee being able to perform the applicable
covenants under this Agreement and, as applicable, any other transaction
agreement to which Buyer is party and demonstrate satisfaction of the
requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (to the extent applicable),
including the provision of adequate assurance for future performance with
respect to the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities, (y) any such
designation not creating any Liability (including any Liability relating to
Taxes other than Taxes for which Buyer is liable pursuant to _Section
2.3(k)_) for Sellers or their Affiliates that would not have existed had Buyer
purchased the Acquired Assets, assumed the Assumed Liabilities and/or employed
the Buyer Employees, and which Liability is not fully reimbursed by or on
behalf of Buyer and (z) such designation not being reasonably expected to
cause a delay, or prevent or hinder the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Sale Hearing, Buyer
shall make any such designations of Buyer Designees by way of a written notice
to be delivered to Sellers, and Buyer Designees shall deliver a signed
counterpart to this Agreement or joinder agreement to this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which Buyer is party. No such designation shall
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder and any breach hereof by a
Buyer Designee shall be deemed a breach by Buyer. Buyer and Buyer Designees
shall be jointly and severally liable for any obligations of Buyer and such

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer Designees hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, all Buyer Designees appointed in accordance
with this _Section 4.4_ shall be included in the definition of "Buyer" for
all purposes under this Agreement and all such Buyer Designees shall be deemed
to have made all of the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS_**

 



 

Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer as of the
date hereof as follows, except as disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules or,
except with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 5.5_ and _5.9_ with respect to material environmental matters,
contained in the Incorporated Information:

 



 

5.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 



 

Each Seller is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Subject to the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, each Seller has all requisite
corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own or lease and
to operate and use its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Sellers are duly qualified or licensed to do business and are in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of their Business or
the nature of their properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.2 _Authority; Validity; Consents_.

 



 

Each Seller has, subject to entry of the Sale Order, the requisite corporate
or limited liability company power and authority necessary to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which such Seller is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and, subject to entry of the Sale Order, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and such other
Transaction Documents by such Seller and the consummation by such Seller of
the transactions contemplated herein and therein have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate or limited liability company action on
the part of Sellers. Subject to entry of the Sale Order, this Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by each Seller and each other
Transaction Document required to be executed and delivered by a Seller at the
Closing will be duly and validly executed and delivered by such Seller at the
Closing. Subject to entry of the Sale Order, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute, with respect to each Seller that is party
thereto, the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Seller, enforceable
against such Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors
rights generally or general principles of equity. Subject to entry of the Sale
Order, except (a) as required to comply with the HSR Act and the antitrust
legislation of any other relevant jurisdiction applicable to the purchase of
the Acquired Assets or the Business,

 



      
 

 



 

(b) for entry of the Sale Order, (c) for notices, filings and consents
required in connection with the Bankruptcy Case, including the requirements of
the Bidding Procedures Order, and (d) for the notices, filings and consents
set forth on _Schedule 5.2_, Sellers are not required to give any notice to,
make any registration, declaration or filing with or obtain any consent,
waiver or approval from, any Governmental Authority in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which a Seller is a Party or the consummation or performance of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for such notices,
registrations, declarations or filings, the failure of which to make or obtain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.3 _No Conflict_.

 



 

Except as a result of the Bankruptcy Case or as set forth in _Schedule 5.3_,
neither the execution and delivery by any Seller of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document to which it is (or will be) a party nor after
giving effect to the Sale Order, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby nor, after giving effect to the Sale Order and
the Bidding Procedures Order, compliance by it with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof will, (a) conflict with or result in a violation of (i) any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other
organizational or governing documents) of such Seller or (ii) any material
Order binding upon such Seller or by which the Business or any Acquired Assets
are subject or bound, (b) (i) violate, conflict with, or result in a material
breach of any of the terms of, or constitute a material default under, or give
rise to any right of termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration
under any material license or Permit held by Sellers, authorization, consent,
order or approval of, or registration, declaration or filings with, any
Governmental Authority or (ii) result in a material breach of or constitute a
default under or give rise to any right of termination, modification,
cancellation or acceleration under any Material Contract which is an Available
Contract, or (c) result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a
Permitted Encumbrance or Assumed Liability) upon the properties or assets of
such Seller being sold or transferred hereunder.

 



 

5.4 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) _Owned Real Property_. _Schedule 5.4(a)(i)_ sets forth an accurate and
complete list of the Owned Real Property. Except for Permitted Encumbrances,
Sellers have good and marketable title in the Owned Real Property set forth on
_Schedule 5.4(a)(i)_. Except for the Lessor Leases, none of the Owned Real
Property is subject to any lease or grant to any third-party of any right to
the use, purchase, occupancy or enjoyment of such Owned Real Property or any
material portion thereof required to conduct the Business. Except for
Permitted Encumbrances and the applicable terms of Permits held by Sellers and
their Affiliates, the Owned Real Property is not subject to any Encumbrances
(other than liens that will be removed pursuant to the Sale Order), which in
any material respect interfere with or impair the present and continued use
thereof in the Ordinary Course of Business. There are no pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings relating to any of the
Owned Real Property except those which do not materially impair or restrict
the current use of the Owned Real Property subject thereto. Other than as set
forth on _Schedule 5.4(a)(ii)_ hereto, there are no

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase any of the Owned
Real Property or any interest therein.

 



 

(b) _Lessor Leases_. _Schedule 5.4(b)_ lists, as of the Execution Date, all
material unexpired leases, subleases, licenses, sublicenses, occupancy or
other agreements whereby any Seller leases, subleases, licenses or grants an
interest in any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property to a third party
(the " _Lessor Leases_ "). Sellers have made available, to the extent that
they are in Sellers possession or control, true, complete and correct copies
of the Lessor Leases to Buyer, including any amendments thereto. Other than as
set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_ or as a result of the Bankruptcy Case, Sellers
are not in material breach of or in default under the Lessor Leases and, to
Sellers Knowledge, no party to any Lessor Lease has given Sellers written
notice of or, to Sellers Knowledge, made a claim with respect to any material
breach or material default by Sellers thereunder (other than as a result of
the Bankruptcy Case).

 



 

(c) _Leased Real Property_. _Schedule 5.4(c)_ contains a list of all Leased
Real Property held or used for, or necessary to the operation of the Business.
Sellers have made available, to the extent that they are in Sellers
possession or control, true and complete copies of all Leases to Buyer. Other
than as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(c)_ or other than as a result of the
Bankruptcy Case, Sellers are not in material (x) breach of any material term
or (y) "default" under any Lease and, to Sellers Knowledge, no party to any
Lease has given Sellers written notice of or made a claim with respect to any
material breach or material default thereunder. To Sellers Knowledge or other
than as a result of the Bankruptcy Case, there are no conditions that
currently exist or which with the passage of time will result in a material
default or material breach of any material term by any party to a Lease.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(c)_, to Sellers Knowledge, none of the
Leased Real Property is subject to any sublease or grant to any third-party of
any right to the use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Leased Real Property or
any portion thereof that would materially impair the use of the Leased Real
Property in the operation of the Business. Sellers have not received written
notice of any pending or threatened condemnation or other proceedings or
claims relating to Sellers interest in any of the Leased Real Property,
except those which do not materially impair or restrict the current use of the
Leased Real Properties subject thereto.

expected to be material to the Business or the Acquired Assets:

any Contract or Environmental Law, nor do Sellers have any unresolved claims
alleging any violations of Environmental Law;

 



 

(c) the Real Properties do not contain any Hazardous Substances in amounts or

expected to give rise to liability, including liability for response costs,
corrective action costs, personal injury, property damage or natural resources
damage, under any applicable Environmental Law;

 



 

(e) no Action is pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened under any

the Real Properties or the Business;

 



 

(f) Sellers (i) hold and are in compliance with all Permits required under

operations or for the current ownership, operation or use of the Real
Properties, including all Environmental Permits required for the coal mining-
related operations of Sellers or, to the extent currently required, any

(g) to Sellers Knowledge, none of the Real Properties have any associated
direct or indirect acid mine drainage which (i) constitutes or constituted a
violation of or (ii) could reasonably be expected to give rise to liability
under, any applicable Environmental Law or environmental provision of any
Mining and Mining Safety Law;

 



 

(h) to Sellers Knowledge, neither the Transaction Documents nor the
consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
will result in any additional material liabilities for site investigation or
cleanup pursuant to any Environmental Law or environmental provision of any
Mining and Mining Safety Law, including any so-called "transaction-triggered"
or "responsible property transfer" requirements;

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.5(i)_ and in _Section 2.3_, Sellers

Acquired Assets contains underground storage tanks, above ground storage
tanks, transformers or other equipment containing PCBs, underground injection
wells, non-naturally occurring radioactive materials or septic tanks or waste
disposal pits (to the extent such tanks or pits constitute Acquired Assets).

 



 

5.6 _Title to Acquired Assets_.

 



 

Sellers have good, valid and marketable title to, or, in the case of property
leased or licensed by Sellers, a valid leasehold or licensed interest in, all
of the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except (a) for the
Assumed Liabilities and (b) for Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

5.7 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Sellers have each timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be
filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities (taking into account any
extension of time to file granted to Sellers). All such Tax Returns are true
and correct in all material respects and were prepared in substantial
compliance with all applicable law, and, except as set forth on _Schedule
5.7(a)_, all material Taxes, including those relating to the Business and/or
the Acquired Assets, that are due and payable, whether or not shown to be
payable on such Tax Returns, have been timely paid, except for any unpaid
Taxes to be paid at Closing or expressly assumed by Buyer herein and paid

of any such Tax Return of Sellers is currently in progress by any Governmental
Authority and no Seller has received notice of any contemplated examination of

 **ARTICLE 6**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER_**

 



 

Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers as follows:

 



 

6.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 



 

Buyer is a limited liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer has the requisite
power and authority to own or lease and to operate and use its properties and
to carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

6.2 _Authority; Validity; Consents_.

 



 

Buyer has the requisite power and authority necessary to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Buyer and the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein and therein have
been duly and validly authorized by all requisite limited liability company or
corporate actions in respect thereof. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Buyer and each other Transaction Document to which
Buyer is a Party will be duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer, as
applicable, at the Closing. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which Buyer is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their respective terms,
except in each case as such enforceability is limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to creditors rights generally or general principles of
equity. Except as required to comply with the HSR Act or as set forth on
_Schedule 6.2_, Buyer is not or will be required to give any notice to, make
any registration, declaration or filing with or obtain any consent, waiver or
approval from any Person in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a Party or the
consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, except for such notices, registrations, declarations or filings and
consents, the failure of which to provide, make or obtain, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially affect Buyers ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

6.3 _No Conflict_.

 



 

Neither the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance by it with any of
the provisions hereof or thereof (a) conflict with or result in a violation of
(i) any provision of the organizational documents of Buyer or (ii) any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation in any material respect binding upon Buyer or (b) violate, conflict
with, or result in a breach of any of the terms of, or constitute a default
under, or give rise to any right of termination, modification, cancellation or
acceleration under (i) any note, bond, mortgage,

 



      
 

 



 

indenture, deed of trust, contract, commitment, arrangement, license,
agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party
or by which Buyer may be bound or to which any of Buyers assets may be
subject or affected in any material respect and that, in each case, is
material to the business of Buyer, or (ii) any material license, permit,
authorization, consent, order or approval of, or registration, declaration or
filings with, any Governmental Authority.

 



 

6.4 _Brokers or Finders_.

 



 

Neither Buyer nor any Person acting on behalf of Buyer has paid or become
obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder, investment
banker, agent or intermediary for or on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which any Seller is or will become liable,
and Buyer shall hold harmless and indemnify Sellers from any claims with
respect to any such fees or commissions.

 



 

6.5 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

There is no Proceeding or Order pending against, or to Buyers Knowledge,
threatened against or affecting, Buyer before any arbitrator or any
Governmental Authority which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent,
enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or which would or would
reasonably be expected to impair Buyers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

 



 

6.6 _Financing_.

 



 

Buyer shall, on the Execution Date and at the Closing, have the ability to
make the Credit Bid and Release and, at the Closing, shall have sufficient
available funds to permit Buyer to pay the Cash Consideration and all other
amounts to be paid or repaid by Buyer under the Transaction Documents to the
extent payable on or about the Closing Date, including amounts to be paid for
the Cure Costs and including all requisite financial assurances to be provided
by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.9_.

 



 

6.7 _Qualification_.

 



 

(a) To Buyers Knowledge, there exist no facts or circumstances that would
cause, or be reasonably expected to cause, Buyer and/or its Affiliates not to
qualify as "good faith" purchasers under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing, Buyer and/or each relevant Buyer Designee, as
applicable, will be capable of satisfying the conditions contained in Sections
365(b)(1)(C) and 365(f)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the
Assumed Contracts.

 



 

(c) As of the Closing, Buyer and/or each relevant Buyer Designee, as
applicable, will be capable of taking transfer of, or obtaining replacement or
overlapping permits for, the Closing Required Permits held by Sellers and, to
Buyers Knowledge, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, there exists
no reason why approval for any application for any Mining Permit or other
Governmental Authorization should be denied, other than any denial for
violations that may reasonably be expected to be cured by the time of such
transfer or obtaining

 



      
 

 



 

of Permits as contemplated by _Section 7.9_ and _Section 7.10_, and no
Buyer, relevant Buyer Designee, or any officer or director thereof, as
applicable, is or will be "permit blocked" on the Applicant Violator System by
any Governmental Authority.

Buyer is not relying on, any representations or warranties whatsoever,
statutory, expressed or implied, written or oral, at law or in equity, beyond
those expressly made by Sellers in _Article 5_ hereof (as modified by the
Disclosure Schedules). Buyer acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth
in _Article 5_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules), neither Sellers nor
any other Person has, directly or indirectly, made any representation or
warranty, statutory, expressed or implied, written or oral, at law or in
equity, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information that Sellers
furnished or made available to Buyer and its Representatives in respect of the
Business, and Sellers operations, assets, stock, Liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects. Buyer acknowledges that neither Sellers
nor any other Person, directly or indirectly, has made, and Buyer has not
relied on, any representation or warranty, whether written or oral, regarding
the pro-forma financial information, financial projections or other forward-
looking statements of Sellers, and Buyer will make no claim with respect
thereto. Buyer acknowledges that the Acquired Assets are being transferred on
an "AS IS, WHERE IS" basis.

 



 

6.9 _Information_.

 



 

Buyer has conducted such investigations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
it deems necessary and appropriate in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer
is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Buyer acknowledges that it and its Representatives have been
permitted full and complete access to the books and records, facilities,
equipment, Tax Returns, Contracts, insurance policies (or summaries thereof)
and other properties and assets of Sellers, that it and its Representatives
have desired or requested to see or review, and that it and its
Representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with the officers and
employees of Sellers to discuss the Business. Neither Sellers nor any other
Person (including any officer, director, member or partner of Sellers or any
of their Affiliates) shall have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, or
any other Person, resulting from Buyers use of any information, documents or
material made available to Buyer in any "data rooms," management
presentations, due diligence or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents.

 ** _ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE_**

 



 

7.1 _Access and Reports; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date through and including the Closing Date
or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
of

 



      
 

 



 

 _Article 11_, Sellers shall (i) afford Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to its personnel, properties,
books, Permits, Contracts and records, and furnish promptly to Buyer all
reasonable information concerning the Acquired Assets, the Business,
properties, any Benefit Plans and personnel as may be reasonably requested;
(ii) furnish to Buyer such financial and operating data and other information
relating to Sellers, the Business and the Acquired Assets as may be reasonably
requested; (iii) permit Buyer, to make such reasonable inspections and, at
Buyers sole cost and expense, copies thereof as Buyer may require; and (iv)
instruct the executive officers and senior business managers, counsel,
auditors and financing advisors of Sellers to reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and its Representatives regarding the same; _provided_ , that any such access
shall be conducted consistent with and not in violation of the Bidding
Procedures Order and in a manner not to unreasonably interfere with the
Business. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
shall be directed to Adam Schlesinger, PJT Partners LP, 280 Park Avenue, 16th
Floor, New York, NY 10017 or other person as designated by such person or
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Representatives shall
not (A) have access to personnel records of Sellers relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information
which in Sellers good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which
could subject a Seller to risk of liability and (B) have any right to perform
or conduct, or cause to be performed or conducted, any environmental sampling
or testing at, in, on or underneath any of Sellers properties without written
consent from the Company. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ or
by Buyer or its Representatives at any time prior to or following the date
hereof shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by Sellers herein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject in all respects to the Bidding
Procedures Order, this _Section 7.1_ shall not require Sellers to permit any
access to, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable, good
faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result in any violation of
any Legal Requirement or any Contract to which the Company or any Seller is a
party or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) or work
product protection that Sellers would be entitled to assert to be waived or
(ii) if the Company or any Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ , that, in the
case of clause (i), the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find
a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A) would
not (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with counsel,
which may be in-house counsel)) be reasonably likely to result in the
violation of any such Legal Requirement or Contract or be reasonably likely to
cause such privilege or work product protection to be undermined with respect
to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be
managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to
which non-employee Representatives of Buyer could be provided access to such
information.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, hold all confidential documents and information concerning
the Business furnished to Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents in accordance with the provisions of the

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality agreement attached to the Bidding Procedures Order which Buyer
shall execute in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order.

Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case to the
maximum extent practicable. Subject to restrictions under any Legal
Requirements, Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall

request for approval. Each Party shall also furnish the other Party with such
necessary information and assistance as such other Party and its Affiliates
may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registration or submissions of information to the Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and any such filing, notification or request for approval.

 



 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps reasonably necessary

decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries as may be required in order to

Sellers.

any matter that, if existing, occurring or known at the Execution Date, would

in no event will Sellers be permitted to supplement or amend any Disclosure
Schedules other than Disclosure Schedules required under _Article 5_ without

not be deemed to modify any Schedules other than the Disclosure Schedules
required under _Article 5_.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Developments_. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of, and
furnish Buyer any information it may reasonably request with respect to, any

7.8 _Certain Excluded Assets_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof until five (5) Business Days prior to the
Bid Deadline, upon prior written notice to Sellers, Buyer shall have the right
to amend _Schedule 2.2(a)_ to designate the Walter Coke Assets to be an
Excluded Asset (the " _Walter Coke Election_ "). Whether or not the Walter
Coke Election or the Pre-Closing Walter Coke Election is made, if there is a
Successful Bidder (other than the Buyer or a Buyer Designee) for the Walter
Coke Assets and such sale closes, the Credit Bid and Release shall be reduced
by $100,000,000. In the event that the Walter Coke Election is made and there
is no Successful Bidder for the Walter Coke Assets or the sale of the Walter
Coke Assets to a Successful Bidder or Backup Bidder (if any) for the Walter
Coke Assets does not close: (1) the Credit Bid and Release shall be

 



      
 

 



 

reduced by $100,000,000, and Buyer shall credit bid for the Walter Coke
Working Capital Assets in an amount equal to $22,000,000; (2) at the Closing,
or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the Walter Coke Working Capital
Assets shall be transferred by Buyer free and clear of all Liens and
Encumbrances to the Walter Coke Trust; (3) the Walter Coke Working Capital
Assets shall be liquidated by the trustee of the Walter Coke Trust and the
proceeds of the Walter Coke Working Capital Assets net of liquidation costs
shall be deposited in the Walter Coke Trust as provided in the applicable
trust agreement; and (4) the Credit Agreement Agent and the Indenture Trustee
shall be directed to release their respective Liens on the remaining Walter
Coke Assets. The funds in the Walter Coke Trust will be used by the trustee of
the Walter Coke Trust to fund the fees and expenses of the trustee of the
Walter Coke Trust, the fees of a Chapter 7 trustee if one is appointed for
Walter Coke, payment of professional fees for any professionals retained by
such Chapter 7 trustee, payment to employees for services rendered in
connection with the liquidation of the Walter Coke Assets, any accrued and
unpaid payroll and benefits incurred by Walter Coke prior to conversion to
Chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code, environmental remediation costs for the
Walter Coke Assets, and plant decommissioning costs for the Walter Coke
Assets, including any necessary technical professional services in connection
therewith. No dollar amounts set forth in this _Section 7.8(a)_ shall be
construed as a minimum amount required to be bid by a Qualified Bidder (as
defined in the Bidding Procedures) for all or any part of the Walter Coke
Assets; it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto, that, any
minimum bid requirements shall be as provided in the Bidding Procedures. If a
Walter Coke Election is made and there is no Successful Bidder for the Walter
Coke Assets or the sale of the Walter Coke Assets to a Successful Bidder or
Backup Bidder (if any) for the Walter Coke Assets does not close, at the
Closing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, Buyer shall provide, if
requested by the Trustee of the Walter Coke Trust, the Walter Coke Trust with
a short term (sixty (60) to ninety (90) day) loan of up to $5,500,000, which
loan shall bear interest at an annual rate not to exceed LIBOR plus 3.00%, and
which loan shall be secured by the Walter Coke Working Capital Assets and
shall be repaid by the trustee of the Walter Coke Trust from the proceeds of
such collateral ahead of any and all other expenses, debts or other
liabilities or obligations of the Walter Coke Trust (the " _WC Loan_ "). The
Walter Coke Trust may disburse the proceeds from such loan based on a budget
prepared by the Sellers estates or the trustee of the Walter Coke Trust,
subject to Buyers reasonable approval.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon prior written
notice to Sellers, Buyer shall have the right to amend _Schedule 2.2(a)_ to
designate one or more of the Miscellaneous Real Property Assets to be an
Excluded Asset.

 



 

(ii) If the Blue Creek Assets are sold to a Successful Bidder (other than
Buyer or a Buyer Designee) pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, (A) the Credit
Bid and Release shall be reduced by $50,000,000 and (B) notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but without limiting Buyers
rights and remedies under _Section 11.2_), Sellers shall promptly pay to
Buyer in cash an amount equal to (x) the fees and expenses incurred by the
Buyer, the Steering Committee, the Credit Agreement Agent and the Indenture
Trustee, including reasonable attorney fees, (that are not otherwise paid by
the Sellers under the Cash Collateral Orders) with regard

 



      
 

 



 

to the Blue Creek Assets in an aggregate amount up to $250,000, plus (y) a
break-up fee payable to Buyer equal to $1,500,000 (the amounts payable under
the preceding clauses (x) and (y) are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Blue Creek Bid Protections_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds immediately upon the closing of such sale of the Blue Creek Assets.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, effective
automatically upon (i) the Walter Coke Election (or the sale of the Walter
Coke Assets to a Successful Bidder other than the Buyer or a Buyer Designee),
(ii) the designation of any Miscellaneous Real Property Assets as "Excluded
Assets" or if any Miscellaneous Real Property Assets are sold to a Successful
Bidder (other than the Buyer or a Buyer Designee), or (iii) the sale of the
Blue Creek Assets to a Successful Bidder other than Buyer or a Buyer Designee,
in each case, pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, (1) any "Acquired Assets" to
the extent relating to the Walter Coke Assets, such Miscellaneous Real
Property Assets or Blue Creek Assets, as applicable, shall no longer
constitute "Acquired Assets" and shall instead constitute "Excluded Assets"
for all purposes hereunder (including for purposes of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article 5_ and the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Article 9_ and _Article 10_) to the extent relating to the Walter Coke
Assets, such Miscellaneous Real Property Assets or Blue Creek Assets, as
applicable, and (2) any "Assumed Liabilities" to the extent relating to the
Walter Coke Assets, Miscellaneous Real Property Assets or Blue Creek Assets,
as applicable, shall no longer constitute "Assumed Liabilities" and shall
instead constitute "Excluded Liabilities" for all purposes hereunder to the
extent relating to the Walter Coke Assets, Miscellaneous Real Property Assets
or Blue Creek Assets, as applicable (including for purposes of _Article 4_,
_Article 7_, _Article 9_ and _Article 10_), and shall be rendered
inapplicable and inoperative to the extent that such provisions relate to
"Excluded Assets" or "Excluded Liabilities" after giving effect to clauses (i)
and (ii) of this _Section 7.8(c)_, including the Walter Coke Assets, such
Miscellaneous Real Property Assets or Blue Creek Assets, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Acquired Assets set forth in _Section
2.1(m)_, _(n)_ or _(p)_ shall not constitute "Excluded Assets" as a result
of the Walter Coke Assets, such Miscellaneous Real Property Assets or Blue
Creek Assets being designated "Excluded Assets" and (y) the Walter Coke
Working Capital Assets shall not constitute "Excluded Assets" as a result of
the Walter Coke Assets being designated "Excluded Assets", other than on
account of the sale of the Walter Coke Assets to a Successful Bidder other
than the Buyer or a Buyer Designee.

 



 

(d) To the extent that there is no Successful Bidder for any of the Non-Core
Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek Assets) or the
sale of the Non-Core Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue
Creek Assets) to a Successful Bidder or Backup Bidder (if any) for such Non-
Core Assets does not close, (1) Buyer shall credit bid for the Acquired Non-
Core Assets and the Credit Bid and Release shall be increased by $49,000,000;
_provided_ , that such amount may be allocated among the Non-Core Assets
(excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek Assets) by Buyer or Buyer
Designee within forty five (45) days after the Execution Date but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Bid Deadline in Buyers sole
discretion, (2) at the Closing, such Acquired Non-Core Assets shall be
transferred to the Buyer free and clear of all Liens and Encumbrances other
than Permitted Encumbrances; and (3) the Credit Agreement Agent and the
Indenture Trustee shall be directed to release their respective Liens on such
Non-Core Assets (other than Liens on the Acquired Non-Core Assets, the Walter
Coke Assets and the Blue Creek Assets, the release of

 



      
 

 



 

which is provided for in _Section 8.10_). For the avoidance of doubt, if
there is no Successful Bidder (other than Buyer or a Buyer Designee) for the
Blue Creek Assets or the sale of the Blue Creek Assets to a Successful Bidder
or Backup Bidder (if any) for the Blue Creek Assets does not close, the Blue
Creek Assets shall constitute "Acquired Assets" for all purposes under this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Wind Down Trust will be used to fund the fees and expenses of the
trustee of the Wind Down Trust, the fees of a Chapter 7 trustee if one is
appointed for the entities owning the Non-Core Assets (excluding the Acquired
Non-Core Assets, the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek Assets), payment of
professional fees for any professionals retained by such Chapter 7 trustee,
payment to employees for services rendered in connection with the liquidation
of Non-Core Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek
Assets), any necessary technical professional services in connection with the
wind down of the Non-Core Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the
Blue Creek Assets) including, for the avoidance of doubt, technical
professional services relating to remediation and Reclamation of such assets,
and any accrued and unpaid payroll and benefits incurred in connection with
the Non-Core Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek
Assets) prior to conversion to Chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code. Any funds
remaining in the Wind Down Trust after payment of the expenses described in
this _Section 7.8(e)_ shall be transferred to Buyer.

 



 

(f) If (x) the Walter Coke Election is not made, (y) there is no Successful
Bidder (other than the Buyer or a Buyer Designee) for the Walter Coke Assets
or the sale of the Walter Coke Assets to a Successful Bidder or Backup Bidder
(if any) for the Walter Coke Assets does not close and (z) the condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 9.9(b)_ has not been satisfied, then on the
date that is two weeks prior to the projected Closing Date (which shall be
agreed upon in advance by the Parties), Buyer shall elect to either (1)
designate the Walter Coke Assets to be an Excluded Asset, (a " _Pre-Closing
Walter Coke Election_ ") or (2) waive the condition to Closing set forth in
_Section 9.9(b)_. If a Pre-Closing Walter Coke Election occurs, _Sections
7.8(a)_ and _(c)_ shall apply as if a Walter Coke Election had occurred.

and/or their Affiliates from any and all Liabilities incurred by Sellers
and/or their Affiliates as a result of any action taken by Sellers at Buyers
or its Affiliates request pursuant to this _Section 7.9(a)(iv)_.

 



 

(v) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (or such earlier time as may

and expense from and after the Closing) to cause any surety bonds (or other
financial assurances) in place as of the Closing with respect to applicable
Transferred Permits to remain in place and to maintain current levels of
surety bond coverage with respect to their Permits that are not Transferred
Permits until such time as the final approval for the transfer of such
applicable Transferred Permits to Buyer is

 



      
 

 



 

received. At all times from and after Closing and prior to the transfer to
Buyer of the Alabama Mining Permits and any other Permits not acquired by
Buyer before the Closing Date (including the Permits relating to the Gas Wells
in Alabama), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Buyers sole
cost and expense comply with all of the applicable Legal Requirements
governing, and all conditions and requirements of, or pertaining to, any such

not the obligation, to cure (including right of entry onto the applicable Real
Property), and Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers for the reasonable costs
of any such cure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer shall reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and/or their
Affiliates from any and all Liabilities incurred by Sellers and/or their

Affiliates request pursuant to this _Section 7.9(a)(vi)_.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, (x) until such
time as Buyer has posted replacement surety bonds or other required financial
assurances, pay or reimburse Sellers (within five (5) Business Days of receipt
of notice from Sellers Representative, which such notice shall contain the
applicable surety bond numbers and corresponding premium amounts, or other
appropriate references as to other forms of financial assurance) for the cost
of any premiums that become due after the Closing Date with respect to such
surety bonds or the cost of other financial assurances, (y) post any addition
to the principal amount of any such surety bond or other financial assurance
required by the Alabama Surface Mining Commission, the Alabama Oil and Gas
Board or any Governmental Authority after the Closing Date as a result of any
action taken by Buyer with respect to the Business and Acquired Assets in
Alabama and (z) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with any action taken by Sellers at
the request of Buyer.

 



 

(viii) Until such time as the Alabama Mining Permits are transferred to Buyer,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all reasonable and
necessary actions such that Buyer will not have been denied, or be made
subject to denial of, any application for any Permit or other Governmental
Authorization due to application of the Applicant Violator System established
pursuant to the SMCRA or any similar applicable state system.

 



 

(b) All fees, bonds or financial assurances required to be paid or provided in
connection with the actions to be taken under this _Section 7.9_ shall be
paid or provided by Buyer.

 



 

7.10 _Overlapping Permits_

 



 

(a) To the extent that the permitted areas and outfalls covered by any
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit which is an Excluded
Asset (each, an " _Excluded NPDES Permit_ ") overlaps with the permitted areas
and outfalls covered by one or more Transferred Permits issued pursuant to the
Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act (each, an " _Assumed SMCRA Permit_
"), Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate and use commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to remove, as soon as commercially practicable after the
Closing, the permitted areas and outfalls covered by such Assumed SMCRA
Permit(s) from such Excluded NPDES Permit. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as soon as commercially practicable after the Closing, (i)
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, file with the appropriate
Governmental Authority an application for a new National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit (each, a " _New NPDES Permit_ ") with respect to the
areas and outfalls covered by such Assumed SMCRA Permit(s) and (ii) the
applicable Seller shall, at Buyers sole cost and expense, take all actions
reasonably necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements to
modify such Excluded NPDES Permit to remove from such Excluded NPDES Permit
the outfalls and areas covered by such Assumed SMCRA Permit(s) (the "
_Overlapping NPDES Areas_ "). Sellers shall have (and Buyer grants) all rights
of entry onto the Overlapping NPDES Areas necessary for Sellers to maintain
the applicable Excluded NPDES Permit at all times following the Closing until
Buyers application for the applicable New NPDES Permit with respect to such
Overlapping NPDES Areas is approved by the applicable Governmental Authority
(the " _NPDES Interim Period_ ") and thereafter until final release of each
Excluded NPDES Permit.

 



 

(b) During the NPDES Interim Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) comply with all of the Legal Requirements governing, and
all conditions and requirements of, or pertaining to, any Excluded NPDES
Permit with respect to any Overlapping NPDES Areas and (ii) be solely
responsible for all incidents of violation, non-compliance, and similar
occurrences related to the Overlapping NPDES Areas covered by an Excluded
NPDES Permit that arise following the Closing. Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Sellers written notice of any such incidents, violations or occurrences, which

 **ARTICLE 8**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

8.1 _Taxes_.

 



 

Sellers and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets (including access to books
and records and Tax Returns and related working papers dated before Closing)
as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of
any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority, the prosecution or defense of any claims, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax, and the claiming by Buyer of any federal, state or local
business tax credits or incentives that Buyer may qualify for in any of the
jurisdictions in which any of the Acquired Assets are located; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to disclose
the contents of its income

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Returns to any Person other than the Parties. Any expenses incurred in
furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
shall be borne by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject in all
respects to the Bidding Procedures Order, this _Section 8.1_ shall not
require Sellers to permit any access to, or to disclose (i) any information
that, in the reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel,
which may be in-house counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result
in any violation of any Legal Requirement or any Contract to which the Company
or any Seller is a party or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) or work product protection that Sellers would be entitled to assert
to be waived or (ii) if the Company or any Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, any information that is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of clause (i), the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent
doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be reasonably
likely to result in the violation of any such Legal Requirement or Contract or
be reasonably likely to cause such privilege or work product protection to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with counsel, which may
be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room"
arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of Buyer could be
provided access to such information.

 



 

8.2 _Bulk Sales_.

 



 

The Sale Order shall provide either that (i) Sellers have complied with the
requirements of any Legal Requirement relating to bulk sales and transfer or
(ii) compliance with the Legal Requirements relating to bulk sales and
transfers is not necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

 



 

8.3 _Payments Received_.

 



 

Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each agree that, after
the Closing, each will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to the
other, from time to time as and when received by them, any cash, checks with
appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable efforts not to convert
such checks into cash) or other property that they may receive on or after the
Closing which belongs to the other and will account to the other for all such
receipts.

 



 

8.4 _Assumed Contracts: Adequate Assurance and Performance_.

 



 

Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide adequate assurance of the future performance by Buyer of
each Assumed Contract as required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Buyer and Sellers agree that they will promptly take all actions reasonably
required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been
an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future performance under
the Assumed Contracts pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, such as
furnishing timely requested and factually accurate affidavits, non-
confidential financial information and other documents or information for
filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making Buyers and Sellers
Representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court.

 



      
 

 



 

8.5 _Employee Matters_

 



 

(a) _Employees._ Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall set initial terms and
conditions of employment, including wages, benefits, job duties and
responsibilities and work assignment. Buyer shall determine which Employees,
if any, to offer employment to, in its sole discretion. Only Employees who are
offered and accept such offers of employment with Buyer based on the initial
terms and conditions set by Buyer and further then actually commence
employment with Buyer will become " _Buyer Employees_ " after the Closing.
Sellers shall terminate, or shall cause to be terminated, on or prior to the
Closing Date the employment of all Employees who are offered and accept offers
of employment with Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.5(a)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein will, after the Closing Date, impose on Buyer
any obligation to retain any Buyer Employee in its employment for any amount
of time or on any terms and conditions of employment. The employment of each
such Buyer Employee with Buyer (including any Buyer Employee who may be on
leave of absence) will commence immediately after the Closing Date. Except as
otherwise required by Legal Requirement, specified in this Agreement, or
otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer, Buyer shall not be obligated to provide
any severance, separation pay, or other payments or benefits, including any
key employee retention payments, to any Employee on account of any termination
of such Employees employment on or before the Closing Date, and such benefits
(if any) shall remain obligations of Sellers.

 



 

(b) _Access to Information_. Subject to _Section 7.11_, after the Execution
Date, Sellers shall provide Buyer, its Affiliates, and their Representatives
with reasonable access to the Employees and with information, including
employee records and Benefit Plan data, reasonably requested by Buyer and such
Affiliates, except as otherwise prohibited by Legal Requirements.

 



 

(c) _Benefit Plans_. Buyer shall assume all obligations under, and Liabilities
with respect to, any Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 8.5(c)_ (such
schedule to be provided to Sellers by Buyer not later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Bid Deadline) (such plans, the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ")
consistent with _Section 2.3(e)_ of this Agreement as Assumed Liabilities.
The Buyer Benefit Plans shall be assumed by and assigned to Buyer as of the
Closing Date (or such Buyer Affiliates as Buyer so directs) in the manner
described in this Agreement. To the extent that service is relevant for
purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not accrual under any employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Buyer or its Subsidiaries,
Buyer shall credit (or cause to be credited) the Buyer Employees for service
earned prior to the Closing with Sellers in addition to service earned with
Buyer on and after the Closing. To the extent the Buyer Employees and their
eligible dependents enroll in any welfare benefit plan of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries, subject to the terms of any such plan, Buyer shall undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause such waiver of, any
preexisting condition limitations applicable to such Buyer Employees to the
extent that Buyer Employees or eligible dependents condition would not have
operated as a preexisting condition under the applicable corresponding welfare
benefit plan as maintained by Sellers. In addition, subject to the terms the
applicable welfare benefit plan of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all waiting periods
under such welfare benefit plan otherwise applicable to the Buyer Employees
and their eligible dependents, other than waiting periods that are in effect
with respect to such individuals as of the Closing to the extent not satisfied
under Sellers applicable Benefit Plans, and (ii) provide each Buyer Employee
and his or her

 



      
 

 



 

dependents with corresponding credit under such welfare benefit plan for any
co-payments and deductibles paid by them under Sellers applicable
corresponding Benefit Plans during the portion of the respective plan year
prior to the Closing. At any time and from time to time after the Execution
Date, Sellers and Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions
necessary to effectuate the terms of this _Section 8.5(c)_, including taking
all action necessary to assign and assume and adopt each Buyer Benefit Plan in
the manner contemplated by this Agreement effective as of the Closing. Prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its
Affiliates and give commercially reasonable assistance as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to effectuate the foregoing. Nothing herein shall prohibit
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, from terminating, amending, or
otherwise affecting any Buyer Benefit Plan, at any time and from time to time
following the Closing.

 



 

(d) _Change in Control, Severance or Similar Benefits_. Prior to the Closing
Date, and to the extent necessary to implement this sentence, Sellers shall to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and, provided that the
terms of the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan or any other agreement with the
beneficiary under such Buyer Benefit Plan and any other applicable agreement
or arrangement with the affected participant or beneficiary permit such
amendments and other actions to be made unilaterally and without the consent
of any other party, amend all Buyer Benefit Plans and take or cause to be
taken all other actions as may be required or necessary to provide that (i)
the transactions contemplated hereunder shall not constitute a "change in
control" (or similar transaction) for purposes of providing or accelerating
benefits or payments under any such Buyer Benefit Plans, and (ii) severance or
separation payments and/or benefits (including payments of accrued vacation)
shall not be payable to any Buyer Employee on account of the termination of
such employees employment with Sellers, and that the termination by Sellers
of any Buyer Employee shall not constitute a "separation from service" under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h).

 



 

(e) _Payroll Taxes_. For purposes of payroll taxes with respect to the Buyer
Employees, Sellers shall treat the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as a transaction described in Treasury Regulation Sections
31.3121(a)(1)-1(b)(2) and 31.3306(b)(1)-(b)(2) (i.e., Buyer shall be treated
as a successor for payroll tax purposes); and as such, Sellers and Buyer shall
report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth under the "Standard
Procedure" provided in Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B.
320.

 



 

(f) _WARN Act_. With respect to Buyer Employees, Buyer will have full
responsibility under the WARN Act relating to (i) any act or omission of Buyer
after the Closing Date. With respect to the Employees, Sellers will have full
responsibility under the WARN Act relating to any act or omission of Sellers
prior to and on the Closing Date. Sellers shall be responsible for all other
WARN Act Liabilities relating to the periods prior to and on the Closing Date,
including any such Liabilities that result from Employees separation of
employment from Sellers and/or Employees not becoming Buyer Employees pursuant
to this _Section 8.5_. Unless otherwise agreed to by Sellers and Buyer,
Sellers agree to issue, no later than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing
Date, all WARN Act notices, in a form acceptable to Buyer, to the Employees
and all other parties required to receive notice under the WARN Acts.

 



 

(g) _Collective Bargaining Agreements; Employee Benefits_. Buyer does not
accept or assume any Collective Bargaining Agreements to which any Seller is a
party

 



      
 

 



 

to or subject to, and expressly declines to be bound by or accept the terms of
any such Collective Bargaining Agreements. Other than the Assumed Benefits,
Buyer shall not be obligated to, and does not, accept or adopt any wage rates,
employee benefits, employee policies, or any other terms and conditions of
employment.

 



 

(h) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Employment Status_. All provisions
contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or
compensation of Buyer Employees are included for the sole benefit of the
respective parties hereto. Nothing contained herein (i) shall confer upon any
former, current or future employee of Sellers or Buyer or any legal
representative or beneficiary thereof any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment, of any nature, for any specified
period; (ii) shall cause the employment status of any former, present or
future Employee to be other than terminable at will; or (iii) shall confer any
third party beneficiary rights upon any Buyer Employee or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof or any heirs or assigns thereof.

 



 

8.6 _Post-Closing Books and Records; Properties; and Personnel_.

 



 

From and after the Closing Date for a period of one (1) year, each Party shall
provide the other Parties (and their respective Representatives) with access,
at reasonable times and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with
their normal business, to the assets, books, records, systems and other
property and any employees of the other Parties so as to enable Buyer and
Sellers to prepare Tax, financial or court filings or reports, to respond to
court orders, subpoenas or inquiries, investigations, audits or other
proceedings of Governmental Authorities, to prosecute and defend legal Actions
or for other like purposes, including Claims, objections and resolutions, and
to enable Sellers to wind down the Business. During such one (1) year period,
each Party (and their respective Representatives) shall be permitted to make
copies of any books and records described in this _Section 8.6_, subject to
the confidentiality requirements set forth in _Section 7.1_. If any Party
desires to dispose of any such books and records, such Party shall, thirty
(30) days prior to such disposal, provide the other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to remove or copy such records to be disposed of at the removing
Partys expense. Buyer shall retain such books and records for a period of six
(6) years following the Closing.

 



 

8.7 _Casualty Loss_.

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if, before
the Closing, all or any portion of the Acquired Assets is condemned or taken
by eminent domain, or is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood or other
casualty, Sellers shall notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact, and (a)
in the case of condemnation or taking, Sellers shall assign or pay, as the
case may be, any condemnation or taking proceeds thereof (of which are payable
to Sellers) to Buyer at the Closing, and (b) in the case of fire, flood or
other casualty to the Acquired Assets, Sellers shall, at Buyers option,
either use insurance proceeds to restore such damage, or to the extent such
proceeds were not previously applied, assign the insurance proceeds therefrom
to Buyer at Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

8.8 _Change of Name_.

 



 

Promptly following the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its direct
and indirect Subsidiaries to, discontinue the use of its current name (and any
other trade names or "d/b/a" names currently utilized by each Seller or its
direct or indirect Subsidiaries) and shall not subsequently change its name to
or otherwise use or employ any name which includes the words "Walter" without
the prior written consent of Buyer, and each Seller shall cause the names of
Sellers in the caption of the Bankruptcy Case to be changed to the new names
of each Seller as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 8.8_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each Seller and each of its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries may use its current name (and any other trade name or "d/b/a"
names currently utilized by each Seller or its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries) included on any business cards, stationery and other similar
materials following the Closing for a period of up to one hundred and eighty
(180) days solely for purposes of winding down the affairs of each Seller,
provided that when utilizing such materials, other than in incidental
respects, each Seller and each of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to indicate its new name and reference its
current name (and any other trade names or "d/b/a" names currently utilized by
each Seller or its direct Subsidiaries) as "formally known as" or similar
designation. From and after the Closing, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement (including this _Section 8.8_), each Seller covenants and agrees
not to use or otherwise employ any of the trade names, corporate names,
"d/b/a" names or any mark that is confusingly similar to the Trademarks that
(i) are rights utilized in the conduct of the Business and (ii) are Acquired
Assets. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, as of the Execution Date, it is
not Buyers intention to use or otherwise use or employ any name which
includes the words "Walter" in its conduct and operation of the Business and
the Acquired Assets other than with respect to a transition period. Within
ninety (90) days following the Closing, Sellers shall file, and shall cause
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries to file, all necessary organizational
amendments with the applicable Secretary of State of each Sellers
jurisdiction of formation and in each State in which each such Seller is
qualified to do business and with the Bankruptcy Court to effectuate the
foregoing.

 



 

8.9 _No Successor Liability_.

 



 

The Parties intend that, except as included in the Assumed Liabilities, upon
the Closing, Buyer shall not be deemed to: (a) be the successor of or
successor employer (as described under COBRA and applicable regulations
thereunder) to Sellers, including with respect to any Collective Bargaining
Agreements and any Benefit Plans (except for Buyer Benefit Plans), under the
Coal Act, and any common law successor liability in relation to the UMWA 1974
Pension Plan, including with respect to withdrawal liability; (b) have, _de
facto_ , or otherwise, merged with or into Sellers; (c) be a mere continuation
or substantial continuation of Sellers or the enterprise(s) of Sellers; or (d)
be liable for any acts or omissions of Sellers in the conduct of the Business
or arising under or related to the Acquired Assets other than as set forth in
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Parties intend that Buyer shall
not be liable for any Encumbrances (other than Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Encumbrances) against any Seller or any of its predecessors or
Affiliates, and that Buyer have no successor or vicarious liability of any
kind or character whether known or unknown as of the Closing Date or whether
fixed or contingent, existing or hereafter arising, with respect to the
Business, the Acquired Assets or any

 



      
 

 



 

Liabilities of any Seller arising prior to the Closing Date. The Parties agree
that the provisions substantially in the form of this _Section 8.9_ shall be
reflected in the Sale Order.

 



 

8.10 _Liens_.

 



 

Buyer agrees to direct that the liens securing the First Lien Obligations and
the First Lien Adequate Protection Obligations and any debtor-in-possession
financing liens be released and terminated with respect solely to (a) the
Acquired Assets (or the Walter Coke Assets, the Blue Creek Assets or any other
Non-Core Assets upon the closing of the sale thereof to a Successful Bidder in
accordance with the Sale Motion and Bidding Procedures, provided that such
release and termination shall be solely with respect to such assets and such
liens shall continue to attach to the proceeds from such sale in accordance
with the Bankruptcy Code), (b) any Walter Coke Assets, upon the transfer of
the Walter Coke Working Capital Assets to the Walter Coke Trust, if the Walter
Coke Election or the Pre-Closing Walter Coke Election is made and there is no
Successful Bidder for the Walter Coke Assets as determined in accordance with
the Bidding Procedures or the sale of the Walter Coke Assets to a Successful
Bidder or Backup Bidder (if any) for the Walter Coke Assets does not close and
(c) any Non-Core Assets (excluding the Walter Coke Assets and the Blue Creek
Assets), upon the transfer of Non-Core Assets to Buyer or the sale of such
Non-Core Assets to a Successful Bidder or Backup Bidder (if any). For the
avoidance of doubt, following payment of the Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the First Lien
Lenders, the First Lien Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee or the Credit
Agreement Agent may assert any Lien on or superpriority administrative claim
against the Cash Consideration, notwithstanding anything in the Cash
Collateral Orders to the contrary, and Buyer and Sellers hereby direct that
the Cash Consideration, as a permitted use of Cash Collateral under and as
defined in the Cash Collateral Orders, shall be deposited at Closing into the
Wind Down Trust and utilized in accordance with _Section 7.8(e)_, including
by any Chapter 7 trustee.

 



 

8.11 _Other Agreements_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer in its sole discretion,
Sellers shall not cause or permit any Non-Core Assets to be sold, assigned,
transferred or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than Buyer, unless such
Person assumes (and is capable of assumption and performance of) all
Liabilities for Reclamation relating to any such Non-Core Assets to be sold.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall irrevocably waive any right
to use, utilize or otherwise access any funds or monies pursuant to any
provisions of the Cash Collateral Orders relating to the "Carve-Out." The
Sellers shall use best efforts to cause the Cash Collateral Orders to be
modified to reflect the terms of this section, including by eliminating the
Carve-Out.

 



 

8.12 _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any insurance policy included in the Acquired Assets
pursuant to _Section 2.1(y)_, that, immediately prior to the Closing, by its
terms provides coverage with respect to acts, omissions and events relating to
the Acquired Assets and Assumed

 



      
 

 



 

Liabilities, on the one hand, and Excluded Assets and/or Excluded Liabilities,
on the other hand, (such insurance policies, the " _Shared Insurance Policies_
"), Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Sellers and any
applicable Affiliate of any Seller with access to coverage under such Shared
Insurance Policies from and after the Closing for claims relating to acts,
omissions, and events respecting any Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities
(such claims, " _Excluded Insurance Claims_ "). Buyer and Sellers agree that
any Excluded Insurance Claims by Sellers and any applicable Affiliate of any
Seller under any Shared Insurance Policy shall receive the same priority and
be subject to any deductibles and retentions with all claims by Buyer under
such Shared Insurance Policies (whether or not such Excluded Insurance Claims
are made before or after any claims made by Buyer under the Shared Insurance
Policies). Claims made by Sellers and any applicable Affiliate of any Seller
and Buyer under the Shared Insurance Policies shall be treated on a _pari
passu_ basis.

 



 

(b) With respect to claims made under the Shared Insurance Policies, whether
or not known or reported prior to the Closing, each of Sellers and Buyer shall
report such claims directly to the applicable insurer (with a copy to the
other Parties) and the reporting Party shall individually, and not jointly,
assume and be responsible for the reimbursement liability (i.e., deductible or
retention) and/or any retrospective premium charges associated with the claim
so submitted by it, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the other Parties.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the provisions in this _Section 8.12_, no Party shall be
liable to any Person for claims, or portions of claims, not reimbursed by
insurers under any insurance policy for any reason, including coinsurance
provisions, deductibles, quota share deductibles, self-insured retentions,
bankruptcy or insolvency of any insurance carrier(s), policy limitations or
restrictions (including exhaustion of limits), any coverage disputes, any
failure to timely file a claim, or any defect in such claim or its processing.

writing, in their sole and absolute discretion:

 



 

10.1 _Accuracy of Representations_.

 



 

The representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in _Article 6_ shall be
true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any qualification
as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect) on and as of the Closing Date
with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Closing Date (provided that

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties which are confined to a specified date shall
speak only as of such date); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a
breach of a representation or warranty, the condition set forth in this
_Section 10.1_ shall be deemed satisfied unless the effect of all such
breaches of representations and warranties taken together results in a
material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall have received a certificate of
Buyer to such effect signed by a duly authorized officer of Buyer.

 



 

10.2 _Buyer s Performance_.

 



 

The covenants and agreements that Buyer is required to perform or to comply
with pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the Closing shall have been
performed and complied with in all material respects, and Sellers shall have
received a certificate of Buyer to such effect signed by a duly authorized
representative thereof.

 



 

10.3 _No Order_.

 



 

No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, decreed, or
entered any Order from and after the Execution Date, which is in effect and
has the effect of prohibiting (or delaying beyond the Outside Date) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

10.4 _Governmental Authorizations_.

 



 

(a) To the extent that the HSR Act is applicable, any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the antitrust legislation of any
other relevant jurisdiction applicable to the purchase of the Acquired Assets
or the Business contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or shall
have been terminated; and

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 2.5_, (i) all of the Closing Required Permits shall
have been transferred to, or obtained by, Buyer or (ii) with respect to any
Transferred Permits that have not been transferred at or prior to Closing,

operations immediately following the Closing on the Real Property.

 



 

10.5 _Buyer s Deliveries_.

 



 

Each of the deliveries required to be made to Sellers pursuant to _Section
4.2_ shall have been so delivered.

findings of fact and conclusions of law, acceptable to Sellers and Buyer, and

10.7 _Release_. Sellers shall have received a release on substantially the
same terms as the release provided by the Buyer as set forth in _Section
12.16(a)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ executed

(on behalf of itself) and the Indenture Trustee (on behalf of itself) as of
the Closing Date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

11.1 _Termination Events_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated at any time prior to the Closing only as follows (for the
avoidance of doubt, if the auction contemplated by the Bidding Procedures has
occurred and Buyer is not the Successful Bidder but has been declared the
Backup Bidder, Buyer agrees that it will not exercise its termination rights
hereunder pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , until the earliest
of (x) the Alternative Outside Date (as defined below), if applicable, (y) the
closing of the sale to either the Successful Bidder or Buyer) or (z) the
Outside Date, if applicable.

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by written notice from either Sellers or Buyer:

 



 

(i) if a Governmental Authority issues a final, non-appealable ruling or Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby where such ruling or Order was not
requested, encouraged or supported by any of Sellers or Buyer; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to any Party whose willful failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date;

 



 

(ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to February 29, 2016
(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing has not
occurred by such date, but on such date all of the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ and _Article 10_ have been satisfied or waived (to the extent
such conditions may be waived) other than the conditions set forth in
_Sections 9.4_ and _10.4_ , then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended until thirty (30) days after such initial Outside Date (and such
extended date shall be deemed to be the "Outside Date" for all purposes
hereunder); _provided_ , _further_ that the terminating Party under this
_Section 11.1(b)(ii)_ is not (at such time of termination) in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement so as
to cause any conditions to Closing not to be satisfied and shall not have been
the proximate cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the
Outside Date;

 



 

(iii) if at the end of the auction contemplated by the Bidding Procedures,
Buyer is not determined by Sellers to be the (A) Successful Bidder or (B)
Backup Bidder with respect to the Acquired Assets; _provided_ that in the
event Buyer is determined to be the Backup Bidder with respect to the Acquired
Assets, then, this Agreement will terminate automatically without further
action by any Party upon the

 



      
 

 



 

earlier to occur of (X) the closing of a Successful Bid and (Y) the date that
is sixty (60) days after the date of the sale hearing contemplated by the
Bidding Procedures (the " _Alternative Outside Date_ ");

 



 

(iv) if the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered an Order dismissing, or
converting into cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, any of the cases
commenced by Sellers under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and comprising
part of the Bankruptcy Case;

 



 

(v) upon the occurrence of any Termination Event (as defined in the Cash
Collateral Orders);

 



 

(vi) upon the date that is fourteen (14) days prior to the Bid Deadline,
unless Buyer and Sellers shall have reached agreement in their sole discretion
on each of the Deferred Matters, and this Agreement has been amended
accordingly to reflect such agreement; or

 



 

(vii) upon the final, non-appealable ruling or denial of the Governmental
Authorizations described in _Sections 9.4_ and _10.4_ and required to be
obtained by Closing.

 



 

(c) by written notice from Buyer:

 



 

(i) if any of the events set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of _Section
7.5_ shall not have occurred by the respective dates set forth therein;

 



 

(ii) other than as contemplated by the Sale Motion or Bidding Procedures
Order, if any Seller seeks to have the Bankruptcy Court enter an Order
dismissing, or converting into cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,
any of the cases commenced by Sellers under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
and comprising part of the Bankruptcy Case, or if a responsible officer or an
examiner with enlarged powers is appointed (other than a fee examiner)
relating to the operation of Sellers businesses pursuant to Section 1104 of
the Bankruptcy Code and the order of appointment is not vacated or reversed
within fourteen (14) days after the entry thereof;

 



 

(iii) in the event of any breach of, or failure to perform, by Sellers of any
of their agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
or in the Sale Order, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in a
condition set forth in _Article 9_ not to be satisfied and (B) cannot be
cured within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer notifies Sellers of such
breach in writing; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have a right of termination
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)(iii)_ if it is then in material breach of
any of its agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained
herein or in the Sale Order; or

 



 

(iv) if, Buyer (other than as a result of (1) Buyers own breach of this
Agreement or (2) the disallowance or avoidance of a substantial portion of the
First Lien Obligations and/or the Prepetition First Priority Liens (as defined
in the Cash Collateral Orders)) is unable, pursuant to Section 363(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code, to

 



      
 

 



 

credit bid in payment of all or any portion of the Purchase Price as set forth
in _Section 3.1_ (other than the Assumed Liabilities and the cash portion of
the Purchase Price); _provided_ , that the inability to credit bid post-
petition interest payable under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other amount not in excess of $1,000,000 shall not give rise to a termination
right under this _Section 11.1(c)(iv)_.

 



 

(d) by written notice from Sellers:

 



 

in the event of any breach of, or failure to perform, by Buyer of any of its
agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein or in
the Sale Order, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in a
condition set forth in _Article 10_ not to be satisfied and (B) cannot be
cured within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers notify Buyer of such breach
in writing; _provided_ that Sellers shall not have a right of termination
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ if Sellers are then in material breach of
any of their agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained
herein or in the Sale Order.

 



 

Each condition set forth in this _Section 11.1_ shall be considered separate
and distinct from each other such condition. If more than one of the
termination conditions set forth in this _Section 11.1_ are applicable, the
applicable party shall have the right to choose the termination condition
pursuant to which this Agreement is to be terminated.

 



 

11.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Buyer or Sellers pursuant
to this _Article 11_, this Agreement shall become null and void and have no
effect, and all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
shall terminate without any Liability of any Party to any other Party (other
than as expressly provided herein); _provided_ , that the provisions of
_Sections 7.1(c)_ (Access and Reports; Confidentiality), _7.6_ (Expense
Reimbursement), _12.9_ (Expenses), _12.10_ (Governing Law, Consent to
Jurisdiction and Venue; Jury Trial Waiver), and _12.16_ (No Liability) and
this _Section 11.2_ (and, to the extent applicable to the interpretation or
enforcement of such provisions, _Article _1), shall expressly survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject in all respects to the Bidding Procedures Order, Sellers shall pay
to Buyer the Expense Reimbursement by wire transfer of immediately available
funds immediately upon the first to occur of: (i) the earlier of (x) the
consummation by Sellers of an Alternative Transaction and (y) the date that is
60 days following Bankruptcy Court approval of an Alternative Transaction, in
each case, following termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(b)(iii)_; (ii) termination of this Agreement (other than a termination
pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)(i) or (iii)_) if, as of such termination, any
Seller (but not Buyer) was in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements under this Agreement so as to cause
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ not to be satisfied; or (iii)
if this Agreement is terminated (other than as set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) above or as a result of Buyers breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements under this Agreement so as to cause
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 10_ not to be satisfied), then
upon consummation by Sellers of an Alternative Transaction within nine (9)
months of such

 



      
 

 



 

termination (any such event, a " _Protection Event_ "); _provided_ that under
no circumstances shall Sellers be obligated to pay the Expense Reimbursement
more than once; and _provided_ , further that, if Sellers fail to pay any
amounts due to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 11.2(b)_ within the time
period specified herein, Sellers shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Buyer in connection with any
Action or Proceeding taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with
interest on such unpaid amounts at the Applicable Rate, calculated on a daily
basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of
actual payment. Notwithstanding anything herein, upon payment by Sellers of
the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section 11.2(b)_, Buyer shall be
precluded from any other remedy against Sellers, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and Buyer shall not seek to obtain any other recovery, judgment or
damages of any kind against Sellers in connection with this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any payment of the Blue Creek Bid
Protections pursuant to _Section 7.8(b)(ii)_ and the Expense Reimbursement
described in this _Section 11.2_ shall constitute liquidated damages (and not
a penalty) and shall be deemed to be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer
and any other Person against Sellers in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each Sellers respective former, current
or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all
former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees,
successors or assign of any of the foregoing, and each Affiliate, officer,
director, employee, controlling person, advisor, agent, attorney or
representatives of any such Person (each, a " _Related Party_ " and,
collectively, the " _Related Parties_ "), and no Related Party of any Seller
shall have any Liability or obligation (including any Liability or obligation
to pay the Blue Creek Bid Protections and the Expense Reimbursement) for any
or all damages suffered or incurred by Buyer or any other Person in connection
with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and, upon payment of the Blue Creek
Bid Protections and the Expense Reimbursement under such circumstances to
Buyer, neither Buyer nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other legal Action against Sellers or any Related Party of any
Seller and none of Sellers or any Related Party of any Seller shall have any
further Liability or obligation to Buyer arising out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for
such termination. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 11.2(c)_ are an integral part of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in light of the difficulty
of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing, the
right to any such payment of the Blue Creek Bid Protections and the Expense
Reimbursement constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will
compensate Buyer in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12**

 



 

 ** _GENERAL PROVISIONS_**

 



 

12.1 _Survival_.

 



 

All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to the
Closing shall, solely to the extent such covenants and agreements are to be
performed, or prohibit actions, subsequent to the Closing, survive the Closing
in accordance with their terms until fully performed or satisfied. All other
covenants and agreements contained herein, and all representations and
warranties contained herein or in any certificated deliveries hereunder shall
not survive the Closing and shall thereupon terminate, including any Actions
for damages in respect of any breach thereof.

 



 

12.2 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

Following the Closing, each Seller agrees not to, and to cause its
Subsidiaries not to, disclose any confidential or non-public information
concerning the Acquired Assets, the Business, the negotiation or existence and
terms of this Agreement or the business affairs of Buyer or the Assumed
Liabilities (" _Confidential Information_ ") except disclosure of Confidential
Information that (a) was or is lawfully obtained from a source that, to the
knowledge of such Seller, was not under an obligation of confidentiality to
Buyer with respect to such information, (b) is independently developed by such
Seller without violating any of its obligations under this Agreement, (c) is
or becomes available to the public, (d) is or may be necessary to wind down
any of Sellers estates, or in connection with the enforcement of the rights
of, or the defense of any Proceeding against or involving, any Seller provided
that the Confidential Information is afforded confidential treatment, (e)
primarily relates to any Excluded Assets and/or Excluded Liabilities, (f) is
or may be necessary in connection with the Bankruptcy Case provided that the
Confidential Information is afforded confidential treatment or (g) is
disclosed to a bidder in connection with an Alternative Transaction;
_provided_ , that the bidder in such Alternative Transaction agrees for the
benefit of Buyer to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller may disclose Confidential
Information if such Seller believes (upon the advice of counsel) it is legally
required to make such disclosure in order to comply with applicable law,
regulation, rule or legal, judicial or administrative process (including any
rule, regulation or policy statement of (i) any organized securities exchange,
market or automated quotation system on which the Companys securities are
listed or quoted, (ii) any self-regulatory organization of which a party is a
member) or (iii) in connection with the Bankruptcy Case. If a Seller or any of
its Representatives becomes required (including by deposition, interrogatory,
request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) or it becomes necessary in connection with the Bankruptcy Case to
disclose any of the Confidential Information, such Seller or Representative
shall use reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with prompt notice, to the
extent allowed by law, rule and regulation, of such requirement. Each Seller
agrees to disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it
believes it is necessary or required to disclose and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential
Information.

 



      
 

 



 

12.3 _Public Announcements_.

 



 

Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirement or by obligations of Buyer or Sellers or their respective
Affiliates pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such release or make any such
statement without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). From and after the Closing,
the Parties may make public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby so long as such announcements do not disclose
the specific terms or conditions of this Agreement except where such terms and
conditions have already been disclosed as required by Legal Requirement or by
obligations of Buyer or Sellers or their respective Affiliates pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange; _provided_ , that
the issuing party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof to the extent
practicable.

12.5 _Waiver_.

 



 

Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power,

be assigned by any Party by operation of law or otherwise without the express
written consent of all of the other Parties (which consent may be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of such other Party) and any assignment in
contravention of this _Section 12.7_ shall be null and void _ab initio_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to compliance with _Section 4.4_,
Buyer shall be permitted to assign all or part of its rights or obligations
hereunder to one or more Buyer Designees without the prior consent of Sellers;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Sellers shall be permitted to assign their
rights hereunder in part to one or more Successful Bidders or to the acquiror
of any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities without the prior consent of
Buyer; _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve Sellers from their
liabilities or obligations hereunder, other than with respect to such Excluded
Assets or Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

12.8 _Severability_.

 



 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability.

 



 

12.9 _Expenses_.

 



 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including _Section
11.2_, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the Parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including

actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

12.10 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue; Jury Trial Waiver_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
apply, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely in such state without regard to principles of conflicts or
choice of laws or any other law that would make the laws of any other
jurisdiction other than the State of New York applicable hereto.

 



 

(b) Without limitation of any Partys right to appeal any Order of the
Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction
to enforce the

 



      
 

 



 

terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes which may arise
or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or default
hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any and all claims
relating to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy
Court, and the Parties hereby consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Action or Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Bankruptcy Case has been closed pursuant
to Section 350(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, all Actions and Proceedings arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in a New
York state court or a federal court sitting in the state of New York, and the
Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
such courts in any such Action or Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Action or Proceeding.
The Parties consent to service of process by mail (in accordance with _Section
12.4_) or any other manner permitted by law.

 



 

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
SELLERS, BUYER OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NEGOTIATION OR
PERFORMANCE HEREOF.

 



 

12.11 _Counterparts_.

 



 

This Agreement and any amendment hereto may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original of this
Agreement or such amendment and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 12.4_, delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement or any amendment hereto by telecopier,
facsimile or email attachment that contains a portable document format (.pdf)
file of an executed signature shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement or such amendment, as applicable.

 



 

12.12 _Parties in Interest; Third Party Beneficiaries; No Amendment_.

 



 

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except with respect to the parties released and/or
exculpated pursuant to _Section 12.16_, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents are for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable benefit, claim,
cause of action, remedy or right of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to any
Benefit Plan.

 



 

12.13 _Remedies_.

 



 

Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise a right of set-off or to
give notice of a claim under this Agreement will constitute an election of
remedies or limit Sellers or

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be
available to any of them, whether at law or in equity.

 



 

12.14 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

Each Party recognizes that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in
accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached, and that monetary
damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the non-breaching Party or
Parties for their injuries. Accordingly, a non-breaching Party shall be
entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. If any Action or Proceeding is brought by the non-breaching Party
or Parties to enforce any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 12.14_, the Party in breach shall waive the defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each Party agrees to waive any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
Action or Proceeding seeking specific performance of such terms or provisions
and that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for specific performance of such terms or provisions is that it
contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of such provisions.
The rights set forth in this _Section 12.14_ shall be in addition to any
other rights which a Party may have at law or in equity pursuant to this

contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and in
connection with any activities to be performed by Sellers under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, for the purposes and with the powers, and
authority set forth in this Agreement, which will include the sole power and
authority:

 



 

(i) to receive and distribute the Purchase Price or any other amount paid in

(ii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of Sellers arising out of

(iii) to enforce or refrain from enforcing any right of any Seller (prior to

(iv) to take any action to be taken by one or more Sellers under or in

Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Any
document delivered or notice delivered by or on behalf of Buyer or its
Affiliates to, or action taken by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates with

instrument entered into in connection herewith of

 



      
 

 



 

or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or any agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto or thereto, and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein or therein. Other than the Parties,
no other party shall have any Liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities
of any party under this Agreement or the agreements, documents or instruments
contemplated hereby or of or for any Legal Proceeding based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including
the breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each
case whether based on contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other Legal
Requirements or otherwise and whether by piercing the corporate veil, by a
claim by or on behalf of a Party or another Person or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Effective upon the Closing Date, each Seller acknowledges that it has no
claim, counterclaim, setoff, recoupment, action or cause of action of any kind
or nature whatsoever against any of the individuals or entities within the
Buyer Group, any member of the Steering Committee, any of the First Lien
Lenders or the First Lien Noteholders, the Credit Agreement Agent, or the
Indenture Trustee, that directly or indirectly arises out of, is based upon,
or is in any manner connected with any Prior Event (collectively, the "
_Seller Released Claims_ "); and, should any Seller Released Claims
nonetheless exist, each Seller hereby (i) releases and discharges each member
of the Buyer Group, any member of the Steering Committee, each of the First
Lien Lenders and the First Lien Noteholders, the Credit Agreement Agent and
the Indenture Trustee from any liability whatsoever on such Seller Released
Claims that directly or indirectly arises out of, is based upon, or is in any
manner connected with a Prior Event, and (ii) releases, remises, waives and
discharges all such Seller Released Claims against the Buyer Group, any member
of the Steering Committee, each of the First Lien Lenders and the First Lien
Noteholders, the Credit Agreement Agent and the Indenture Trustee; _provided_
that nothing herein shall release the Buyer or a Seller of its obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Effective upon the Closing Date, Buyer acknowledges that it has no claim,
counterclaim, setoff, recoupment, action or cause of action of any kind or
nature whatsoever against any of the individuals or entities within the
Sellers Group, that directly or indirectly arises out of, is based upon, or is
in any manner connected with any Prior Event (collectively, the " _Buyer
Released Claims_ "); and, should any Buyer Released Claims nonetheless exist,
Buyer hereby (i) releases and discharges each member of the Sellers Group from
any liability whatsoever on such Buyer Released Claims that directly or
indirectly arises out of, is based upon, or is in any manner connected with a
Prior Event, and (ii) releases, remises, waives and discharges all such Buyer
Released Claims against the Sellers Group.

 



 

(d) Without limiting in any way the scope of the release contained in
subparagraph (a),(b) or (c) of this _Section 12.16_ and effective upon the
Closing Date, each Seller and Buyer, to the fullest extent allowed under
applicable law, hereby waives and relinquishes all statutory and common law
protections purporting to limit the scope or effect of a general release,
whether due to lack of knowledge of any claim or otherwise, including, waiving
and relinquishing the terms of any law which provides that a release may not
apply to material unknown Claims. Each Seller and Buyer hereby affirms its
intent to waive and relinquish such unknown Claims and to waive and relinquish
any statutory or common law protection available

 



      
 

 



 

in any applicable jurisdiction with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything
set forth herein to the contrary, the releases set forth in this _Section
12.16_ do not extend to (A) any obligations that are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted
from the willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence of such Person, (B) any
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement or (C) any claims held by the
First Lien Lenders, the First Lien Noteholders, the Credit Agreement Agent or
the Indenture Trustee against the Sellers Group (including the rights of the
Credit Agreement Agent under Section 12.06 and 13.01 of the Credit Agreement
and the rights of the Indenture Trustee under Sections 7.06 and 10.02 of the
Indenture, but excluding the First Lien Obligations and the First Lien
Adequate Protection Obligations which are included in the Credit Bid and
Release) and any rights, remedies or causes of action arising out of such
claims or Liens and security interests relating to such claims; _provided_
that any claims, including First Lien Obligations and First Lien Adequate
Protection Obligations, or any Liens or superpriority claims related thereto
that would otherwise attach or be payable out of the Cash Consideration, shall
be waived, and the Buyer and Sellers hereby direct that the Cash
Consideration, as a permitted use of Cash Collateral under and as defined in
the Cash Collateral Orders, be deposited into the Wind Down Trust at Closing
and utilized in accordance with _Section 7.8(e)_, including by any Chapter 7
trustee.
