described in this Article 2. Any

 



      
 

 



 

adjustments to the Purchase Price other than the adjustments provided for in
Section 2.6 shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the amounts set forth on
**_Schedule 2.4(a)_ **for all Assets. After all such adjustments are made,
any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6 shall be applied
to the amounts set forth in **_Schedule 2.4(a)_** , for the particular
affected Assets. Seller makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy
of the Allocated Values assigned to each of the Assets.

 



 

(b) Seller, using the Allocated Values determined under Section 2.4(a) to the
extent applicable, shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price on a
schedule (the **_"Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule"_**) for purposes
of, and in accordance with, Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder within 30 days after the Final Settlement Date. Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any objections to the Proposed Section 1060
Allocation Schedule within 15 days of receipt thereof and if, within 30 days
after delivery of notice of such objection, Buyer and Seller cannot agree to a
final allocation schedule to be used for income Tax reporting purposes, Buyer
and Seller shall submit the disputed matters to binding arbitration pursuant
to Section 15.13 to finally determine the proper allocation of the Purchase
Price for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code, and shall request that the
arbitrator issue a final allocation schedule (the **_"Final Section 1060
Allocation Schedule"_**) within 30 days of the submission of the dispute.
Seller and Buyer agree that the allocation of the Purchase Price as set forth
on the Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule shall be used by Seller and
Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of
all federal, state and local Tax Returns, including without limitation
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594. Seller and Buyer further agree that each
will take no position inconsistent with such allocations on any applicable Tax
Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Governmental Entity related to
Taxes, in any report made for Tax, financial accounting or any other purpose,
or otherwise. In the event that the allocation described herein is disputed by
any Governmental Entity, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other Party concerning resolution of the dispute.

 



 

2.5. _Additional Escrow Amount_. The Additional Escrow Amount, from time to
time, together with the interest earned thereon, shall be deposited and held
in the Escrow Fund and released in accordance with Articles 4 and 5,
respectively.

 



 

2.6. _Adjustments to Purchase Price and Preliminary Settlement Statement_. The
Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to this Section 2.6 without
duplication. At least five Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Buyer a statement showing its good faith computations of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for and required under this
Agreement, and including reasonable supporting detail ( ** _"Preliminary
Settlement Statement"_** ). The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall set
forth the Purchase Price as adjusted as provided in this Section 2.6 using the
best information available to Seller as of the date the Preliminary Settlement
Statement is delivered to Buyer (the **_"Preliminary Purchase Price"_** ). In
the event Buyer objects in writing to Sellers calculation of the Preliminary
Purchase Price, not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections in a mutually acceptable manner prior to the Closing Date;
provided, to the extent such objections are not so resolved by mutual
agreement of Seller and Buyer prior to the Closing Date, the Closing shall
proceed using the Closing Date Title Adjustment Amount but otherwise using
Sellers calculation of the other components of the Preliminary Purchase
Price, as adjusted to reflect any agreed resolution of any disputed item (as

 



      
 

 



 

so adjusted, the **_"Adjusted Preliminary Purchase Price"_** ) and subject to
post-Closing true-up as any remaining disputed items are resolved in
accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(a) _Upward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the
following:

 



 

(1) The proceeds received by Buyer, net of royalties, overriding royalties,
profit payments and similar burdens, from the sale of any Hydrocarbons that
were produced from the Assets prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(2) An amount equal to all Property Expenses attributable to the Assets from
and after the Effective Time that were paid by Seller (all to be apportioned
as of the Effective Time);

 



 

(3) The amount required to be paid by Buyer to Seller under Section 4.2(i), if
any;

 



 

(4) Transfer Taxes paid by Seller with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(5) An amount equal to sum of the unbilled costs for the joint interest
billings paid by Seller and, the accounts receivable, for the joint interest
billings paid by Seller on behalf of third party working interest owners, each
as of the Closing Date, in the Leases, Wells or Units; and

 



 

(6) Any other amount agreed to by Buyer and Seller.

 



 

(b) _Downward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by
the following:

 



 

(1) The amount required to be paid by Seller to Buyer under Section 4.2(i), if
any;

 



 

(2) An amount equal to the Environmental Adjustment Amount, if any, pursuant
to Section 5.4;

 



 

(3) The Allocated Value of those Assets not conveyed at Closing due to Seller
withholding its consent to an Inspection Request in accordance with Section
3.3(a);

 



 

(4) The Allocated Value of those Assets not conveyed at Closing due to the
failure to obtain a consent to assign in accordance with Section 4.4(a) or the
exercise of any preferential rights to purchase in accordance with Section
4.4(b);

 



 

(5) Any proceeds of Hydrocarbons produced from and after the Effective Time,
net of royalties, overriding royalties, net profit payments and similar
burdens and Production Taxes, received by Seller between the Effective Time
and Closing relating to the Assets;

 



       
 

 



 

(6) An amount equal to the revenue held in suspense by Seller, as of the
Closing Date, for royalties, overriding royalties and similar leasehold
burdens and handled in accordance with Section 8.1(e);

 



 

(7) An amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Assets affected by any
Casualty Loss, or an amount equal to any Net Casualty Loss, pursuant to
Section 8.3(b); and

 



 

(8) Any other amount agreed to by Buyer and Seller.

 



 

(c) _Pipeline and Well Imbalance Adjustments_. The Parties agree that in
calculating the Closing Amount, the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward
or upward, as appropriate, for pipeline and well imbalances related to the
Assets, if any, as follows: The sum of all gas underproduction imbalances less
the sum of all overproduction imbalances is herein called the **_"Net
Imbalance"_** and the **_"Net Imbalance Amount"_** (which may be a positive or
negative dollar amount) means the Net Imbalance multiplied by $3.55 per Mcf.

 



 

2.7. _Proration of Costs and Revenues_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price provided for in Section 2.6, the principles set forth in this Section
2.7(a) shall apply. Buyer shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons
from or attributable to the Leases, Lands, and Wells at and after the
Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to
all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Assets at or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and
entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred at and
after the Effective Time. Seller shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon
production from or attributable to Leases, Lands, and Wells prior to the
Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to
all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled
to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time. **_"Earned"_** and **_"incurred"_** , as used in the Agreement
shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society standards, and
expenditures that are incurred pursuant to an operating agreement, unit
agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred when expended by the
operator of the applicable Lease, Land or Well, in accordance with Sellers
then current practice. For purposes of allocating production (and accounts
receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.7(a), (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be **_"from or attributable to"_** the Leases,
Lands, and Wells when they pass through the inlet flange of the pipeline
connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or, if there
are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or
similar meters at the initial point of entry into the pipelines through which
they are transport ** _ed from the field, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall
be deemed to be_** "from or attributable to" the Leases, Lands, and Wells when
they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters
or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which
they are transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). Seller shall
utilize reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry
practice, to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
or gauging and strapping data are not available. As part of Preliminary
Settlement Statement, Seller

 



      
 

 



 

shall provide to Buyer such data that Seller determines in its discretion is
necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing
the Closing Amount.

 



 

(b) Should Buyer receive after Closing any proceeds, income or other amounts
to which Seller is entitled under Section 2.7(a), Buyer shall fully disclose,
account for and promptly remit the same to Seller. If, after Closing, Seller
receives any proceeds, income or other amounts with respect to the Assets to
which Buyer is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Seller shall fully
disclose, account for, and promptly remit the same to Buyer.

 



 

(c) Should Buyer pay after Closing any Property Expenses for which Seller is
responsible under Section 2.7(a), Seller shall reimburse Buyer promptly after
receipt of an invoice with respect to such Property Expenses, accompanied by
copies of the relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment. Should
Seller pay after Closing any Property Expenses for which Buyer is responsible
under Section 2.7(a), Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly after receipt of
an invoice with respect to such Property Expenses, accompanied by copies of
relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment.

 



 

(d) After Closing, Buyer shall handle all joint interest audits and other
audits of Section 2.7(a Property Expenses covering the period for which Seller
is in whole or in part responsible under), provided that Buyer shall not agree
to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable
without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer shall provide Seller with a
copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by
Buyer and relating to periods for which Seller is wholly or partially
responsible.

 



 

ARTICLE 3.

 

BUYERS INSPECTION

 



 

3.1. _Due Diligence_. Subject to Section 3.3, upon execution of this
Agreement, Seller will make the Assets available to Buyer and its
representatives for inspection and review, at Buyers sole cost, to permit
Buyer to perform its due diligence ( ** _"Due Diligence Review"_** ) as
hereinafter provided. Buyer shall be entitled to conduct its Due Diligence
Review until 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on June 28, 2013(the **_"Due Diligence
Period"_** ). The notices pertaining to the Due Diligence Review for the
Notice of Defective Interest and the Environmental Defect Notice must be
received by Seller no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time three Business Days
after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (the **_"Defect Notice
Date"_** ).

 



 

3.2. _Access to Records_. Upon reasonable advance notice, the Records will be
made available to Buyer at the offices of Seller during Sellers normal
business hours. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Records relating to Non-Op
Properties will only be made available to Buyer to the extent such Records are
in Sellers possession, provided that Seller will cooperate with and assist
Buyer in obtaining copies of any Records not within Sellers possession
relating to the Non-Op Properties.

 



 

3.3. _On-Site Inspection_.

 



 

(a) Seller hereby consents to Buyer conducting, during the Due Diligence
Period and upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, at Buyers sole risk and
expense, on-site inspections and a Phase One Environmental Assessment (an
**_"Environmental Assessment"_** ) of

 



      
 

 



 

the Assets; provided, Buyers right to conduct due diligence on Assets
operated by any Person other than Seller (the **_"Non-Op Properties"_** )
shall be subject to obtaining such operators consent, which Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (but which efforts will not require
Seller to pay any consent fee to the operator or agree to give such operator
any other financial concession). Buyer shall not conduct any sampling, boring,
drilling or other invasive investigation activities upon the Assets ( **
_"Invasive Activities"_** ) without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, and, with respect to any Non-Op
Property, without the prior written consent of the third-party operator
thereof, which Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (but
which efforts will not require Seller to pay any consent fee to the operator
or agree to give such operator any other financial concession). If any
Environmental Assessment indicates that a Condition exists or is reasonably
likely to exist on any Asset, Buyer may request Sellers consent to conduct
Invasive Activities ( ** _"Inspection Request"_** ). The Inspection Request
shall include the specific Asset that would be subject to the Invasive
Activities, the reasons for requesting Invasive Activities and a description
of the proposed Invasive Activities to be conducted by Buyer. Seller shall
consent to or deny the Inspection Request within three (3) Business Days of
receipt of the Inspection Request, provided that consent from Seller shall not
be unreasonably withheld and that the failure of Seller to respond within such
three (3) Business Day period shall be deemed to constitute Sellers denial of
consent to the Inspection Request and the proposed Invasive Activities;
provided further, Buyers right to conduct Invasive Activities on any Non-Op
Property is also subject to the prior written consent of the third-party
operator of such property, which Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (but which efforts will not require Seller to pay any
consent fee to the operator or agree to give such operator any other financial
concession). If Seller withholds its consent to any Inspection Request
relating to an Asset with a Condition reasonably likely to exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold, then Buyer may elect to have Seller retain
the entirety of any such Asset at the Closing, in which event the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Asset.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have the right to have its representatives present at any
time that Buyer or any of its representatives are present on the Assets, and
Buyer will cooperate reasonably with Sellers scheduling requests so Seller or
its representatives can be present. In connection with any Environmental
Assessment or Invasive Activities, Buyer agrees not to interfere with the
normal operation of the Assets and agrees to comply with all requirements and
safety policies of the operator. If Buyer or its agents prepares an
Environmental Assessment or conducts Invasive Activities, Buyer will furnish a
copy of the assessment or report resulting therefrom to Seller. The Parties
shall execute a **_"common undertaking"_** letter regarding the
confidentiality of Environmental Assessments and Invasive Activities.

 



 

(c) During the Due Diligence Period, upon reasonable advance notice, Seller
shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to the persons set forth on
**_Schedule 3.3(c)_** during normal business hours, and shall instruct such
persons to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer in its Due
Diligence Review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Seller is
prohibited under an agreement currently binding on Seller to provide Buyer
access to an Asset or any Record, Sellers obligation to provide Buyer access
with respect to such Asset or Record shall be deemed satisfied by Seller using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission for Buyer or its
representatives to gain such access.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) As a condition to granting Buyer or any representative thereof access to
any Asset (including for the purpose of conducting Invasive Activities), Buyer
must present Seller with a customary insurance certificate confirming that it
is adequately insured and including the insurers waiver of subrogation of
Buyers or its representatives rights and claims against Seller. In addition,
as a condition to performing any Invasive Activities, such insurance
certificate must show Seller as an additional insured. Buyer hereby waives,
releases and agrees to defend and indemnify Seller and its directors,
officers, managers, employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives against
all claims for injury to, or death of, persons or for damage to property
arising in any way from the access afforded to Buyer hereunder or the
activities of Buyer or its representatives (including Invasive Activities).
This waiver, release and indemnity by Buyer shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

3.4. _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY
KIND AS TO ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 3,
INCLUDING THE RECORDS AND ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. BUYER AGREES THAT
ANY CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE RECORDS SHALL BE THE RESULT OF ITS OWN
INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND JUDGMENT.

 



 

ARTICLE 4.

 

TITLE MATTERS

 



 

4.1. _Seller s Title_.

 



 

(a) _Limited Defensible Title Representation_. Seller represents to Buyer that
(i) as of the Defect Notice Date its title to the Leases, Wells and Units is
Defensible Title, and (ii) to Sellers Knowledge, as of the date hereof,
**_Schedule 4.1(a)_** sets forth each individual Title Defect affecting any of
the Leases, Wells or Units with a Title Defect Amount in excess of the
Individual Title Threshold. Except as set forth in this Section 4.1(a) and in
the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance of Assets, attached hereto as
**_Exhibit E_** , Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to the Leases,
Wells, Units and other Assets. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with
respect to any of the Leases, Wells, Units and other Assets and for any breach
of Sellers representations in this Section 4.1(a) shall be Buyers right to
adjust the Purchase Price to the extent provided in this Article 4, and Buyer
hereby releases and waives all other remedies and agrees not to assert or
threaten to assert any claim with respect to any such waived remedies. The
representations in this Section 4.1(a) shall terminate as of the Defect Notice
Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter.

 



 

(b) _Defensible Title - Leases, Wells and Units_. The term **_"Defensible
Title"_** means such ownership of record to the Leases, Wells and Units that
is deducible from the applicable county, state and federal records such that a
reasonably prudent person engaged in the business of the ownership,
development and operation of oil and gas leasehold and properties and having
knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to
accept the same, and that, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances as
defined in Section 4.1(c):

 



      
 

 



 

(i) entitles Seller to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed from any Lease, Well or Unit throughout the duration of the
productive life of such Lease, Well or Unit or such specified zone(s) therein
after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating
royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by
production of Hydrocarbons (a **_"Net Revenue Interest"_** ), of not less than
the Net Revenue Interest share shown in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** ,
respectively, for such Lease, Well or Unit;

 



 

(ii) obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance, development, operation and the production relating to any Lease,
Well or Unit throughout the productive life of such Lease, Well or Unit ( **
_"Working Interest"_** ) not greater than the Working Interest shown in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively, for such Lease, Well or
Unit without increase, except increases to the extent that they are
accompanied by a proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue Interest;

 



 

(iii) each such Lease covers the Net Acre interest set forth in **_Exhibit
A_** ; and

 



 

(iv) is free and clear of Liens.

 



 

(c) _Permitted Encumbrances_. The term **_"Permitted Encumbrances"_** shall
mean:

 



 

(1) lessors royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests,
production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens if the net
cumulative effect of such burdens does not cause the Net Revenue Interest to
be less than or the Working Interest to be more than as set forth in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively, for the applicable Asset;

 



 

(2) statutory liens for Taxes that are not yet due and payable or that are
being contested in good faith in the normal course of business;

 



 

(3) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by Governmental Entities, in connection with the conveyance of the
applicable Asset if the same are customarily sought after such conveyance;

 



 

(4) rights of reassignment contained in any Leases, or assignments thereof,
providing for reassignment upon the surrender or expiration of any Leases;

 



 

(5) easements, rights of way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other
rights with respect to surface operations, pipelines, grazing, logging,
canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like, and easements for streets, alleys,
highways, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, railways and other
easements and rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of any of the Assets or
any restriction on access thereto that do not materially interfere with the
operation of the affected Asset;

 



 

(6) the terms and conditions of the Contracts listed in **_Exhibit C_** or any
compulsory pooling order of the North Dakota Industrial Commission; provided,
however, that the effect of any such items do not cause the Net Revenue
Interest to be

 



      
 

 



 

less than or the Working Interest to be more than as set forth in **_Exhibit
A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively, for the applicable Asset;

 



 

(7) materialmens, mechanics, operators or other similar liens arising in
the ordinary course of business (i) if such liens and charges have not been
filed pursuant to law and the time for filing such liens and charges has
expired, (ii) if filed, such liens and charges have not yet become due and
payable or payment is being withheld as provided by law, or (iii) if their
validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate action;

 



 

(8) such Title Defects (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) as Buyer has waived;

 



 

(9) any Liens burdening the Assets which will be released at or before
Closing; and

 



 

(10) any items set forth on **_Schedule 4.2(a)(9)_**.

 



 

4.2. _Purchase Price Adjustment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Title Defect_. As used in this Agreement, the term **_"Title Defect"_**
means any Lien, obligation (including contract obligation), defect, or other
matter (including without limitation a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or
Working Interest) that causes a breach of Sellers representation in Section
4.1(a) and that is not cured by Seller in the manner permitted by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be
considered Title Defects:

 



 

(1) defects based solely on lack of information in connection with documents
filed of record not contained in Sellers files;

 



 

(2) defects in the chain of title consisting of the mere failure to recite
marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate
proceedings, unless Buyer provides clear and convincing evidence that such
failure or omission has resulted in another Persons actual and superior claim
of title to the relevant Asset;

 



 

(3) defects arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly
required by applicable laws or regulations;

 



 

(4) defects asserting a change in Working Interest or Net Revenue Interest
based on a change in drilling and spacing units, tract allocation or other
changes in pool or unit participation occurring after the Effective Time by a
party other than Seller;

 



 

(5) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization
unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate or other entity
action was not authorized and results in another Persons actual and superior
claim of title to the relevant Asset;

 



      
 

 



 

(6) Liens created under deeds of trust, mortgages and similar instruments by
the lessor under a Lease covering the lessors surface and mineral interests
in the land covered thereby which would customarily be accepted in taking oil
and gas leases or purchasing undeveloped oil and gas leases and for which the
lessee would customarily seek a subordination of such Lien to the oil and gas
leasehold estate prior to conducting drilling activities on the Lease;

 



 

(7) defects based on failure to record a Lease issued by the Bureau of Land
Management or the North Dakota Board of University and School Lands, or any
assignments of record title or operating rights in such Leases, in the real
property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such Lease is
located;

 



 

(8) defects that have been cured by applicable laws of limitations,
prescription or otherwise; and

 



 

(9) any items set forth on **_Schedule 4.2(a)(9)_**.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit_. As used in this Agreement, the term **_"Title Benefit"_**
shall mean any right, circumstance or condition that operates (i) to increase
the Net Revenue Interest of Seller in any Lease, Well or Unit above that shown
in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively, to the extent the same
does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in Sellers Working
Interest therein above that shown in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** ,
respectively, (ii) to decrease the Working Interest of Seller in any Lease,
Well or Unit below that shown in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** ,
respectively, to the extent such decrease in Sellers Working Interest is
proportionately greater than the decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest
therein below that shown in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively,
or (iii) increase the Net Acres of Seller covered by the Lease above that
shown in **_Exhibit A_**.

 



 

(c) _Notice of Defective Interest_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that in Buyers reasonable
opinion constitute a Title Defect with respect to Sellers title to all or any
portion of the Leases, Wells and Units ( ** _"Notice of Defective
Interests"_** ). The Notice of Defective Interests shall be in writing, shall
identify the instrument as Buyers Notice of Defective Interests and shall
contain the following: (i) a reasonably clear, complete and accurate
description of the information in the possession of Buyer with respect to the
alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Leases, Wells or Units (and the applicable
zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title Defect(s) (each a **_"Title
Defect Property"_** ), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Lease, Well or Unit
subject to the alleged Title Defect(s), (iv) supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by
Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the
amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations
and information upon which Buyers belief is based. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer shall make
reasonable efforts to give Seller written notice of all Title Defects
discovered by Buyer at the end of each calendar week during the Due Diligence
Period; provided, however, any such written notice may be preliminary in
nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date, and the failure to
provide such preliminary notice shall not be deemed to waive or restrict
Buyers rights hereunder with respect to such Title Defect. Any matters that
may otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

constitute a Title Defect, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer
in accordance with this Section 4.2(c) prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall
be deemed to have been waived by Buyer.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Title Benefits_. Buyer will promptly furnish Seller with
written notice of any Title Benefit that is discovered by any of Buyers or
any of its Affiliates employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title
examiners while conducting Buyers Due Diligence Review prior to the Defect
Notice Date. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Seller shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to advise Buyer in writing of any matters that in
Sellers reasonable opinion constitute a Title Benefit with respect to
Sellers title to all or any portion of the Leases, Wells and Units (a
**_"Title Benefit Notice"_** ). The Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing
and contain the following: (i) a reasonably clear, complete and accurate
description of the information in the possession of the party providing such
notice with respect to the alleged Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Leases, Wells or
Units (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title
Benefit(s), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Lease, Well or Unit (and the
applicable zone(s) therein) subject to the alleged Title Benefit(s), (iv)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for such other party (as well as any
title attorney or examiner hired by such other party) to verify the existence
of the alleged Title Benefit(s), and (v) the amount by which the party
providing such Title Benefit Notice reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
such Leases, Wells or Units (and the applicable zone(s) therein) is increased
by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which such
belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of
which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Notice Date.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to
title dispute resolution under Section 4.3, in the event that any Title Defect
is timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.2(c) and is not
waived by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall elect, in its sole
discretion, from among the following:

 



 

(1) Seller may convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer at Closing and reduce
the Purchase Price by an amount determined pursuant to Section 4.2(i) and
retain the right to cure the Title Defect after Closing;

 



 

(2) Seller may exclude the Title Defect Property from the transaction and
reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value for such
Title Defect Property (and the Individual Title Threshold and Aggregate Title
Deductible shall be disregarded and therefore not applied for purposes of this
Purchase Price reduction); or

 



 

(3) with the consent of Buyer, make no adjustment to the Purchase Price and
indemnify Buyer against all liability, loss, cost and expense resulting from
such Title Defect, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification
Agreement attached hereto as **_Exhibit H_**.

 



 

(f) _Title Defect Amount_. The **_"Title Defect Amount"_** means the amount by
which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title
Defect is reduced

 



      
 

 



 

as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(1) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(2) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to
remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property; and

 



 

(3) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (1) or (2) above, the Title Defect Amount shall
be determined by taking into account the following factors: (i) any
discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest for any
Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest
stated in **_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_** , respectively; (ii) the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (iii) the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the
Title Defect; (v) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller;
(vi) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Acre interest covered by a Lease and
(B) the Net Acre interest covered by such Lease stated in **_Exhibit A_** ;
and (vii) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 



 

(g) _Individual Title Threshold_. Except as provided in Section 4.2(e)(2), (i)
there shall be no adjustment (upwards or downwards) to the Purchase Price for
any individual Title Defect or any individual Title Benefit, the Title Defect
Amount of which or the Title Benefit Amount of which, respectively, does not
exceed $100,000 ( ** _"Individual Title Threshold"_** ).

 



 

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the same methodology, terms and
conditions for determining the Title Defect Amount.

 



 

(i) _Title Adjustment Amount_. If the aggregate Title Defect Amount of all
Title Defects (disregarding any Title Defect whose Title Defect Amount is less
than $100,000) exceeds the aggregate Title Benefit Amount of all Title
Benefits (disregarding any Title Benefit whose Title Benefit Amount is less
than $100,000), then the Purchase Price shall be reduced to the extent (and
only to the extent) such excess exceeds $9,900,000. If the aggregate Title
Benefit Amount of all Title Benefits (disregarding any Title Benefit whose
Title Benefit Amount is less than $100,000) exceeds the aggregate Title Defect
Amount of all Title Defects (disregarding any Title Defect whose Title Defect
Amount is less than $100,000), then the Purchase Price shall be increased to
the extent (and only to the extent) such excess exceeds $9,900,000. The amount
by which the Purchase Price is adjusted under this Section 4.2(i) shall be
referred to as the "Title

 



       
 

 



 

Adjustment Amount," and the Title Adjustment Amount shall be recalculated from
time to time to take into account Title Defect cured in accordance with this
Agreement and the resolution of Disputed Title Defects and Disputed Title
Benefits. Buyer, at its sole discretion, may elect to waive all or any portion
of any Title Defect as to Buyer, so as to reduce the aggregate Title
Adjustment Amount below the percentage that would prevent termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 in which case any waived Title Defect (or
portion thereof) shall no longer form the basis for a downward adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

 



 

(j) _Seller s Right to Cure_.

 



 

(1) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to Closing (the "Cure Period")
any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.

 



 

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.2, if there is a reduction in
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.2(i), then Seller shall retain the
right but not the obligation for one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date to attempt to cure any Title Defect at Sellers sole cost. At
Sellers request, Buyer will cooperate in all reasonable respects with
Sellers curative efforts. If Seller cures any such Title Defect such that
such Title Defect no longer exists or in a manner otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, then the Title Adjustment Amount shall be recalculated,
and Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall make a true-up payment to the other
based on such recalculated Title Adjustment Amount and taking into account all
prior adjustments to the Purchase Price based on Title Defects and Title
Benefits. Amounts required to be paid by one party to the other pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall first be satisfied from any Title Escrow Amount
(and Buyer and Seller shall issue a joint instruction letter to the Escrow
Agent regarding prompt payment of the Title Defect Amount in the amount of
such true-up obligation to Seller). If the Title Defect Amount is not
sufficient to satisfy either partys true-up obligation in full, such party
shall satisfy the balance of such obligation by making an out of pocket cash
payment to the other party.

 



 

4.3. _Title Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree to resolve disputes
concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section 4.3: (i) the
existence and scope of a Title Defect, Title Benefit or Title Adjustment
Amount, (ii) the Title Defect Amount of that portion of the Asset affected by
a Title Defect and (iii) the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative
efforts as to whether such Title Defect continues to exist or Buyers
reasonable satisfaction of such efforts (the **_"Title Disputed Matters"_** ).
The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all Title Disputed Matters
through good faith negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve a Title Defect
or Title Benefit dispute on or before Closing (each, a **_"Disputed Title
Defect"_** and a **_"Disputed Title Benefit,"_** respectively), solely for
purposes determining the Closing Amount (and subject to true-up as such
disputed items are resolved), the Title Adjustment Amount shall be calculated
(x) as if Buyers position on each Disputed Title Defect were correct and as
if Sellers position with respect to each Disputed Title Benefit were correct
(the **_"Closing Date Title Adjustment Amount"_** ) and (y) as if Sellers
position on each Disputed Title Defect were correct and as if Buyers position
with respect to each Disputed Title Benefit were correct (the **_"Hypothetical
Title Adjustment Amount"_** ). The difference between the Closing Date Title
Adjustment Amount and the Hypothetical Adjustment Amount representing the
greatest dollar amount in

 



      
 

 



 

dispute, is referred to herein as the **_"Title Escrow Amount"_** and, at
Closing, shall be paid by Buyer to the Escrow Agent to be held as part of the
Additional Escrow Amount. Further, the Title Disputed Matters will be finally
determined by binding arbitration pursuant to Section 15.13, _provided
however_ , that the independent arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 15.13
shall be an oil and gas title attorney licensed in North Dakota with a minimum
of ten (10) years experience with title defects affecting the types of
properties which are the subject of the Title Disputed Matters. The arbitrator
shall employ such independent attorneys, petroleum engineers and/or other
consultants as deemed necessary. On or before forty-five (45) days after
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall present their respective positions in writing
to the arbitrator, together with such evidence as each Party deems
appropriate. The arbitrator shall be instructed to resolve the dispute through
a final decision within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in
dispute and the final decision may be reflected in the Final Settlement
Statement. Upon final resolution of each Title Disputed Matter, the Title
Adjustment Amount shall be recalculated, and Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
shall make a true-up payment to the other based on such recalculated Title
Adjustment Amount and taking into account all prior adjustments to the
Purchase Price and true-up payments based on the prior resolution and prior
cure of all Titled Defects and Title Benefits. Amounts required to be paid by
one party to the other pursuant to the preceding sentence shall first be
satisfied from any Title Escrow Amount (and Buyer and Seller shall issue a
joint instruction letter to the Escrow Agent regarding prompt payment of the
Title Defect Amount in the amount of such true-up obligation to Seller). If
the Title Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy either partys true-up
obligation in full, such party shall satisfy the balance of such obligation by
making an out of pocket cash payment to the other party.

 



 

4.4. _Preferential Rights and Consents_. As of the date hereof, Seller has
identified the preferential purchase rights and consents to assignment listed
on **_Schedule 4.4_** that may be triggered by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The remedies set forth in this Section 4.4 are the
exclusive remedies under this Agreement for consents to assign and
preferential rights to purchase affecting the Assets that are disclosed on
**_Schedule 4.4_** or are discovered by the Parties prior to the Closing. An
Asset affected by a Material Consent or preferential right to purchase that is
outstanding at Closing shall be referred to as an **_"Affected Asset"_**.

 



 

(a) _Consents_. Promptly after execution hereof, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to send notices to those Persons necessary to request all
Material Consents to assignment of the Assets. If prior to Closing, Seller
fails to obtain a consent to assign that would invalidate the conveyance of
the Asset affected by the consent to assign or materially affect the value or
use of the Asset (a **_"Material Consent"_** ) and the failure to obtain such
Material Consent has not been waived by Buyer, then Seller shall retain the
Affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of the Affected Asset. If such Material Consent is obtained on or before the
Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey the Affected Asset to Buyer
effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated
Value of the Affected Asset, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. If such Material Consent is not obtained on or before the
Final Settlement Date, the Affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale and
the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Affected Asset. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller in obtaining any Material Consent, including providing assurances of
reasonable financial

 



      
 

 



 

conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make any other
type of financial commitments as a condition of obtaining such Material
Consent.

 



 

(b) _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give notices required in connection with preferential purchase
rights prior to Closing. If any preferential right to purchase any portion of
the Assets is exercised prior to the Closing Date, then the Affected Assets
shall be excluded from the sale and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Affected Assets. If
by Closing, either (i) the time frame for the exercise of a preferential
purchase right has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent
not to exercise or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, or (ii) a
third party exercises its preferential right to purchase, but the time frame
for consummation of the preferential purchase right has not expired prior to
the Closing, then Seller shall retain the Affected Assets and the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Affected Assets. As to any Affected Assets retained by Seller hereunder,
following Closing if a preferential right to purchase is not consummated
within the time frame specified in the preferential purchase right, or if the
time frame for exercise of the preferential purchase right expires without
exercise after the Closing, Seller shall promptly convey the Affected Assets
to Buyer, effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay the
Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE 5. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 



 

5.1. _Exclusive Remedy_. Section 5.4 shall be the exclusive right and remedy
of Buyer with respect to the existence of any Condition or Sellers failure to
comply with Environmental Laws with respect to the Leases, Wells, Units and
other Assets. Seller represents to Buyer that, to Sellers Knowledge, as of
the date hereof, there is no individual Environmental Defect affecting any of
the Assets with an Environmental Defect Amount in excess of the Individual
Environmental Threshold. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers
sole remedy for any Environment Defect or breach of any representation in this
Section 5.1 shall be the remedies provided in Section 5.4, and Buyer hereby
releases and waives all other remedies and agrees not to assert or threaten to
assert any claim with respect to any such waived remedies. The representations
in this Section 5.1 shall terminate as of the Defect Notice Date and shall
have no further force and effect thereafter.

 



 

5.2. _Environmental Liabilities and Obligations_. Upon Closing, Buyer agrees
to assume and pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all Environmental
Liabilities. Any Environmental Defect raised by Buyer in an Environmental
Defect Notice shall be an Environmental Liability, except with respect to
Assets excluded from the transaction hereunder; provided, however, nothing in
this Section 5.2 shall limit the ability of the Parties to adjust the Purchase
Price pursuant to the terms of Section 5.4.

 



 

5.3. _Environmental Defect Notice_. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that in Buyers reasonable
opinion constitute an Environmental Defect ( ** _"Environmental Defect
Notice"_** ). The Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing, shall
identify the instrument as Sellers Environmental Defect Notice and contain
the following: (i) a reasonably clear, complete and accurate description of
the

 



      
 

 



 

information in the possession of Buyer with respect to the alleged
Environmental Defect(s), (ii) the Assets affected by the alleged Environmental
Defect(s) (each an **_"Environmental Defect Property"_** ), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property, (iv) supporting
documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any consultant hired by
Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), and
(v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each
Environmental Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Environmental
Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Buyers belief is
based.

 



 

5.4. _Defect Adjustments_. Upon delivery of a timely Environmental Defect
Notice, the Parties shall proceed as follows:

 



 

(a) With respect to each Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer, Seller
may, at its sole discretion, elect, on or prior to the Closing Date, to (1)
reach agreement with Buyer on the existence of the Environmental Defect and an
adjustment to the Purchase Price which shall be reflected on the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, which adjustment shall reflect the cost to Remediate
such Environmental Defect ( ** _"Environmental Defect Amount"_** ); or (2)
elect to challenge the existence and/or scope of the Environmental Defect
and/or Environmental Defect Amount asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.4(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event the Environmental Defect Amount reasonably asserted by Buyer in the
Environmental Defect Notice exceeds the Allocated Value for such Environmental
Defect Property, Buyer or Seller may elect to exclude the Environmental Defect
Property from the transaction and reduce to the Purchase Price by the amount
of the Allocated Value for such Environmental Defect Property, without giving
effect to the Individual Environmental Threshold and Aggregate Environmental
Deductible. If Seller elects to challenge the existence and/or scope of the
Environmental Defect and/or the Environmental Defect Amount pursuant to this
Section 5.4 (the **_"Environmental Disputed Matters_** "), and such dispute
has not been resolved as of the Closing Date and the parties have not elected
to exclude the Environmental Defect Property from the transaction contemplated
hereunder as provided in the proceeding sentence, then the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property
(such amount, the ** _"Environmental Escrow Amount"_** ), and, at Closing,
Buyer shall pay such Environmental Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent. Further,
the Environmental Disputed Matters will be finally determined by binding
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 15.13. With
respect to disputes concerning Environmental Defects, the arbitrator shall be
qualified by education, knowledge and experience with environmental defects
affecting the types of properties which are subject to the disputed
Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Amount and have a minimum of ten
(10) years experience with such types of defects and properties. The
arbitrator shall employ such independent attorneys and/or other consultants as
deemed necessary. On or before forty-five (45) days after Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall present their respective positions in writing to the arbitrator,
together with such evidence as each Party deems appropriate. The arbitrator
shall be instructed to resolve the dispute through a final decision within
twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute, and the final
decision may be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement. Upon final
resolution of any Environmental Disputed Matter, the Escrow Agent shall,
pursuant to Section 2.5, deliver the applicable Environmental Escrow Amount
out of the Additional Escrow Amount in accordance with the decision of the
arbitrator.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) there shall be no adjustments to
the Purchase Price for any individual Environmental Defect for which the
Environmental Defect Amount does not exceed $100,000 ( ** _"Individual
Environmental Threshold_** "); and (ii) there shall be no adjustments to the
Purchase Price for any Environmental Defect that exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless the Environmental Defect Amount of all such
Environmental Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any Environmental Defects
cured by Seller, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to $9,900,000 (the
**_"Aggregate Environmental Deductible"_** ), after which point Buyer shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with
respect to such Environmental Defect Amounts in excess of such Aggregate
Environmental Deductible (the **_"Environmental Adjustment Amount"_** );
provided, however, that Buyer, at its sole discretion, may elect to waive all
or any portion of any Environmental Defect as to Buyer, so as to reduce the
aggregate Environmental Adjustment Amount below the percentage that would
prevent termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.

 



 

ARTICLE 6. 
SELLERS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 



 

Except as set forth in the schedule delivered to Buyer prior to the execution
of this Agreement setting forth specific exceptions to Sellers
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty by
Seller) (the **_"Disclosed Materials"_** ), Seller represents and warrants to
Buyer as follows:

 



 

6.1. _Status_. Seller is a limited liability company duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is
qualified to carry on its business in such other jurisdictions as may be
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

6.2. _Power_. Seller has all requisite limited liability company power and
authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, to enter into this
Agreement, and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the performance of Sellers
obligations hereunder will not, as of Closing, violate, or be in conflict
with, any provision of Sellers governing documents, or any judgment, decree,
order, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Seller; provided, no
representation is made in this Section 6.2 with respect to the assignability
of the Assets under applicable law as such subject matter is covered
exclusively by Sections 4.4 and 6.19.

 



 

6.3. _Authorization and Enforceability_. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer, this Agreement constitutes Sellers legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject, however, to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other laws for the protection of
creditors, as well as to general principles of equity, regardless whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4. _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Seller has not incurred any liability,
contingent or otherwise, for investment bankers, brokers or finders fees
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Buyer
shall have any responsibility whatsoever.

 



 

6.5. _Litigation_. Except as provided on **_Schedule 6.5_** , there are no
material actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, against Seller (with respect to the Assets) or any of the Assets,
in any court or by or before any Governmental Entity.

 



 

6.6. _Material Agreements_. Except for the Leases, **_Exhibit C_** includes
all of the following types of contracts (the **_"Material Agreements"_** ) by
which any of the Assets are bound as of the date hereof: (a) any agreement
with any Affiliate of Seller; (b) any agreement or contract for the sale,
exchange, or other disposition of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable
to Sellers interest in the Assets or for the purchase, processing or
transportation of any Hydrocarbons, in each case that is not cancelable
without penalty or other payment on not more than 60 days prior written
notice, other than terms of operating agreements or gas balancing agreements
which permit an operator or other co owner to take or market production of a
non taking co owner; (c) any agreement of or binding upon Seller to sell,
lease, farmout, or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the Assets
after the date hereof, other than nonconsent penalties for nonparticipation in
operations under operating agreements, conventional rights of reassignment
arising in connection with Sellers surrender or release of any of the Assets;
(d) any Tax partnership agreement of or binding upon Seller affecting any of
the Assets; (e) any agreement that creates any area of mutual interest or
similar provision with respect to the Assets, (f) any agreement that requires
expenditures in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate in any twelve month period
beginning on or after the date hereof, and (g) any joint operating agreement
or joint development agreement to which Seller is a party that relates to the
Assets. Seller is not (and to Sellers Knowledge, no other Person is) in
material default (or with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
would not be in default) under any Material Agreement except as disclosed on
**_Exhibit C_**. Prior to execution of this Agreement, Seller has provided
Buyer or made available to Buyer, true, correct and complete copies of the
Material Agreements. The Material Agreements are in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and valid and binding obligation of Seller, and
to Sellers Knowledge each of the other parties thereto, and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by equitable principles.

 



 

6.7. _Capital Projects_. Except as described on **_Schedule 6.7_** ( **
_"Capital Projects"_** ), as of the date hereof, (i) Seller has incurred no
expenses, and has made no commitments to make expenditures in connection with
the ownership or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time (other than
with respect to routine operations performed in the ordinary course of
operating the existing Wells), which expenditures are, individually, estimated
to cost in excess of (A) $250,000, net to Sellers interest, with respect to
any Non-Op Property, or (B) $100,000, net to Sellers interest, with respect
to any Asset operated by Seller, and (ii) no contractual obligations,
proposals or authorities for expenditures are currently outstanding (whether
made by Seller or by any other party) to drill additional wells, or to deepen,
plug back, rework any Well, to abandon any Well, or to conduct any other
operation on the Assets for which the estimated cost exceeds (A) $250,000, net
to Sellers interest, with respect to any Non-Op Property or (B) $100,000, net
to Sellers interest, with respect to any Asset operated by Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8. _Taxes_. The Seller has paid all Taxes pertaining to the Assets,
including, without limitation, the ownership and operation of the Assets, that
have become due, unless such Taxes are being contested in good-faith in
appropriate proceedings. There are no Tax liens (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) on any of the Assets. Seller has not received written notice of
any pending claim against or audit of Seller from any taxing authority for the
assessment of any material Tax pertaining to the Assets that, if unpaid, could
give rise to a lien or other claim against any of the Assets.

 



 

6.9. _Audits_. Except as provided on **_Schedule 6.9_** , there are no audits
currently being conducted by Seller of the joint account under any operating
agreements related to the Assets nor are there any such audits of Seller
currently underway.

 



 

6.10. _Judgments_. There are no unsatisfied judgments or injunctions issued by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity outstanding
against Seller related to the Assets.

 



 

6.11. _Compliance with Law And Government Authorizations_. Seller is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 6.11 does not relate to Taxes and Environmental
Laws.

 



 

6.12. _Lease Status/Rentals/Royalties/Exhibits_. All rentals, royalties and
operating expenses payable with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective
Time have been duly and properly paid in all material respects and there are
no currently pending material requests or demands for payments, adjustments of
payments or performance pursuant to obligations under the Leases relating to
Assets, provided however, that this representation is qualified by Sellers
Knowledge to the extent that such representation relates to Non-Op Properties.
**_Exhibit A_** contains a complete list of all oil and gas leases under
which Seller holds an interest in the State of North Dakota as of the date
hereof, including the expiration dates of the primary terms of the Leases.

 



 

6.13. _Well Status_. Except as set forth in **_Schedule 6.13_** , there are no
wells located on the Assets that: (a) Seller is obligated by Law or contract
to currently plug and abandon; or (b) to the extent plugged and abandoned,
have not been plugged in accordance with applicable material requirements of
each Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Assets.

 



 

6.14. _Calls on Production_. Except as set forth on **_Schedule 6.14_** ,
Seller has not (i) received any material advance, "take-or-pay" or other
similar payments under production sales contracts that entitle the purchasers
to "make up" or otherwise receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying at
such time the contract price therefore or (ii) taken or received any amount
of Hydrocarbons under any gas balancing agreements or any similar arrangements
not accounted for in a purchase price adjustment that permit any Person
thereafter to receive any portion of the interest of Seller to "balance" any
disproportionate allocation of Hydrocarbons. Except as set forth on
**_Schedule 6.14_** , no Hydrocarbons attributable to the Assets are subject
to a sales contract (other than contracts terminable on no more than thirty
(30) days notice or in accordance with rights of termination by non-operators
under the applicable joint operating agreement) and no Person has any call
upon, option to purchase or similar rights with respect to the production from
the Assets; production from the Assets is not bound by any gas dedications

 



      
 

 



 

or subject to any monetary or in kind through-put fees or charges in
connection with gathering or transportation; and the Assets are not bound by
futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap, option or other contracts
that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk
of fluctuations in the price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons,
securities, foreign exchange rates or interest rates that will continue after
Closing. To Sellers Knowledge, proceeds from the sale of oil, condensate, and
gas from the Assets are being received by Seller, as applicable, in a timely
manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason. The representations
in this Section 6.14 are qualified by Sellers Knowledge to the extent such
representations relate to Non-Op Properties.

 



 

6.15. _Bankruptcy_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or similar
arrangement proceedings pending, being contemplated by, or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened against Seller.

 



 

6.16. _Indebtedness_. Except as set forth on **_Schedule 8.1(f)_** , there is
no Indebtedness currently outstanding in respect of the Assets. Seller is not
in default in payment of any such Indebtedness with respect to which it is an
obligor nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, is Seller in material default of any
covenant, agreement, representation, warranty or other term of any document,
instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise pertaining to any
such Indebtedness.

 



 

6.17. _Financial Assurances and Guarantees_. Except as set forth on
**_Schedule 6.17_** , neither Seller nor any Affiliate has obtained or issued
any guarantees, letters of credit, letters of comfort, surety bonds, self-
bonds, performance bonds, reclamation bonds or other similar financial
assurances relating to the Assets.

 



 

6.18. _Assets Subject to Reversionary Rights_. Except as described on
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit B_**, none of the Lands or Leases are subject
to the rights of third parties to receive a reversionary interest, the effect
of which would be to reduce the net revenue interest of a Well or a well
drilled in the future on any Lands or Leases, and **_Schedule 6.18_** sets
forth, as of March 31, 2013, (i) the Sellers good faith estimate of the
payout balance with respect to the reversionary interests described in
footnote (a) on **_Exhibit A_** and **_Exhibit B_** and (ii) the payout
balance provided by the operator with respect to the reversionary interests
described in footnotes (b) and (c) on **_Exhibit A_** and **_Exhibit B_**.

 



 

6.19. _Rights in Third Parties_. Except as set forth on **_Schedule 4.4_** ,
there are no preferential purchase rights or, to the Sellers Knowledge,
Material Consents that relate to the Assets and would be triggered by the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.20. _Off-Site Disposal_. To Sellers Knowledge, Seller has not arranged for
disposal of any Hazardous Materials, at sites off of or otherwise not
connected to the Assets for which Remediation is required by any Environmental
Law; _provided that_ this representation does not include any such materials
that may have migrated from or beneath the Assets through soil, groundwater or
other media.

 



 

6.21. _No Other Representations or Warranties; Disclosed Materials_. Except
for the representations and warranties contained in this Article 6 (as
qualified by the Disclosed

 



      
 

 



 

Materials), neither Seller nor any other Person makes (and Buyer is not
relying upon) any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Seller (including the value, condition or use of any Asset) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Seller disclaims any other
representations or warranties not contained in this Article 6 whether made by
Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or any of their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees or agents. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article 6 (as qualified by the Disclosed
Materials), Seller disclaims all liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement or information made,
communicated or furnished (orally or in writing) to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any of its officers, directors, managers, employees or agents
(including any opinion, information, projection or advice that may have been
or may be provided to Buyer by any director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of Seller or any of its Affiliates). The
disclosure of any matter or item in the Disclosed Materials shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be
disclosed or is material or that such matter would or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

6.22. _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY WARRANTED, REPRESENTED OR COVENANTED
OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN

judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Buyer.

 



 

7.3. _Authorization and Enforceability_. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Seller, this Agreement constitutes Buyers legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject, however, to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

general principles of equity, regardless whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

contingent or otherwise, for investment bankers, brokers or finders fees
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller

liabilities to be assumed by it under this Agreement.

 



 

7.6. _Financial Resources_. At the Closing, Buyer shall have the financial
resources available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay the Purchase Price and any and all fees and expenses
incurred by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Records and materials made available to it by Seller in Sellers offices with
respect to the Assets. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has not made any
representations or warranties as to the Records or otherwise except as
expressly and specifically provided herein and that Buyer may not rely on any
of Sellers estimates with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to reserves, the value of the Assets, projections as to future events
or other internal analyses or forward looking statements.

 



 

(b) _Independent Evaluation_. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer
acknowledges and affirms that it has relied and will rely solely on the terms
of this Agreement and upon its independent analysis, evaluation and
investigation of, and judgment with respect to, the business, economic, legal,
tax or other consequences of this transaction including without limitation its
own estimate and appraisal of the extent and value of the Hydrocarbon reserves
of the Assets.

 



 

ARTICLE 8. 
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 



 

8.1. _Covenants and Agreements of Seller_. Seller covenants and agrees with
Buyer as follows:

 



 

(a) _Operations Prior to Closing_. Except as otherwise consented to in writing
by Buyer or provided in this Agreement, from the date of execution of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller will operate the Assets which it
operates in a manner consistent in all material respects with past practice.
From the date of execution of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller shall
pay or cause to be paid in the ordinary course of business its proportionate
share of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such operations.
Seller will notify Buyer of capital expenditures anticipated to cost in excess
of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per operation, net to
Sellers interest, conducted on the Assets, other than those listed on **
_Schedule 6.7_**. All costs and expenses incurred by the Parties with respect
to the Capital Projects will be apportioned between the Parties as of the
Effective Time, with Buyer assuming all post-Effective Time costs and expenses
and Seller retaining all pre-Effective Time costs and expenses.

 



 

(b) _Restriction on Operations_. Subject to Section 8.1(a) and except as
otherwise provided in this Section 8.1(b), unless Seller obtains the prior
written consent of Buyer to act otherwise, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts within the constraints of the applicable operating
agreements and other applicable agreements not to: (i) abandon any part of the
Assets (except in the ordinary course of business, Leases that have terminated
in the ordinary course of business based upon the expiration of their primary
terms, or Leases that are no longer capable of production in paying
quantities); (ii) except for the Capital Projects listed on **_Schedule 6.7_**
and operations consistent with the existing drilling plan attached hereto as
**_Schedule 8.1(b)_** , approve any operations on the Assets anticipated in
any instance to cost more than $250,000 per activity, net to Sellers interest
(excepting emergency operations required under presently existing contractual
obligations, ongoing commitments under existing AFEs and operations undertaken
to avoid a monetary penalty or forfeiture provision of any applicable
agreement or order all of which shall be deemed to be approved, provided
Seller immediately notifies Buyer of any emergency operation or operation to
avoid monetary penalty or forfeiture excepted herein); (iii) convey or dispose
of any part of the Assets (other than replacement of equipment or sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from the Assets in the ordinary course of business);
(iv) enter into any Material Agreement in respect of an Asset, or materially

settlements, and appeals, which can reasonably be expected to materially
affect the ownership, operation or value of the Assets after the Closing Date;
or (viii) issue any note, bond, or other debt instrument secured by the
Assets or agree to the imposition of any security interest or Lien on the
Assets or allow any encumbrance which would impose a security interest or Lien
on account of unpaid amounts upon any of the Assets that will not be repaid at
the Closing.

 



 

(c) _Consents_. For the purposes of obtaining the written consents for AFEs
required in this Section 8.1, Buyer designates the following contact person:

Section 15.3. Such consents may be obtained in writing by overnight courier or
given by .pdf or facsimile transmission.

 



 

(d) _Notices of Claims_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer, if, between the
date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller receives
written notice of any claim, suit, action or other proceeding made against
Seller which materially affects the Assets or alleges any material default
under any Material Agreement affecting the Assets. Seller shall notify Buyer
of any written proposal from a third party to engage in any material
transaction (e.g., a farmout) with respect to the Assets.

 



 

(e) _Suspense Accounts_. Prior to Closing, Seller will provide to Buyer (a)
information regarding all of Sellers accounts holding moneys in suspense
together with a written explanation (as contained in Sellers files) of why
such moneys are held in suspense or other information identifying the proper
disposition of such moneys and (b) Sellers division of interest and all
supporting documentation regarding those royalty owners and working interest
owners in the Leases for whom Seller disburses proceeds of production. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for the proper distribution of such moneys held in
suspense to the party or parties which or who are entitled to receive payment
of the same, and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless
from any Claims therefor.

 



 

(f) _Pay-Off Letters; Release of Indebtedness_. Seller will request each
holder of Indebtedness set forth on **_Schedule 8.1(f)_ **to prepare and
deliver to Buyer the Pay-Off Letters, no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, setting forth (i) the amounts required to be paid
at the Closing to the holder of such Indebtedness pursuant to the terms of
such Indebtedness and (ii) the commitment of such creditor to release all
Liens, if any, which they may hold on any of the Assets immediately upon
receipt of all payments validly owing to each holder of Indebtedness as
provided for in the Pay-Off Letters, which Pay-Off Letters will be updated, as
necessary, prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(1) Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate
with Parent, as and when needed in connection with the preparation of the Base

respect thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(2) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall

and/or review of financial statements required under applicable Law and
applicable to Parent or its Affiliates with respect to the Assets.

 



 

8.2. _Covenants and Agreements of Buyer_. Buyer shall use all reasonable
efforts to assure that as of the Closing Date it will not be under any
material legal or contractual restriction that would prohibit or delay the
timely consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.3. _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties._

 



 

(a) _Confidentiality_. The Parties are currently subject to a previously
executed Confidentiality Agreement dated March 3, 2013, which covers the
confidential information of Seller, and will remain in full force and effect
following execution of this Agreement, except to the extent in conflict with
the terms of this Agreement (and in the case of such a conflict, the terms of
this Agreement shall control), and will control in the event of a termination
of this Agreement. No press release or public announcement related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein shall be issued or made by
any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless, based
on the advice of counsel, such disclosure may be required by Law or the rules
of any exchange upon which the common shares of the Buyer are then listed. The
Parties shall consult with each other on the contents of the press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement and the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed
by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is taken or threatened
to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (" **
_Casualty Loss_** "), Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase such Asset. If
Buyer declines to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of such Asset. If Buyer elects to purchase such Asset, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset
(with equipment of similar utility), less all insurance proceeds which shall
be payable to Buyer, up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being
the " ** _Net Casualty Loss_** "). Seller, at its sole option, may elect to
cure such Casualty Loss and, in such event, Seller shall be entitled to all
insurance proceeds. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Seller may
replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with
equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any real property with real
property of similar nature and kind if such property is acceptable to Buyer in
its sole discretion. If Seller elects to cure the Casualty Loss, Buyer shall
purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation and Good Faith_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will use their respective
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Party or Parties
hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions, including using reasonable efforts to: (i) cause the conditions
set forth in Article 10 to be satisfied and (ii) execute or deliver any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing
provisions of this Section 8.3(c) will not require (y) any Party to perform,
satisfy or discharge any obligations of any other Party under this Agreement
or otherwise or (z) Seller to pay any money or other consideration or grant
forbearances to any third party in order to perform, satisfy or discharge any
of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Successor Operator_. Promptly after Closing, at Buyers request, Seller
shall send notices (in form mutually agreed to by Buyer) to co-owners, if any,
of those Assets that Seller currently operates stating that Seller is
resigning as operator, effective upon the Closing Date, and providing notice
that Buyer shall become (or to the extent governed by an operating agreement
or similar agreement, recommending that Buyer be elected) successor operator
for the Assets operated by Seller. Seller makes no representations or
warranties to Buyer as to the transferability of operatorship of any Assets
which Seller currently operates. Rights and obligations associated with
operatorship of the Assets may be governed by operating agreements or similar
agreements and will be decided in accordance with the terms of such
agreements.

 



 

ARTICLE 9. 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

9.1. _Production Tax Liability_. Subject to the treatment of ad valorem Taxes
provided below, all Production Taxes shall be allocated between Buyer and
Seller as of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the
Effective Time. All Production Taxes that are not ad valorem taxes shall be
allocated to Seller to the extent they relate to production prior to the
Effective Time and to Buyer to the extent they relate to production on or
after the Effective Time. No liability for Production Taxes shall duplicate an
adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 2.6. Ad valorem
Taxes for each assessment period shall be allocated to Seller based on the
percentage of the assessment period occurring before the Effective Time and to
Buyer based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or after
the Effective Time. Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other copies of
any Production Tax assessments and statements (or invoices therefore from the
operator of the Assets) received by it to the extent such assessment,
statement, or invoice relates to a Production Tax allocable to the other Party
under this Section. Each Party shall timely pay all Production Taxes subject
to allocation under this Section and shall furnish to the other Party evidence
of such payment. The Parties shall estimate all Taxes (excluding Sellers
income, franchise, or margin Taxes) attributable to the ownership or operation
of the Assets to the extent they relate to the period on and after the
Effective Time and through the Closing Date and all Transfer Taxes and
incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from the estimates
included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and are known at the time of
the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement
Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best
information available at the time of the Final Settlement Statement. When the
actual amounts are known, Buyer or Seller shall make such payments to the
other (if any) as are necessary to effect the allocation of Taxes described in
this Section 9.1.

 



      
 

 



 

9.2. _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use or other Taxes (other than Taxes on
gross income, net income or gross receipts) and duties, levies, recording fees
or other governmental charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the
property transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement (" ** _Transfer
Taxes_** ") shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer
provided that, in the event that Seller pays any Transfer Tax Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller for such payment (without duplication to any
adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 2.6). The Parties
shall reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or eliminate
any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

9.3. _Tax Reports and Returns_. For Tax periods in which the Effective Time
occurs, Seller agrees to forward to Buyer within five (5) days of receipt
copies of any Tax reports and returns received or filed by Seller after
Closing and provide Buyer with any information Seller has that is reasonably
necessary for Buyer to file any required Tax Return related to the Assets.
Buyer agrees to file all Tax Returns and reports applicable to the Assets that
Buyer is required to file after the Closing and, subject to the provisions of
Section 9.1, to pay all required Production Taxes payable with respect to the
Assets.

 



 

9.4. _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each, a " **
_Tax Proceeding_** ") with respect to Taxes relating to or in connection with
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of such records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement. The date upon which
such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is
established shall be herein called the " ** _Final Settlement Date_**." If the
Final Purchase Price is more than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer shall
pay to Seller the amount of such difference by wire transfer in immediately
available funds no later than five (5) days after the Final Settlement Date.
If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price,
Seller shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyer by wire transfer in
immediately available funds no later than five (5) days after the Final
Settlement Date.

 



 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute as to
the Final Purchase Price within sixty (60) days after Buyers receipt of
Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement, the Parties shall submit the
dispute to binding arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of Section 15.13.

 



 

13.2. _Records_. Seller shall make the Records available for pick up by Buyer
at Closing to the extent possible, but in any event, within thirty (30) days
after Closing. Seller may retain copies of the Records and Seller shall have
the right to review and copy the Records during standard business hours upon
reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records, which shall be a
period of not less than six (6) years. Buyer agrees that the Records will be
maintained in compliance with all applicable Laws governing document
retention.

 



       
 

 



 

13.3. _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further
instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested in order
to accomplish more effectively the purposes of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

13.4. _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._

 



 

(a) Seller shall cause all Tax Returns required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date with respect to the Assets or production of Hydrocarbons from the
Assets to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to
be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of Seller to the extent
permitted by Law. Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of completed drafts
of such Tax Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing
thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Buyers review and approval,
which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller and
Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such
Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that Seller and
Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return prior
to the due date for filing, such Tax Return shall be filed by Seller without
Buyers consent, and the dispute regarding such Tax Return shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 15.13, which resolution shall be binding on the Parties.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to the Assets or production of
Hydrocarbons from the Assets after the Closing Date for (i) taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any taxable period that
includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of Seller, to the extent
permitted by Law and in a manner consistent with the allocation described in
Section 2.4(a) and the Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. Buyer shall
provide Seller with copies of completed drafts of such Tax Returns at least
ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with supporting
workpapers, for Sellers review and approval. Buyer and Seller shall attempt
in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to
the due date for filing. If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return prior to the due date for filing, such Tax Return
shall be filed by Buyer without Sellers consent and the dispute regarding
such Tax Return shall be resolved pursuant to Section 15.13, which resolution
shall be binding on the Parties. Buyer shall provide Seller, as applicable,
and their representatives with reasonable access to the employees, tax
preparers and records of Buyer for purposes of review of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(c) If notice of any action, suit, investigation or audit is received by Buyer
with respect to Taxes for which Seller may reasonably be expected to be liable
under this Agreement or applicable Law (a " ** _Tax Claim_** "), Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller in writing of such Tax Claim.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of Seller in
defending, settling, compromising, admitting, or acknowledging any Tax Claim;
provided, that Buyer shall keep Seller fully and currently apprised of
developments relating to such Tax Claim, and Buyer shall not settle such Tax
Claim without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, further, that at the
election of Seller, Buyer and Seller shall jointly control (at each Partys
own expense) any defense, settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment
of any Tax Claim, in which event no Tax Claim shall be settled or compromised
without the prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of each of Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall be entitled
to assume sole control over the defense, settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of any Tax Claim provided that Buyer first releases any claim
hereunder and releases Seller from all obligations under with respect to such
Tax Claim.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall not file an amended Tax Return with respect to any period or
partial period ended on or before the Closing Date if such amendment would
have, or would reasonably be expected to have, an adverse affect on Seller
under this Agreement or under applicable Law without the prior written consent
of Seller.

 



 

(f) Any refund of a Tax for a period prior to the Effective Time or of a Tax
apportioned to Seller pursuant to Article 9 shall be for the account of
Seller, and if such a refund is obtained or credited to Buyer, Buyer shall
promptly pay over to Seller such amount obtained or credited.

 



 

ARTICLE 14. 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

14.1. _Buyer s Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations_. Without affecting
Buyers rights under Articles 4 and 5 with respect to remedies for Title
Defects and Environmental Defects, upon Closing, Buyer shall assume and pay,
perform, fulfill and discharge all of the following claims, costs, expenses,
liabilities and obligations (collectively, the " ** _Obligations_** ")
accruing or relating to the (a) ownership, use or operation of the Assets
after the Effective Time including owning, developing, exploring, operating or
maintaining the Assets or the producing, transporting and marketing of
Hydrocarbons from the Assets, the payment of Property Expenses, the make-up
and balancing obligations for overproduction of gas from the Wells, and all
liability for royalty and overriding royalty payments and Production Taxes
(allocated in accordance with Article 9) made with respect to the Assets; and
(b) the Environmental Liabilities ((a) and (b), collectively, the " **
_Assumed Liabilities_** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Assumed
Liabilities shall not include any of the following: (a) the payment or
improper payment by Seller of royalties accruing under the Leases prior to the
Effective Time with respect to Assets that Seller serves as the operator; (b)
any obligations, duties and liabilities that (i) do not primarily relate to or
primarily arise out of, the Assets (other than liability for costs and
expenses allocated to Buyer under other provisions of this Agreement), (ii)
that are attributable to periods prior to or after the Effective Time that
relate to Sellers corporate overhead (including personnel) other than
liability for costs and expenses allocated to Buyer under other provisions of
this Agreement or (iii) relate to any pre-Effective Time Property Expenses
allocated to Seller under other provisions of this Agreement; (c) any
obligations, duties and liabilities of Seller primarily relating to or arising
from each of the Excluded Assets; (d) any obligations, duties and liabilities
relating to the matters set forth on **_Schedule 6.5_** ; and (e) any income
taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates, which shall be retained by Seller
((a) through (e), collectively, the " ** _Retained Liabilities_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

14.2. _Indemnification_. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall indemnify
each other as follows:

 



 

(a) _Seller s Indemnification_. Seller shall defend, indemnify, and save and
hold harmless Buyer, its members, managers, shareholders, officers, directors,
employees and agents (the " ** _Buyer Indemnified Parties_** "), from and
against all Losses which arise directly or indirectly from or in connection
with (i) the Retained Liabilities, (ii) any breach by Seller of any of
Sellers representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that
survive the Closing or (iii) any breach of Sellers covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Buyer s Indemnification_. Buyer shall defend, indemnify, and save and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective members,
managers, shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and
against all Losses which arise directly or indirectly from or in connection
with (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of Buyers
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any
breach of Buyers covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Limitations on Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, Seller shall have no liability for indemnification hereunder or
for any Losses pursuant to Section 14.2(a) until the total of all Losses with
respect to such matters exceed $9,900,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** "), after
which point the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
only in excess of the Deductible. The aggregate liability of Seller for
indemnification pursuant to Section 14.2(a) with respect to Losses suffered by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not exceed $49,500,000 (the " ** _Cap_**
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible and the Cap will not apply
to a breach of the Fundamental Representations or to Sellers obligation to
indemnify Buyer for the Retained Liabilities.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, Sellers and Buyers sole and exclusive remedy against each
other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 6, 7 and 8, and the
affirmations of such representations and warranties, covenants, and agreements
contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Section 12.3(b), is set forth in this Section 14.2, and if no such right of
indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims are hereby waived to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. Except for the remedies contained in this
Section 14.2, and any other remedies available to the Parties at law or in
equity for breaches of this Agreement other than Articles 6, 7 and 8, upon
Closing, each Party releases, remises, and forever discharges the other Party
from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
damages, Losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of action whatsoever,
in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might now or
subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising out of this Agreement
or Sellers ownership, use, or operation of the Assets, or the condition,
quality, status, or nature of the Assets, **INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION
OR COST RECOVERY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION
AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON
LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS UNDER INSURANCE**

 



      
 

 



 

 **POLICIES ISSUED OR UNDERWRITTEN BY THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON, INVITEE OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A
PREEXISTING CONDITION.**

 



 

(e) **EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH
PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT
TO THE OTHER PARTY S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.**

 



 

14.3. _Procedure_. The indemnifications contained in Section 14.2 shall be
implemented as follows:

 



 

(a) _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (" ** _Indemnified Party_** ") shall submit a written " ** _Claim
Notice_** " to the other Party (" ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") which, to be
effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the Survival Period
applicable under Section 14.4 to the representation or warranty that is the
subject of such Claim Notice and must state: (i) the amount of each payment
claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing, (ii) the basis for such claim,
with supporting documentation, and (iii) a list identifying to the extent
reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for which payment is so
claimed. Unless, within sixty days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that it
contests the Losses identified in such Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall, subject to the other terms of this Section 14.3, pay to the Indemnified
Party the amount of the Losses related to such indemnification claim or the
uncontested portion thereof. If the Indemnifying Party objects to a Claim
Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall promptly
request from the Indemnified Party any specific additional information
reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall provide the additional information reasonably
requested. Upon receipt of such additional information, the Indemnifying Party
shall notify the Indemnified Party of any withdrawal or modification of the
objection. All disputed indemnification claims shall be resolved by Buyer and
Seller in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Buyer and
Seller, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) final arbitration in
accordance with Section 15.13.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a
claim or legal action by a third party that may result in a Loss for which
indemnification may be sought under this Article 14 (a " ** _Claim_** "), the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified
Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and
other information with respect to such Claim. At the election of the
Indemnifying Party made within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice,
the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of
such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter
relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the
determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, and

 



      
 

 



 

the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys
choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can result in any liability
or cost to the Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to be indemnified
hereunder without its consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
control, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for
investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information
and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem
necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter.
In the absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will use its best
efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, any claim, legal
action or other matter to which such other Partys indemnification under this
Article 14 applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if
the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense with the Indemnifying Partys
consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If such a Claim requires
immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize
defense of such Claim or either Partys position with respect to such Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any
such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable attorneys fees of the Indemnified Party if the
Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that
there is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of
attorneys and one local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties
subject to such Claim).

 



 

14.4. _Survival of Warranties, Representations and Covenants_. All
representations and warranties contained in Articles 6 and 7 of this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until 5:00 p.m.,
Denver, Colorado time, on the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing
Date, at which time they shall terminate, except that those representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1 (Status), 6.2 (Power), 6.3
(Authorization and Enforceability) and Section 6.4 (Brokers Fees) made by
Seller, and Sections 7.1 (Organization and Standing), 7.2 (Power) and 7.3
(Authorization and Enforceability) made by Buyer (the " ** _Fundamental
Representations_** "), will survive indefinitely (the applicable period, being
referred to herein as the **_"Survival Period_** "). The covenants and
performance obligations contained in this Agreement that contemplate
performance after the Closing shall survive the Closing and shall continue
until all obligations with respect thereto shall have been performed or
satisfied or shall have been terminated in accordance with their terms.

 



 

14.5. _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing herein is intended to limit or
otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any non-party
for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the
Assets.

 



 

14.6. _Reductions in Losses_. The amount of any Losses for which an
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 14 shall be
reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person
or its Affiliates with respect to such Losses (net of any collection costs,
and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten

 



      
 

 



 

by the Indemnified Person or its insurance captive or other Affiliate), and by
the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by Buyer as a result of
the events giving rise to the Losses in question.

 



 

14.7. _Waiver by Buyer_. Seller shall not have any obligation or liability
under this Agreement or in connection with or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for any breach, misrepresentation, or
noncompliance with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant,
indemnity, or obligation if such breach, misrepresentation, or noncompliance
shall have been waived by Buyer.

will not, and will not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or

otherwise, against the Debt Providers in any way relating to this Agreement or

assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement is

delivered by the Parties.

 



 

15.11. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Other than as set forth in this Section
15.11 and in Section 15.15, this Agreement is intended only to benefit the

claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except that the Debt
Providers and their respective current, former or future directors, officers,
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling
persons, Affiliates, employees or

arising from a breach of this Section 15.12.

 



 

15.13. _Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_. All Disputes (other than a
Partys right to seek specific performance which may be brought in any court
of competent jurisdiction and as to which this Section 15.13 shall not apply)
between the Parties related to this Agreement shall be resolved by
arbitration, pursuant to the following procedures:

 



 

(a) The parties to any arbitration pursuant to this Section 15.13 shall select
an arbitrator or arbitrators as follows:

 



 

(1) For arbitration of a Dispute as described in Section 4.3 with respect to
Title Disputed Matter or arbitration of a Dispute as described in Section 5.4
with respect to Environmental Defects, the parties to such arbitration shall
select a single, independent arbitrator within ten (10) days after written
demand for such arbitration by any Party. If the parties to such arbitration
are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator, then such arbitration shall be
conducted with three (3) arbitrators, selected pursuant to Section
15.13(a)(2); provided, however, any such arbitrators selected pursuant to
Section 15.13(a)(2) must comply with the applicable qualifications enumerated
in the last two sentences in this Section 15.13(a)(1). For Disputes involving
Title Disputed Matters pursuant to Section 4.3, any arbitrator selected shall
be qualified by education, knowledge and experience with title defects
affecting the types of properties which are subject to the disputed Title
Defect and have a minimum of ten years experience with such types of defects
and properties. For Disputes concerning Environmental Defects, the arbitrator
selected shall be qualified by education, knowledge and experience with
environmental defects affecting the types of properties which are subject to
the disputed Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Amount and have a
minimum of ten years experience with such types of defects and properties.

 



 

(2) For arbitration of any other Dispute, each side to such arbitration shall
each select a single, independent arbitrator within ten (10) days after
written demand for such arbitration by any Party. The two (2) arbitrators
selected by the respective sides shall, in turn, select the third neutral and
independent arbitrator. For any Dispute concerning Section 9.4 (with respect
to the preparation of Tax Returns and the payment of Taxes), each of the three
(3) arbitrators shall be a tax accountant with a minimum of ten years
experience with the types of Taxes in question.

 



 

(b) The arbitration shall be governed by Colorado Law but the specific
procedure to be followed shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). It is the
intent of the Parties that the arbitration be conducted as efficiently and
inexpensively as possible, with only limited discovery as determined by the
arbitrator without regard to the discovery permitted under the Colorado or
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in the City and County of Denver,
Colorado, and a hearing shall be held no later than sixty (60) days after
submission of the matter to arbitration, and a written decision shall be
rendered by the arbitrators within thirty (30) days of the hearing.

 



 

(d) At the hearing, the Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as
they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal rules of
evidence shall not be required but the arbitrator shall consider any evidence
and testimony that he or she determines to be relevant, in accordance with
procedures that it determines to be appropriate.

 



 

(e) Any award entered in the arbitration shall be made by a written opinion
stating the reasons and basis for the award made.

 



 

(f) The costs incurred in employing the arbitrators, including the
arbitrators retention of any independent qualified experts, shall be borne
50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer.

 



 

(g) The arbitrators award may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction
and may be enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such court.

 



 

15.14. _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement, and
the Parties agree to work in good faith toward closing the transaction on or
before the Closing Date. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving
any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking
such action (and the expiration date of such period during that notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business
Day.

 



 

15.15. _Certain Agreements with Respect to Debt Providers_. Seller agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives
(collectively, the " ** _Seller Related Parties_** ") that the Debt Providers
and their Affiliates, stockholders and representatives and each of their
successors and assigns (i) shall be subject to no liability or claims by the
Seller Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the
Debt Financing, or the performance of services by such Debt Providers or their
Affiliates or representatives with respect to the foregoing and (ii) are
express third party beneficiaries of this Section 15.15, (which may not be
changed as to any type of Debt Financing without its prior written consent)
and Section 11.2, Sections 14.2(d) and (e), Section 15.8, Section 15.11 and
Section 15.13.

 



 

15.16. _Parent Assurances and Representations_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause Buyer to comply in full and promptly with any specific
performance order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that requires
Buyer to close the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms set forth
herein. Parent waives all defenses and rights of subrogation with respect to
its unconditional assurance in this Section 15.16(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Representations and Warranties of Parent_.

 



 

(1) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Yukon Territory.

 



 

(2) Parent has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
presently conducted. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
fulfillment of and compliance with the terms and conditions hereof (including
the guarantee contemplated by this Section 15.16) will not, as of the Closing,
violate or conflict with, any material provision of Parents governing
documents, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any judgment, decree, order,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent.

 



 

(3) Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller, this
Agreement constitutes Parents legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable
in accordance with its terms, subject, however, to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws for the protection of
creditors, as well as to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
