Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ") acting as
trustee, and such monies are invested in "government securities" (as such
term is defined in the Investment Company Act) and held in trust by the
Trustee pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement. The Investment
Management Trust Agreement is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Buyer and to the knowledge of Buyer, the Trustee,
enforceable against it and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the Trustee in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exception. The Investment
Management Trust Agreement has not been terminated, repudiated, rescinded,
amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such termination,
repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated by Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, the Trustee. There are no
separate Contracts that would cause the description of the Investment
Management Trust Agreement in the Buyer SEC Documents to be inaccurate in
any material respect or, to the knowledge of Buyer, that would entitle any
Person (other than (a) the holders of Securities of the Buyer prior to the
Closing Date who shall have elected to redeem their Buyer Class A Common Stock
pursuant to Buyer's Organizational Documents or (b) if Buyer fails to
complete a " _Business Combination_ ", as such term is defined in

liquidates the Trust Fund, subject to the terms of the Investment Management
Trust Agreement, Buyer in limited amounts to permit Buyer to pay the expenses
of the Trust Account's liquidation and dissolution, and then Buyer's public
shareholders) to any portion of the funds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account are required to be
released, except to pay Taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust
Account, and to redeem Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Buyer's Organizational
Documents. Since October 31, 2020, Buyer has not released any money from the
Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the principal held in the
Trust Account as permitted by the Investment Management Trust Agreement or
reimbursements for tax liability of Buyer arising from interest income earned
on the principal held in the Trust Account as permitted by the Investment
Management Trust Agreement). As of the Closing, the obligations of the Buyer
to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the Buyer's Organizational Documents
shall terminate, and, as of the Closing, Buyer shall have no obligation
whatsoever pursuant to the Buyer's Organizational Documents to dissolve and
liquidate the assets of Buyer by reason of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, there are

Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
foregoing, if on the date for which Buyer Special Meeting is scheduled, Buyer
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain
the Required Buyer Stockholder Approval (as defined below), whether or not a

and, together with the Buyer DandO Indemnified Persons, the " _D andO Indemnified
Persons_") as provided in their respective Organizational Documents, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or under any
indemnification, employment or other similar agreements (including the
advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law) between any DandO Indemnified Person and any of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or Buyer (as applicable) in effect on the Effective Date and

respective Affiliates), at the sole cost and expense of such Existing
Equityholder (or their respective Affiliates), shall be responsible for
filing all of the Tax Returns required to be filed by such Existing
Equityholders (or such Existing Equityholder's respective Affiliates) under
applicable Tax Law and timely paying all of the Taxes due and owing by such

other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to _Section 7.11(a)_ and any examination or other Tax Action with

other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection
with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.11(c)_

Contribution Amount by Buyer to the Company governed by Section 721(a) of the
Code (and any similar applicable state or local provisions of Tax Law) and
(ii) the recapitalization of the equity interests of the Company in
connection with the execution of the AandR Operating Agreement will be treated
as a non-taxable recapitalization of the equity of the Company (clauses (i)
and (ii), the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The parties shall, and shall
cause each of their respective applicable Affiliates to prepare and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment; take no position in
any communication (whether written or unwritten) with any Taxing Authority or
any other action inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment (unless
otherwise required by applicable Law or a determination by a Taxing
Authority); promptly inform each other of any challenge by any Taxing

with applicable Laws. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall have the right
to participate, at its sole cost and expense, in any Tax Action of any member
of the Company Group that is a Flow-Thru Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or Straddle Period), and no such Tax Action shall be settled or
compromised without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent the
settlement or compromise of any such Tax Action would reasonably be expected
to result in any imputed underpayment imposed pursuant to Section 6232 of the
Code on any member of the Company Group and for which no election under
Section 6226 of the Code is available.

amendment or supplement to the Extension Proxy Statement so that it would not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company or the
Buyer (as applicable) shall promptly inform Buyer or the Company (as
applicable) and each cooperate with the other in filing with the SEC or
mailing to Buyer's stockholders an amendment or supplement to the Extension
Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Buyer shall use its commercially

stockholders (the " _Buyer Extension Meeting_ ") in accordance with the
Buyer's Organizational Documents and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(b), for a date
no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Extension Approval End Date

the extent (1) the Required Buyer Stockholder Approval is obtained at any
time before the Buyer Extension Meeting is held and (2) the Closing has
occurred prior to the Extension Approval End Date, all obligations under this
_Section 7.15_ , shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. Buyer
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the
approval of the Extension Proposals, and include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement. The Buyer Board shall not withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify its recommendation to the stockholders of Buyer that they vote in
favor of the Extension Proposals.

  



  

   

72

establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Buyer Extension Meeting and submit for approval the Extension Proposals and
(y) Buyer agrees that if the Buyer Extension Approval shall not have been
obtained at any such Buyer Extension Meeting, then Buyer shall promptly
continue to take all such necessary actions, including the actions required
by this _Section 7.15_ , and hold additional Buyer Extension Meetings
in order to obtain the Buyer Extension Approval. Buyer may only adjourn the
Buyer Extension Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Buyer Extension Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum,

supplemental or amended disclosure that Buyer has determined in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel is required under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by stockholders of Buyer prior to the Buyer Extension Meeting or (iv)
with the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in the event that, as a result of the Buyer
Stock Redemptions submitted by the Buyer's stockholders prior to the Buyer
Extension Meeting, the conditions set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_ would not be
satisfied as of the Closing; _provided_ , that the Buyer Extension Meeting (A)
may not be adjourned to a date that is more than twenty (20) days after the
date for which the Buyer Extension Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding
any adjournments required by applicable Law) and (B) is held no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Extension Approval End Date.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure by such party (in the case of the

incapable of being cured by the Outside Closing Date, or if capable of being
cured by the Outside Closing Date, shall not be cured within twenty (20) days

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if at such time
Buyer is in material breach of this Agreement which would result in a failure
to satisfy any condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_.

  



  

(e) The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to Buyer if
Buyer shall have materially breached any of its covenants,
agreements, representations, and warranties contained herein to be performed
at or prior to the Closing and such breach (i) would result in the failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ and

of being cured by the Outside Closing Date, shall not be cured within twenty
(20) days following receipt by Buyer of a notice describing in reasonable
detail the nature of such breach; _provided_ , that the Company shall not

76

adjournment or recess thereof).

termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the part of any
party, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their and their
Affiliates' respective Representatives, and all rights and obligations of
each party shall cease, except that the provisions of _Article I_, this
_Article IX_, _Article X_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 9.2_
shall be deemed to release any party from any Liability for Fraud prior to
such termination.

apply only in the particular instance in which such waiver shall have been
given.

or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to

or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not
otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other
right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect

any other breach.

  



  

   

78

Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the

interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made based
upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

liability of, any Existing Equityholder.

  



  

10.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal Authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal Authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

10.13 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final IPO prospectus
of Buyer, dated September 10, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company Group
and the Existing Equityholders understand that Buyer has established the Trust
Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of Buyer and the
underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement
and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in
the Trust Account, Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for
the purposes set forth in the Investment Management Trust Agreement. For and
in consideration of Buyer agreeing to enter into this Agreement, the Company
Group and the Existing Equityholders each hereby agree that he, she or it does
not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that he, she or it will not
seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit the Company Group's or the Existing Equityholders'
right to pursue a claim against Buyer for legal relief against monies or
other assets that are held outside the Trust Account and other than
distributions from the Trust Account directly or indirectly to the Buyer's
stockholders, for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so
long as such claim would not affect Buyer's ability to fulfill its obligations
to effectuate the redemptions of the Buyer Units or Buyer Common Stock or
comply with the Investment Management Trust Agreement or
Buyer's Organizational Documents and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit
or prohibit any claims that the Company Group and the Existing Equityholders
may have in the future against Buyer's assets or funds that are not held in
the Trust Account and other than distributions from the Trust Account
directly or indirectly to Buyer's public stockholders.

  



  

   

82

 

    



  

10.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that no
recourse under this Agreement or under any Additional Agreements shall be had
against any Person that is not a party to this Agreement or such Additional
Agreement, as applicable, including any past, present or future director,
officer, agent, employee or other Representative of any past, present or
future equity holder of any Existing Equityholder or of any Affiliate or
successor or assignee thereof (collectively, the " _Non-Recourse Parties_
"), as such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any
Non-Recourse Party in connection with or arising out of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or the Additional
Agreements to the contrary, the obligations of the Existing Equityholders
hereunder and thereunder are several.

  



  

10.15 _General Release_.

  



  

(a) Each Existing Equityholder, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates (individually, a " _Company Releasor_ " and collectively, "
_Company Releasors_ ") hereby releases and forever discharges the Company
Group, and any past present and future Affiliates or Representatives of the
Company Group (individually, a " _Company Releasee_ " or collectively, "
_Company Releasees_ ") from any and all Actions, Orders, Contracts and
Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
both at law and in equity, which each Company Releasor or any of their
respective Affiliates, Representatives or any of its or their respective
heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, now has, has ever had, or may
hereafter have against any Company Releasee arising contemporaneously with or
prior to the Closing Date solely from the Company Releasor's capacity as a
holder of the Existing Company Units and not in such Existing Equityholder's
capacity as an employee, director, manager, contractual counterparty (other
than as a holder of the Existing Company Units) or any other capacity other
than as a holder of Existing Company Incentive Units (all of the foregoing
collectively, the " _Company Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall operate to release any obligations of the
Company Group under this Agreement or the Additional Agreements between the
Company and any Existing Equityholder. Each Company Releasor hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
Company Released Claim, or commencing, instituting, or causing to be
commenced, any Action of any kind against any Company Releasee based upon any
matter released hereby.

  



  

(b) Sponsor, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates (individually, a
" _Sponsor Releasor_ " and collectively, " _Sponsor Releasors_ ") hereby
releases and forever discharges Buyer and, following the Closing, PubCo and
the Company Group, and any past present and future Affiliates or
Representatives of the Buyer and, following the Closing, PubCo and Company
Group (individually, a " _Sponsor Releasee_ " or collectively, " _Sponsor
Releasees_ ") from any and all Actions, Orders, Contracts and Liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law
and in equity, which each Sponsor Releasor or any of their respective
Affiliates, Representatives or any of its or their respective heirs,
executors, administrators or assigns, now has, or will have ever had as of the
Closing, against any Sponsor Releasee arising contemporaneously with or prior
to the Closing Date from the Sponsor Releasor's capacity as a holder of Buyer
Common Stock (all of the foregoing collectively, the " _Sponsor Released
Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
operate to release any obligations of Buyer, PubCo or the Company under this
Agreement or the Additional Agreements between Sponsor and Buyer. Each
Sponsor Releasor hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any Sponsor Released Claim, or commencing, instituting,
or causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind against any Sponsor
Releasee based upon any matter released hereby.

  



  

   

83

 

    



  

(c) Company Releasees and Sponsor Releasees are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.15_.

  



  

10.16 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

each case, whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the
meaning, effect, validity, termination, interpretation, performance, or
enforcement of this Agreement), the negotiation, execution performance or any
alleged breach thereof (" _Related Claim_ ") to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware (and any
courts having jurisdiction over appeals therefrom), or, if no federal court in
the State of Delaware accepts jurisdiction, any state court within the State
of Delaware (and any courts having jurisdiction over appeals
therefrom) (collectively, the " _Specified Courts_ ")), and the parties
hereby irrevocably agree that all Related Claims shall be heard and determined
in such courts. The parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive personal and
subject matter jurisdiction of any Specified Court any Related Claims and (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Related Claim brought in any Specified Court or
any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. The
parties agree that a final judgment in any such dispute shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law.

  



  

(b) The parties hereby consent to process being served by any other party in
any Related Claim by the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 10.1_ (other than by email) along with a notification
that service of process is being served in conformance with this _Section
10.16(b)_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

(c) This submission to jurisdiction Section shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

10.17 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of

breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements
and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and
expire upon the occurrence of the Closing (and there shall be no liability

occurring at or after the Closing and (b) this  _Article X_.

  



  

   

84

specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any Action shall be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law, and each party
agrees to waiver any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection therewith.

herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of
this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure
made by a party in the Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of

disclosure in such Schedule. Certain information set forth in the Schedules
is included solely for informational purposes.

by this Agreement. Each of Buyer and the Company on behalf of itself and the

relating thereto, even though the interests of the Buyer Post-Closing
Representation may be directly adverse to any Waiving Party.

decision or determination in its own capacity, and Buyer may rely upon such
action, exercise of right, power, or authority or such decision or
determination of the Existing Equityholder Representative as the action,
inaction, exercise, right, power, or authority, or decision or
determination of such Person, and no Existing Equityholder shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Buyer is
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by the

accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Existing
Equityholder Representative.

  



  

(e) On the date hereof, each Existing Equityholder has provided to the
