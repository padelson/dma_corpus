AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 18, 2005 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among SKO Group Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), SKO Acquisition Corp., a Wisconsin corporation (" _Acquisition Sub_ "),
and ShopKo Stores, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the " _Company_ ")
(Acquisition Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the " _Constituent Corporations_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, on April 7, 2005, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger with Badger Retail Holding, Inc. and Badger Acquisition Corp. (such
agreement, as amended, the " _Badger Merger Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "),
based upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee thereof
consisting solely of disinterested directors (the " _Special Committee_ "),
has approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the
" _Merger_ "), has determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (a) constitute a Superior Proposal
(as such term is defined in the Badger Merger Agreement), and (b) are
advisable to, fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Company
Common Stock and has resolved (subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock vote for
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, based on such determination, the Company has terminated the Badger
Merger Agreement (as such term is defined in the Badger Merger Agreement);

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Acquisition Sub have
each approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, is approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, as the sole shareholder of Acquisition Sub.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 
 

 



 



 

Section 1.1

 

 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ "),
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective
Time and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall thereupon
cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.2

 

 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., local time, on the second Business Day after satisfaction or
waiver (subject to Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver (subject to Applicable Law)
of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing being referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10178, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 

Section 1.3

 

 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective at the close of business
on the date when articles of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Articles of
Merger_ "), in such form as required by and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the WBCL, are duly filed with the Department of
Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin, or at such other date and
time as the Constituent Corporations shall agree should be specified in the
Articles of Merger. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_
" means the later of the close of business on the date when the Articles of
Merger are duly filed or such later date and time established by the Articles
of Merger. The filing of the Articles of Merger shall be made as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Law) of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_.

 

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.1

 

 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 180.1106 of the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2

 

 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the articles of incorporation of Acquisition Sub,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law,
except that Article I thereof shall be amended to read as follows: "The name
of the Corporation is ShopKo Stores, Inc."

 

Section 2.3

 

 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, by
Applicable Law or the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
indemnification provisions consistent with the obligations set forth in
_Section 5.6(a)_.

 

Section 2.4

 

 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

Section 2.5

 

 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Acquisition
Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

Section 2.6

 

 _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock; Conversion of Common
Stock Owned by the Company\'s Subsidiaries_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, (i)
each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") that is held by the Company as a "treasury share"
(as defined in Section 180.0103 of the WBCL) shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or
delivered in exchange therefor, (ii) each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in
exchange therefor, and (iii) each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock owned by a Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ ").

 

Section 2.7

 

 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance
with _Section 2.6_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive $28.75 in
cash (which amount shall increase at the rate of 6% per annum during the
period commencing on October 26, 2005 through and including the Closing Date)
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer remain outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.10_ , without interest or
dividends.

 

Section 2.8

 

 _Conversion of the Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Acquisition Sub
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (to the extent such concepts are applicable, and except, if
applicable, as otherwise provided in Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL) share
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

Section 2.9

 

 _Option Consideration_. Each Company Stock Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be
canceled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a single lump
sum cash payment from the Surviving Corporation (less any applicable income or
employment Tax withholding) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that if the exercise price per share of any
such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. Prior to the Closing, the Company, in
consultation with Parent, shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions
reasonably necessary, including the amendment of the Company Stock Option
Plans, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary
consent of each holder of a Company Stock Option, to give effect to the
treatment of Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , to the
extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Option Plans and related award agreements.

 

Section 2.10

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective
Time, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company, shall be
designated by Parent to act as the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

(b)

 

 _Deposit with Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, separate and apart from its other
funds, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, other than such shares held by
Parent, Acquisition Sub, or any Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Holder_
"), cash in the amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration which
Holders are entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ , with
irrevocable instructions and authority to such Paying Agent to pay to each
respective Holder, as evidenced by a list of such Holders certified by an
officer of the Company or the Company\'s transfer agent, for each share of
Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration upon surrender of their
respective Certificates as provided herein. Except as provided in _Sections
2.10(c)_ , _2.10(d)_ and _2.10(e)_ , any such deposit of funds shall be
irrevocable.

 

(c)

 

 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the cash (pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ) to be received by the
holder thereof pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, to be mailed
within three (3) Business Days of receipt thereof, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. If Certificates are
presented to the Company for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall
be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration. All cash paid upon
conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(d)

 

 _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ and any
interest received with respect thereto (the " _Merger Fund_ ") that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine (9) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon, and in accordance with, any
demand by Parent therefor, and any holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this _Section 2.10_ shall thereafter look, as
general creditors thereof, only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to such Certificates. 

 

(e)

 

 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
any of their respective Affiliates or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash held in the Merger Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any cash in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f)

 

 _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included
in the Merger Fund as directed by Parent; ___provided_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent;
_provided_ , that any such investment or any such payment of interest or other
income may not delay the receipt by Holders of any Merger Consideration. If
for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Merger Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the
Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Merger
Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

 

(g)

 

 _Transfer Taxes_. If any cash is to be remitted to a Person (other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered), it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(h)

 

 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provisions of applicable state, local or foreign
Tax law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ shall be subject to reduction for all
applicable Tax withholdings and other withholdings required by Applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent.

 

(i)

 

 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except (i) as set forth in the corresponding section of the Company Disclosure
Letter, it being understood that matters disclosed pursuant to one section of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any
other section of the Company Disclosure Letter where it is reasonably apparent
that the matters so disclosed are applicable to such other sections, or (ii)
solely with respect to actions taken after the date of this Agreement,
expressly required under this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and to Acquisition Sub as
follows:

 

Section 3.1

 

 _Organization_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
their respective organization and have the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate their respective properties and to carry on their
respective businesses as now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are duly qualified or licensed to do business and are in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of their respective
businesses or the ownership, leasing or operation of their respective
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where
the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent and Acquisition Sub true and complete copies of its articles of
incorporation (the " _Company Articles_ ") and by-laws (the " _Company Bylaws_
") and the charter and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of
its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case as currently in effect. 

 

Section 3.2

 

 _Authorization_. 

 

(a)

 

The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and (subject to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval), to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action (subject to
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company, and constitutes, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to
or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

 

(b)

 

The Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous

now being conducted and in the manner described in the Company SEC Documents
(the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) would not reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the performance of this Agreement
by the Company or materially impair the ability of the Company to take any
action necessary to consummate the Merger. All such Company Permits are
valid, and in full force and effect, and no suspension or cancellation of any
of the Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except for such failures to be valid or in full force and effect
or for such suspensions or cancellations that, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (y) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the performance of this Agreement by the Company or

and clear of all Liens created by the Company and its Subsidiaries, all
Intellectual Property Rights necessary, or used or held for use in connection
with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

Rights of any Third Party, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there has
been no such claim asserted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
since February 2, 2002, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except

Section 3.15

 

 _Material Contracts_. 

 

(a)

 

Except as filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any Contract (i) that is a "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC),
(ii) with any of the twenty largest merchandise suppliers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured by dollar volume of purchases by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Companys fiscal year ended January
29, 2005), (iii) with any Person (other than any merchandise supplier of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) that involves annual expenditures in excess of
$2,000,000 and is not cancelable within 180 days without financial penalty to
the Company, (iv) that provides for the indemnification by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of any Person (except for indemnification provided for in
standard vendor supply contracts or real property leases, entered into in the
ordinary course of business), (v) that relates to any joint venture or
partnership in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns an interest,
(vi) that restricts or limits the conduct of any line of business by the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of the Company\'s current or
future Affiliates or the geographic area in which the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company or any of the Company\'s current or future Affiliates may
conduct business, except for such limitations or restrictions that are
customary for such Contracts and that only restrict the operation of
individual stores, in each case in any material respect, or (vii) that grants
any right of first refusal, right of first offer, option or similar right with
respect to, or limits or purports to limit the ability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of, any
Company Real Property or any portion thereof or any other material amount of
assets or business. Each Contract of the type described in the first sentence
of this _Section 3.15(a)_ is referred to herein as a " _Company Material
Contract_." 

 

(b)

 

Each Company Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the
Company (or, if a Subsidiary of the Company is a party, such Subsidiary) and
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for any such
Company Material Contracts that have expired subsequent to the date of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no Third Party is, in
default under any Company Material Contract, nor does any condition exist
which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a
violation of or default under any Company Material Contract by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, such Third Party,
except for defaults that (i) have not had, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
performance of this Agreement by the Company or materially impair the ability
of the Company to take any action necessary to consummate the Merger. No
counterparty to any Company Material Contract has cancelled or otherwise
terminated any Company Material Contract or provided to the Company written
notice or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice of its intent to do
so.

or covering the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to their respective
businesses, assets and properties, including comprehensive general liability,
fire and casualty, automobile liability, and workers\' compensation insurance
(the " _Insurance Policies_ "). The Insurance Policies are in full force and
effect, and no written notice of cancellation has been received by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such Insurance Policy which has
not been cured by the payment of premiums that are due, other than as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received notice of any
threatened termination of, material premium increase with respect to, or
material alteration of coverage under, any Insurance Policy. The insurance
coverage provided by the Insurance Policies (including as to deductibles and
self-insured retentions and as to risks and losses covered) is reasonable and
customary as compared to similarly situated companies engaged in a similar
business. There are no pending material claims under the Insurance Policies
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as to which the insurers have denied
liability.

 

 _Section 3.17_

 

 _Real Estate; Assets_. 

 

(a)

complete list of each parcel of real property owned in fee by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Fee Property_ "), which list includes
the legal address, record owner and the use thereof (i.e., ShopKo, Pamida or
other use). The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good, valid and
marketable title to each Company Fee Property. The Company Fee Property is
not subject to any Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances. Prior to the
date hereof, the Company has made available to Parent correct and complete
copies of all deeds, mortgages, surveys, Company Permits relating to the
Company Fee Property, title insurance commitments or policies (including any
underlying documents relating to Permitted Encumbrances), if any, certificates

occupancy or operation of the Company Real Property to the extent the same are
in its possession or control.

 

(b)

 

 _Section 3.17(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of (i) all real property leased, subleased, licensed or
otherwise used or occupied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Company Leased Property_ " and together with the Company Fee Property, the "
_Company Real Property_ "), which list includes the legal address and the use
thereof (i.e., ShopKo, Pamida or other use) and (ii) each lease, sublease,
license or other agreement granting to any Third Party a right to the use,
occupancy or enjoyment of any Company Real Property or any portion thereof
(the " _Company Subleases_ "). The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has a
good and valid leasehold or other interest in the Company Leased Property,
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Company
has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of all leases,
subleases, licenses and other agreements (including all amendments,
modifications, supplements, and extensions thereof) granting rights of use,
occupancy or enjoyment to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Company Leased Property (the " _Company Leases_ " and together
with the Company Subleases, the " _Leases_ ") and copies of all Company
Subleases (including all amendments, modifications, supplements, and
extensions thereof). 

 

(c)

 

Each Lease is a valid and binding obligation of the Company (or, if a
Subsidiary of the Company is a party, such Subsidiary) and is in full force
and effect, except for any such Leases that expire subsequent to the date of
this Agreement in accordance with their terms or where the failure to be in
full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any Lease nor does any
condition exist that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, would
cause such a default under such Lease, except for defaults that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of any cancellation or termination of any Lease,
except for any such cancellation or termination that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated under,
or a party to, any Contract to purchase any Company Leased Property. 

 

(d)

 

(i) No condemnation proceeding is pending or threatened with respect to any
Company Real Property and (ii) the Company (and its applicable Subsidiary) and
the Company Real Property is in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and provisions of any restrictive covenants, easements, or agreements
affecting the same, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e)

 

All components of all material improvements (other than those which a Third
Party is contractually obligated to maintain) included within the Company Real
Property, including the roofs and structural elements thereof and the heating,
ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, sewer, waste
water, storm water, paving and parking equipment, systems and facilities
included therein, are in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and
adequate for the use and operation of the Company Real Property (subject, in
the case of Company Leased Property, for the remainder of the term of the
corresponding Lease) to which they relate in the conduct of the business as
presently conducted, except, in each case, for any such failure that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(f)

 

The Company Real Property (i) is served by all utilities required for the
current use thereof, including water, electrical supply, storm and sanitary
sewerage facilities, (ii) has access to public roads and streets necessary for
service of, and access to, such Company Real Property for the current use
thereof (publicly dedicated streets or a validly existing easement) and the
same are physically and legally open for use by the public and (iii) is free
from damage caused by fire or other casualty, which damage has not previously
been restored, except, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), for any
such failure that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 _Labor and Employment_. 

 

(a)

 

There are no labor agreements, collective bargaining agreements, work rules or
practices, or any other labor-related agreements or arrangements with any
labor union, labor organization, trade union or works council to which the

Subsidiaries has received notice of any complaint, lawsuit or other proceeding
pending or threatened in any forum by or on behalf of any present or former
employee of such entities, any applicant for employment, or classes of the
foregoing, alleging breach of any express or implied contract of employment,
any Applicable Law governing the employment relationship or the termination
thereof, except for such exceptions to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii)
which, individually or in the aggregate, (x) would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
performance of this Agreement by the Company or materially impair the ability
of the Company to take any action necessary to consummate the Merger.

 

(c)

 

The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Applicable Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of

Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of the intent of any Governmental
Entity responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct
an investigation with respect to or relating to employees and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such investigation is in progress, in each case,
which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (each, an " _Acquiror Entity_ ") hereby
jointly and severally represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1

 

 _Organization_. Each Acquiror Entity is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Entity Material Adverse Effect. Each Acquiror Entity is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Entity Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.2

 

 _Authorization_. Each Acquiror Entity has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly authorized, and this
Agreement has been approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of each
Acquiror Entity, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either
Acquiror Entity are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Acquisition Sub, is approving
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Acquiror Entity
and constitutes, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this

Entity, enforceable against each Acquiror Entity in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

Section 4.3

 

 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have
been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired,
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by each
Acquiror Entity nor the consummation by the Acquiror Entities of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or the similar
organizational documents of either Acquiror Entity, (ii) result in a violation
or breach of or loss of any benefit under, constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a change of control or default under, require
the consent or approval of or the giving of notice to a Third Party pursuant
to, or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration or impose on either of the Acquiror Entities any
obligation to repurchase, repay, redeem or acquire or any similar right or
obligation under, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of any Acquiror Entity, pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract to which any Acquiror Entity is a party or by which any of
them or any of their assets is bound or (iii) conflict with or violate any
Applicable Law applicable to any Acquiror Entity or by which any property or
asset of any Acquiror Entity is bound or affected, except for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which,
individually or in the aggregate, (1) with respect to clause (ii), would not
reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Entity Material Adverse Effect and
(2) with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), would not reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the performance of this Agreement by any
Acquiror Entity or materially impair the ability of any Acquiror Entity to
take any action necessary to consummate the Merger.

 

(b)

 

Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Acquiror Entities nor the consummation by the Acquiror Entities of the
transactions contemplated hereby will require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with, or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act,
any applicable Blue Sky Law and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (ii)
under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust and competition laws,
(iii) the filing and recordation of the Articles of Merger as required by the
WBCL and (iv) for such other consents, approvals, authorizations, permits,
filings or notifications, the failure of which to make or obtain, individually
or in the aggregate, (x) would not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror
Entity Material Adverse Effect or (y) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the performance of this Agreement by any Acquiror
Entity or materially impair the ability of any Acquiror Entity to take any
action necessary to consummate the Merger.

 

Section 4.4

 

 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Acquisition Sub consists
of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, all of which are
issued and outstanding and owned by Parent. Parent is indirectly controlled
by Sun Capital. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each Acquiror Entity have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (except, if applicable, as
otherwise provided in Section 180.0662(2)(b) of the WBCL) and are owned free
and clear of all Liens.

 

Section 4.5

 

 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information relating to the Acquiror Entities
and supplied or to be supplied by either Acquiror Entity or its respective
Affiliates specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (and any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto) will, as of the time of the mailing
of the Proxy Statement to the Company\'s shareholders, as of the time of the
Special Meeting and as of the time of any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation is made by any Acquiror Entity with respect
to statements made in any of the foregoing documents based upon information
supplied by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.6

 

 _Acquiror Entity\'s Operations_. Each Acquiror Entity was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and has not, other than in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby and other than those incidental to its organization and
maintenance of corporate existence, (i) engaged in any business activities,
(ii) conducted any operations, (iii) incurred any liabilities or (iv) owned
any assets or property. 

 

Section 4.7

 

 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Acquiror Entity nor any of its
respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as such terms are defined in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act) is the "beneficial owner" (as such term is defined
in the Company Articles) of any shares of Company Common Stock, except 600,240
shares owned by Elliott Associates, L.P. and 900,360 shares owned by Elliott
International, L.P.

 _Financing_. Parent and Acquisition Sub have previously delivered to the
Company fully executed commitment letters (each, a " _Financing Letter_ ")
from each of Sun Capital, Wachovia Bank, National Association, and Ableco
Finance LLC (each, a " _Financing Source_ ") and accepted by Parent, providing
the detailed terms and conditions upon which the Financing Sources have
committed to provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with debt and/or equity
financing in connection with the Merger in an aggregate amount equal to
$1,625,000,000. The financing contemplated by the Financing Letters (the "
_Financing_ "), together with the cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
are sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option
Consideration, any amounts due under the Credit Facility and any amounts due
in connection with the Debt Offer and pay all fees and expenses to be paid by
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
related to the transactions contemplated hereby (the sum total of the
foregoing amounts, the " _Required Cash Amount_ "). The Financing Letters are
in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The obligations to fund the
commitments under the Financing Letters are not subject to any condition other
than as set forth in the Financing Letters. Parent is not aware of any fact
or occurrence existing on the date of this Agreement that causes the Financing
Letters to be ineffective with respect to Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Merger, and Parent has no reason, as of the date hereof, to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters
within Parent\'s control will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not
be made available to Parent on the Closing Date.

 

Section 4.9

 

 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by either
Acquiror Entity or Sun Capital for which the Company would be liable if the
Merger were not consummated.

(a)

 

From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, (whether directly or indirectly through its Representatives), and the
Company shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its

or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a Company Alternative Transaction

Agreement. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, (a) the Company has received a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.4(a)_ and (b) the Special Committee has reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such
Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may take any of the actions described in clause
(ii) of this _Section 5.4(a)_ ; _provided_ , that the Company (A) will provide
notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub of the receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours after the Special Committee has
Knowledge of the receipt thereof, (B) will not disclose any information to

Agreement, the Company shall (whether directly or indirectly through its
Representatives), and the Company shall direct and use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential
information with respect thereto furnished by or on behalf of the Company be
returned or destroyed. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4(a)_ by
any of the Company\'s Representatives or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives,
whether or not purporting to act on behalf of the Company, shall constitute a
breach of this _Section 5.4(a)_ by the Company.

 

(b)

 

The Company shall, notify Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) of any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information or

the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and
the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall inform Parent on a current basis of the status and
terms of any discussions regarding, or relating to, any such Acquisition
Proposal with a Third Party (including amendments and proposed amendments)
and, as promptly as practicable, of any change in the price, structure or form
of the consideration or material terms of and conditions regarding the
Acquisition Proposal. In fulfilling its obligations under this _Section
5.4(b)_ , the Company shall provide promptly to Parent copies of all written
proposals. All information provided by the Company to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 5.4(b)_ shall be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Immediately upon determination by the
Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice (" _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Special Committee has so
determined, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the amount per share that the Company\'s shareholders will receive
per share of Company Common Stock (valuing any non-cash consideration at what
the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be the fair value of
the non-cash consideration)) and including a copy thereof with all
accompanying documentation and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and providing Parent with a copy of the Superior Proposal and all
documents relating thereto.

 

(c)

 

Each of the Special Committee (subject to approval and adoption by the Company
Board) and the Company Board (as applicable) has adopted a resolution
resolving (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) to recommend
that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock vote for the approval of
this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). Neither the Special
Committee nor the Company Board (as applicable) shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or make any statement,
filing or release, in connection with the Special Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking
a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be considered an adverse modification of the Company Recommendation),
subject to _Section 5.4(d)_ (any such action, a " _Change in Recommendation_
"), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Company Alternative Transaction and/or (iii) enter into (or cause the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into) any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related
to any Company Alternative Transaction (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 5.4(a))_ or (B) requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval, (x) the Company Board may effect a Change in
Recommendation if the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that it would be consistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under Applicable Law to effect
a Change in Recommendation (regardless of the existence of a Superior Proposal
at such time) and (y) (i) the Company Board may approve or recommend to the
shareholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal (a " _Company Subsequent
Determination_ "), (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_
and (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement related to such Superior Proposal if, but only
if, in each case with respect to clause (y), (A) the Company has fully
complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.4(c)_ , and (B) the
Company has complied with the terms of _Section 7.1(h)_ and has paid to Parent
the Expenses and the Termination Fee, in each case, in accordance with
_Section 7.3_.

 

(d)

 

Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company, the
Special Committee or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the
Company\'s shareholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer
by a Third Party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure required by Applicable Law or any
disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Special Committee, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, such disclosure is necessary in order for the Special
Committee to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders
under Applicable Law.

 

Section 5.5

 

 _Real Estate Transfer Taxes_. The Company shall pay all state or local real
property transfer, gains or similar Taxes, if any (collectively, the "

of the Company\'s and any of its Subsidiaries\' real properties, and any
penalties or interest with respect thereto, payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including supplying
in a timely manner a complete list of all real property interests held by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries and any information with respect to such
properties that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns. The portion
of the consideration allocable to the Company Fee Properties of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries shall be determined by Parent in its reasonable
discretion. The shareholders of the Company (who are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_ ) shall be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by the allocation established pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ in the
preparation of any return with respect to the Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 5.6

 

 _Director and Officer Liability_. 

 

(a)

 

Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancements of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of the current or former

(the " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided in their respective charters (or similar
constitutive documents) or bylaws or in any indemnification agreement set
forth in _Section 5.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and all such rights
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any such Indemnitees, unless an alteration or modification of such documents
is required by Applicable Law or the Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise
consents in writing thereto. 

 

(b)

 

For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person covered at or prior
to the Effective Time by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company and in effect as of the date hereof
on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of
the policy in effect on the date hereof and described in _Section 5.6_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year
equal to 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), to maintain or procure insurance
coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that if the amount of the
annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or
procure, for such six (6) year period, the most advantageous policy of
directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide each such Person covered
at or prior to the Effective Time by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance policy maintained by the Company and in effect as of the
date hereof with coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company in effect as of the date hereof.
_Section 5.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the Maximum Amount.

 

(c)

 

This _Section 5.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnitees referred to herein, their heirs and personal representatives and
shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.

 

(d)

 

If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_ , and
none of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence shall be
taken until such provision is made.

 

(e)

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including by pursuing
all reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

 

(c)

 

Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (i) subject to any

breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

Section 5.12

 

 _Financing_. 

 

(a)

 

Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Financing as set forth in the Financing Letters; provided, however, that

assist with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith,

necessary "comfort letters" in connection with the Financing and (B)
appropriate officers to sign any customary management representation letters
to its independent accountants and (v) solicit and cause to be delivered such
certificates, affidavits and instruments (including affidavits of title,

limited liability company such that, under U.S. federal income tax law, the
Company will succeed to the earnings and profits of each such Subsidiary. The
Company shall cooperate with reasonable requests of Parent in this regard.
The Company shall not make any election inconsistent with treating such
Subsidiaries following conversion or merger into a limited liability company
as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding

actions that would result in material liability or cost to the Company unless
Parent shall first agree to reimburse the Company for such liability or cost.

Financing and the payment of the Required Cash Amount, the Company will be
Solvent (or the equivalent thereof, as determined in the reasonable discretion

respective officers, agents and other representatives on a customary basis and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the

Subsidiaries, with compensation and benefits (not including equity
compensation) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the

the Company for all purposes under such plans. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor all agreements set forth in
_Section 5.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent of the
respective terms of such agreements. Subject to the preceding sentence,
nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent to amend or terminate any particular Plan or
any other particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or as
requiring the Surviving Corporation or Parent to offer to continue the
employment of any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any period
of time or to offer to continue (other than as required by its written terms)
any Plan.

 

(b)

 

The Company shall take all action necessary to amend its 2000 Executive Long

Section 8.5

 

 _Amendments, Modification and Waiver_. 

 

(a)

 

Except as may otherwise be provided herein, any provision of this Agreement
may be amended, modified or waived by the parties hereto, by action taken by
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, prior to the Closing
Date if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub or, in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
_provided_ , that no such amendment, modification or waiver by the Company
shall be effective unless it is authorized by the Special Committee; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall not be made any amendment that by Applicable Law or rule
of the NYSE requires further approval by the Company\'s shareholders without
such further approval.

 

(b)

 

No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law or in equity.

the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the parties

enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.

 

Section 8.8

Except to the extent that the laws of the State of Wisconsin are mandatorily
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or related to the Agreement
or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within the State.

 

(b)

 

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such action or proceeding in such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 8.2_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(c)

 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.8(c)_.

 

Section 8.9

 

 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic substance of the
transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 8.10

 

 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 5.5_ , this
Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Company and its successors and
permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub,
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not
be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right; _provided_ , that
the Indemnitees and insured parties referred to in _Section 5.6_ shall be
third party beneficiaries entitled to enforce the provisions of _Section 5.6_
of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Affected Employees
referred to in _Section 5.16(a)_ and the individuals party to the agreements
set forth in _Section 5.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall each be
third party beneficiaries entitled to enforce the provisions of _Section
5.16(a)_.

 

Section 8.11

 

 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with any exhibits or schedules
hereto, the Company Disclosure Letters and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements or
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 8.12

 

 _Counterparts; Fax Signatures; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. Each of the parties hereto (i) has agreed to permit the use, from
time to time and where appropriate, of faxed signatures in order to expedite
the Closing, (ii) intends to be bound by its respective faxed signature, (iii)
is aware that the other parties hereto will rely on the faxed signature and
(iv) acknowledges such reliance and waives any defenses to the enforcement of
