Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.5 _Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties
acknowledge that the Estimated Closing Statement will be delivered to Parent
prior to the Closing Date and therefore the estimated amount of Cash, Working
Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses included therein may be
different than the actual amount of such items were the determination
thereof been made after the Closing Date. Accordingly, this _Section_ __ _
2.5_ sets forth the process by which such estimates may be adjusted;
_provided_ that, in order to ensure that the adjustment of any such estimated
item reflects an adjustment only between the estimate thereof and the actual
amount thereof, each of Cash, Working Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses shall be finally determined applying solely the Working Capital
Methodology ( _i.e._ , no accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies
inconsistent with the Working Capital Methodology may be used by Parent (or,
if applicable, the Accounting Firm) in calculating any such items, as the
sole purpose of the purchase price adjustment is to measure the difference, if
any, between the estimate of an item and the actual amount of such item).

 

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to Representative a statement (" _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
in reasonable detail ParentÂ’s good faith calculation of the following items
(each, a " _Closing Item_ "): (i) Cash (as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ " _Final Cash_ "); (ii) Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, " _Final Working Capital_
"); (iii) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company Group
(as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, " _Final
Indebtedness_ "); (iv) the aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses (as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, " _Final
Transaction Expenses_ "); and (v) the resulting calculation of the Final
Purchase Price.

(b) In order that Representative may independently audit the Closing
Statement and the application of the Working Capital Methodology in respect of
the determination of Final Cash, Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness and
Final Transaction Expenses, the Company Group shall, upon reasonable request,
provide Representative and its Agents with copies of financial and other
pertinent information of the Company Group and reasonable access during
business hours to the Company GroupÂ’s Agents.

 

(c) Representative shall have 30 calendar days after its receipt of the
Closing Statement (" _Review Period_ ") within which to review ParentÂ’s
calculation of the Closing Items. If Representative disputes any of the
Closing Items, Representative shall notify Parent in writing of its objection
to such Closing Items within the Review Period, together with a description
of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the extent
reasonably possible) (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Closing Items, as set forth
in the Closing Statement, shall become final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties unless Representative delivers to Parent a Dispute Notice within the
Review Period. If Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the
Closing Statement not objected to by Representative in the Dispute Notice
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, and Parent and
Representative shall, within 30 calendar days following ParentÂ’s receipt of
such Dispute Notice (" _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences with respect to the matters set forth in the
Dispute Notice and any such written resolution shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any
amounts remain in dispute, then each of Parent and Representative shall
submit all items remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Parent and Representative

 



14  (" _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution by delivering within 10 calendar days
after the expiration of the Resolution Period to the Accounting Firm their
written position with respect to such items remaining in dispute. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_
shall be allocated by the Accounting Firm between Parent and Representative
based on the portion of the contested amount with respect to which each party
did not prevail relative to the aggregate contested amount ( _i.e._ , for
illustrative purposes only, if Representative prevailed with respect to 40% of
the aggregate contested amount, then Representative would be responsible for
60% of such fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm). The Accounting Firm
shall determine, based solely on the submissions by Representative and Parent,
and not by independent review, only those issues set forth in the Dispute
Notice that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such
disputed item which is equal to or between the final values proposed by Parent
and Representative in their respective submissions. Parent and
Representative shall request that the Accounting Firm make a decision with
respect to all disputed items within 10 Business Days after the submissions of
Parent and Representative, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The
final determination with respect to all disputed items shall be set forth in
a written statement by the Accounting Firm delivered to Parent and
Representative and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.
Parent and Representative shall promptly execute any reasonable engagement
letter requested by the Accounting Firm and shall each cooperate fully with
the Accounting Firm, including by providing the information, data and work
papers used by Parent and Representative to prepare or calculate the Closing
Items, making its personnel and accountants available to explain any such
information, data or work papers, so as to enable the Accounting Firm to make
such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable.

 

(d) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price
(such excess amount, " _Excess Amount_ "), then, within two Business Days
after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (i) Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal
to the Excess Amount and (ii) Parent and Representative shall direct the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price (such
shortfall amount, " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then, within two Business Days
after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, Parent and Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent
to pay to Parent an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of the Shortfall
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and if the Shortfall Amount is less
than the Adjustment Escrow Amount (such difference, " _Remaining Holdback
Amount_ "), then Parent and Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to
pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Remaining Holdback Amount.

 

(f) All amounts ultimately payable to the Equityholders pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be allocated among and paid to the Equityholders
as if such amounts had been included in the Closing Merger Consideration as
determined by Representative. All amounts paid under this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_
to the Paying Agent shall thereafter be paid by the Paying Agent to the
Equityholders.

(g) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be deemed
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing
to Parent, PCP Merger Sub, Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof.

Company will provide Parent and its authorized Agents reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the properties,
books, records and senior management of the Company Group in connection with
the transition of the ownership of the Company Group to Parent, so long as
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the
Company Group and

 



35  occurs in a manner that the Company reasonably determines to be appropriate
to protect the confidentiality of the transactions contemplated hereby. All
requests for such access shall be directed to Financial Technology Partners
LP and FTP Securities LLC or such other Persons designated by the Company in
writing.

(e) The Company shall promptly, after becoming aware thereof, provide Parent
with notice describing any material facts or circumstances pursuant to which

thereof by rules or guidance issued by any Payment Network, in connection with
a substantial data compromise.

 

Section 6.2 _Confidentiality_. Information obtained by Parent, its Affiliates
and its and their Agents in connection with the transactions contemplated by

communication to any such Antitrust Authority and incorporate reasonable
comments thereto; (C) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Antitrust Authority in respect of any filing,

Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and (D) furnish
each other with copies of all substantive correspondence, filings and written
communications between such Party and their Affiliates and their respective

Agreement as promptly as possible; and (ii) avoid any lawsuit by any

any waiting period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the Closing beyond the End Date. Parent shall be responsible for
payment of all filing fees required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Law.

required by applicable law (including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,

(a) no Party hereto shall, and all Parties hereto shall not permit any of
their respective Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press
or other public release or announcement (a " _Press Release_ ") concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of both Parent and Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), provided that, if required
by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, the
disclosing Party shall endeavor, on a basis that is commercially reasonable
under the circumstances, to provide an opportunity to the other Parties to

37 Section 6.6 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Parent will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to) take any action
with respect to the Company Group or PCP that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the
same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in IRS Notices 2001 16 and 2008 111. Without the
prior written consent of Representative, Parent will not, and will not permit
the Company Group or PCP to, (a) amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (b) make any election under Code Sections 336(e) or Section 338 or
any other similar provisions of local, state or foreign law, (c) enter into
any voluntary disclosure agreements or initiate discussions with any
Governmental Body regarding Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (d) take
any action relating to Taxes that could create a Tax liability (other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement), in each case if any of the
foregoing could result in the Equityholders or any of their Affiliates or
direct or indirect Equityholders being liable for any amounts, including under
this Agreement (including any Taxes that would be included in Working Capital)
or to any Governmental Body.

 

(b) Representative shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be timely
prepared and filed, all income Tax Returns of the Company Group and PCP with
respect to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date.
Parent shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be timely prepared and
filed, all non-income Tax Returns of the Company Group and PCP with respect
to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date but
which are not due until after the Closing Date. Representative and Parent
shall (i) prepare any such Tax Returns it prepares consistent with past
practices of the Company Group and PCP, and (ii) provide the other party the
right to review and comment on such Tax Returns no later than twenty (20) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions),
such comments to be delivered to the party preparing such Tax Returns within
ten (10) days following the reviewing partyÂ’s receipt of such Tax Returns.
Representative and Parent shall reflect any comments as are
reasonably requested by the reviewing party on such Tax Returns unless
otherwise required by applicable law. In the event of a disagreement
concerning preparation of such Tax Returns or any comments made by either
Representative or Parent with respect to such Tax Returns, Representative and
Parent shall use their respective good faith efforts to resolve any such
disagreement. In the event that Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve any such disagreement within ten (10) days (or such longer period as
they mutually agree), Representative and Parent shall refer such disagreement
to the Accounting Firm pursuant to the general procedures of _Section_ __ _
2.5(c)_, mutatis mutandis, whose decision shall be final and binding, and the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne between Representative
and Parent in the manner contemplated under _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_.

 

(c) If the Closing occurs in 2017, Representative shall timely prepare and
file, or shall cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company Group (and PCP) with respect to any Straddle Period (each a "
_Straddle Period Return_ "). Representative shall prepare such Straddle Period
Returns and file the same in a manner consistent with the prior practices of
the Company Group and PCP (except as otherwise required by applicable law).
Representative will permit Parent to review and comment on each such Straddle
Period Return at least 20 days prior to the Representative filing such
returns and, unless otherwise required by applicable law, will make such
revisions to such returns as are reasonably requested by Parent. In the event
of a disagreement concerning preparation of the Straddle Period Returns or any
comments made by Parent with respect to such Tax Returns, Representative and
Parent shall use their respective good faith efforts to resolve any such
disagreement. In the event that Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve any such disagreement within ten (10) days (or such longer period as
they mutually agree), Representative and Parent shall refer such disagreement
to the Accounting Firm pursuant

 



38  to the general procedures of _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_, mutatis mutandis,
whose decision shall be final and binding, and the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm will be borne between Representative and Parent in the manner
contemplated under _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_. If the Closing occurs in 2018,
Parent shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be timely prepared and
filed, all Straddle Period Returns of the Company Group and PCP. In that
event, the identical procedures, time deadlines and dispute resolution
provisions shall apply as set forth above in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_
governing the preparation of such returns by the Representative, except that
the rights and obligations of the Representative as set forth above shall fall
upon the Parent, and vice versa. The out-of-pocket costs (such as
accountantsÂ’ fees) incurred by each party in the preparation and filling of
all Tax Returns described in _Sections 6.6(b)_ and _(c)_ shall be borne on a
post-closing basis by the Company Group or PCP.

 

(d) In the case of any Straddle Period, and for purposes of determining
hereunder the amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Post-Closing Tax Period generally, the amount of Taxes attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be (i) in the case of Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis (such as certain franchise Taxes, real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes not
described in (i) above (such as Taxes that are based upon or related to income
or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), and employment-related Taxes), the amount of any such Taxes shall
be determined on an interim closing of the books basis as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on Closing Date, provided that the
expenses and deductions incurred by the Company Group or PCP incident to or
arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such as the
Transaction Expenses) shall be allocated or apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the extent permitted by applicable law.

(e) Representative and Parent shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns, the preparation and submission of financial information in public
filings, and any tax audits, tax proceedings, or other tax-related claims
(each a " _Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include, providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such matters, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information,
and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.
If there is any Contest after the Closing Date regarding any Taxes that could
create a Tax liability that could result in the Equityholders or any of their
Affiliates or direct or indirect Equityholders being liable for any amounts,
including under this Agreement (including any Taxes that would be included in
Working Capital) or to any Governmental Body, Representative shall have the
right, at its own expense, to participate in such Contest (and in no event
shall Parent settle, compromise and/or concede any such Contest without the
prior written consent of Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall
control the defense of any such Contest. In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ and the provisions of _Article
VIII_ , the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ shall control.

(f) Parent on the one hand and Representative on the other hand shall share
equally any transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording,
registration and any similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable
in connection with the Merger or the PCP Merger. The parties shall cooperate
in filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to permit any such
Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid, and to obtain any exemption or refund of
any such Transfer Taxes.

 



39 (g) Prior to Closing, PCP and the Company Group shall undertake their
reasonable best efforts to submit to a shareholder vote the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G(c)) to receive any
and all payments that could be deemed "parachute payments" under Code Section
280G(b), in a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval requirements for
the exemption of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and any regulations (including
proposed regulations) promulgated thereunder. Such vote shall establish the
applicable "disqualified individualÂ’s" right to the payment or other
compensation. In addition, prior to such shareholder vote, PCP shall undertake
its reasonable best efforts to (i) provide adequate disclosure to all
shareholders of PCP entitled to vote of all material facts concerning all
payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to a
"disqualified individual" under Code Section 280G in a manner that satisfies
Code Section 280G(b)(5), and (ii) obtain from each "disqualified individual"
who is entitled to receive payments that could be deemed "parachute payments"
under Code Section 280G a written waiver of his or her rights to such
payments in the event of a failure to approve the payments by at least 75% of
the PCP shares entitled to vote. For the avoidance of doubt, neither PCP nor
any member of the Company Group shall be deemed to have breached this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(g)_ by reason of either (x) the failure to obtain a waiver
from any applicable disqualified individual or (y) arrangements entered into
by or otherwise at the direction of Parent (" _Parent Arrangements_ ").

Section 6.7 _Letters of Credit_. _Schedule_ __ _ 6.7_ sets forth a complete
list of all letters of credit of the Company Group (collectively, the "
_Letters of Credit_ "). Prior to the Closing, Parent shall make arrangements
to replace or cash collateralize, effective at Closing, such Letters of Credit
and provide written evidence thereof to the Company.

Section 6.8 _Investigation; No Other Representations; Non_ _-Reliance_. In
entering into this Agreement, Parent (for itself and on behalf of the other
Parent Persons) hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Persons have
relied solely upon the specific representations and warranties expressly made
by the Company in _Article III_ and PCP in _Article IV_ , in each case, as
qualified by the Schedules (" _Express Representations_ "). Parent (for itself
and on behalf of the other Parent Persons) hereby: (a) specifically
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the Express Representations, none of
PCP, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Equityholder or any other Person
is making and has not made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, at law or in equity, in respect of PCP, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, assets, liabilities,
operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise), including
with respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any
assets, the nature or extent of any liabilities, the prospects of the
business, the effectiveness or the success of any operations, or the accuracy
or completeness of any confidential information memoranda, management
presentations, projections, documents, material or other information
(financial or otherwise) regarding PCP and the Company Group furnished or made
available to any Parent Person in any data room, management presentation or
in any other manner or form in expectation of, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) specifically and irrevocably disclaims
that any Parent Person is relying upon or has relied upon any such other
representations or warranties that may have been made by any Nonparty or any
other Person and acknowledges and agrees that PCP, the Company (for itself and
on behalf of the Company Subsidiaries), the Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates and Agents hereby specifically disclaim any such other
representation or warranty made by any Nonparty or any other Person; (c)
specifically and irrevocably disclaims any obligation or duty by PCP, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates or any other Person to make any disclosures not required to be
disclosed by the Express Representations; and (d) specifically acknowledges
and agrees that each of Parent, PCP Merger Sub, and Merger Sub is entering
into this Agreement and acquiring PCP and the Company Group subject only to
the Express Representations, all of which representations shall expire and
terminate at the Closing as set forth in _Article VII_. Without limiting the
generality of any of the foregoing, Parent (for itself and on behalf of the
other Parent Persons) hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (i) none of PCP,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Equityholders or any of their
respective Affiliates or Agents makes any representation or warranty regarding
any third-party beneficiary rights or

 



40  other rights which any Parent Person might claim under any studies, reports,
tests or analyses prepared by any third parties for PCP, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, even if the same were made
available for review by the Parent Persons; and (ii) none of the documents,
information or other materials provided to any Parent Person at any time or in
any format by or on behalf of PCP, the Company Group, or by any Equityholder
or any of their respective Affiliates or Agents constitutes legal advice and
Parent (for itself and on behalf of the other Parent Persons) hereby waives
all rights to assert that it received any legal advice therefrom or that it
had any sort of attorney-client relationship with any of such Persons.

ARTICLE VII 

SURVIVAL

 

Section 7.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of PCP and the
Company set forth in this Agreement (and in any document, instrument or
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement) shall terminate
effective as of the Closing and shall not, for any purpose, survive the
Closing and, following the Closing, subject to the last sentence of 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_, no Person shall be entitled to any recovery in respect
of any inaccuracy or breach thereof or to make any claim or demand whatsoever
(including any claim of detrimental reliance or breach of contract
or otherwise), bring any cause of action (whether at law, in equity or
otherwise) or assert any other right or remedy (whether in contract or in
tort). In addition, from and after the Closing, no Person shall be entitled to
make any claim or demand (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise), bring
any cause of action (whether at law, in equity or otherwise) in respect of any
failure of PCP or the Company to perform or comply with any covenant requiring
performance or compliance prior to the Closing. The Parties expressly intend
that the foregoing alter any applicable statutes of limitation. Parent (for
itself and on behalf of the Parent Persons) hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the limitations on liability were expressly bargained for and are a
material inducement for each of PCP and the Company (for itself and on behalf
of the Equityholders and Company Persons) to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, hereby knowingly, voluntarily and
irrevocably waives any and all rights and remedies to which it would otherwise
be entitled (whether at law, in equity or otherwise) in respect of any such
inaccuracy, breach, non-performance or non-compliance.

 

Section 7.2 _Representations and Warranties Insurance_. The Parties
acknowledge that (x) Parent has obtained those certain representations and
warranties insurance policies with AIG and Berkshire Hathaway (" _R andW
Policy_") to provide a source of recovery to Parent for losses incurred by a
Parent Person arising out of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy
of a representation or warranty of PCP or the Company, and Parent shall have a
right to recover from the RandW Policy for such losses and (y) subrogation
rights under such RandW Policy are limited to common law fraud.

This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written instrument

Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term had never been contained herein.
Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts and delivered via fax or email.

 

Section 9.2 _Waiver_. Subject to the express limitations herein, at any time
prior to the Closing: (a) the Company and PCP may (i) extend the date or time
by which Parent is required to perform any covenant or other obligation
hereunder, (ii) waive any failure of Parent to comply with any covenant or
satisfy any condition or (iii) waive any breach by Parent of any
representation or warranty made thereby herein; and (b) Parent may (i) extend
the date or time by which the Company or PCP is required to perform any
covenant or other obligation hereunder, (ii) waive any failure of the
Company or PCP to comply with any covenant or satisfy any condition or (iii)
waive any breach by the Company or PCP of any representation or warranty made
thereby herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a writing signed by such Party. No failure or delay on the part of any
Party in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
construed as a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right shall preclude other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right.

 

Section 9.3 _Non_ _-Recourse_. Parent (on behalf of itself and the Parent
Persons), PCP Merger Sub, Merger Sub, PCP and the Company (on behalf of
itself and the Company Persons) hereby acknowledge and agree that, subject to
_Article VII_ and the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, any
claim, demand or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, granted by statute or predicated on any other cognizable theory)
that arises under or by reason of, or is based on, connected with or otherwise
relates in any manner to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the sale process and the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement) may be made or brought against only a Party,
and no Person who is not a Party, including any past, present or future
member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate or Agent of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any Party, and any past, present or future member,
partner, equityholder, Affiliate or Agent of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Nonparties_ "), shall have
any liability or obligation in respect of any such claim, demand or cause of
action and Parent (on behalf of itself and the Parent Persons), PCP Merger
Sub, Merger Sub, PCP and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company
Persons) hereby covenant never to bring any such claim, demand or cause of
action against any Nonparty, all such claims, demands and causes of actions
being hereby released and the right to make or bring such claims, demands or
causes of

 



43  action being hereby knowingly, voluntarily and irrevocably forever waived.
In furtherance of the foregoing, PCP and the Company (on behalf of itself and
the Company Subsidiaries), hereby irrevocably releases from any liability,
and hereby knowingly, voluntarily and irrevocably forever waives any right it
has to bring any claim, demand or cause of action (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, granted by statute or predicated on any other
cognizable theory) against, each current and former director, officer and
other Agent of PCP and the Company Group in respect of any act, failure to act
or omission of such Person occurring prior to the Closing. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall limit the common law liability of (a) any
Equityholder or Knowledge Party for fraud in the event such Equityholder or
Knowledge Party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have willfully and knowingly committed fraud against Parent with the specific
intent to deceive and mislead Parent, in the making by the Company and PCP of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ of this Agreement or (b) Parent or any equityholder thereof for fraud in
the event Parent or any such equityholder is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have willfully and knowingly committed fraud
against the Company or PCP, with the specific intent to deceive and mislead
the Company or PCP, in the making by Parent of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article V_ of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 _Third-Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_. The Equityholders are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement by virtue of the
consideration that they are entitled to receive hereunder, it being understood
that the Representative shall have the right to enforce such rights on behalf
of the Equityholders. Nonparties are intended to be third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement for purposes of enforcing the limitations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, _Article VII_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. Except as set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, there are no third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated by any Party without the
prior written consent of each of the other Parties; ___provided_ , _however_
, (i) Representative may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any of its Affiliates without prior written consent and Parent
may assign its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates (
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such assignment shall not relieve Parent of
any liability or obligation in connection with this Agreement), and (ii)
Parent may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or
more of ParentÂ’s subsidiaries without prior written consent, but no such
assignment will relieve Parent of any obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment or delegation in violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ will be
null and void _ab initio_.

Section 9.5 _Applicable Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement and the
legal relations between the Parties shall be governed by and interpreted and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Any and all
claims, controversies and causes of action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort or statute, shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations,
without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or other rule that would result
in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. The state and
federal courts located within the state of Delaware shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any and all disputes between the Parties, whether in law or
in equity, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby and the Parties consent to and
agree to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The Parties
hereby irrevocably waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
and shall not assert in any such dispute, any claim that: (a) such Party is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts; (b) such Party and
such PartyÂ’s property is immune from any legal process of, in or relating to
such courts; or (c) any action or other proceeding commenced in such courts is
brought in an inconvenient forum. The mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.12_ (or in such other manner as may be permitted by law)
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and the Parties hereby
irrevocably waive any objections to service accomplished in the manner
provided herein. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive all right to a trial by
jury in any action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



44 Section 9.6 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties hereby stipulate that
irreparable damage will occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or is otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would
be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties
and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement (including any order sought
by PCP or the Company to cause Parent, PCP Merger Sub or Merger Sub to
consummate the Closing and any order sought by Parent to cause PCP or the
Company to consummate the Closing), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or
threatened breach. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ and each Party hereby irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

Section 9.7 _Rules of Construction_. Each of Parent, PCP Merger Sub, Merger
Sub, PCP, the Company and Representative is sometimes referred to herein as a
" _Party_." The Parties have been represented by sophisticated counsel in the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and have participated jointly in
the drafting of this Agreement and, therefore, irrevocably waive the
application of any law, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement. Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement are attached
hereto and by this reference are hereby incorporated herein for all purposes.
The recitals are hereby incorporated herein for all purposes. Any reference
in this Agreement to an "Article," "Exhibit," "Annex," "Section" or "Schedule"
refers to the corresponding Article, Exhibit, Section or Schedule of or to
this Agreement, unless expressly provided otherwise. The table of contents
and the headings of Articles, Annexes, Exhibits and Sections of this Agreement
are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement and
shall be disregarded in construing the language herein. The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder", "hereof," and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The word "including" (in its various
forms) means "including without limitation." The word "material" and words of
similar import refer to a level of significance that would cause a
knowledgeable and sophisticated investor to elect not to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Where this
Agreement states that a Party "shall," "will" or "must" perform in some manner
or otherwise act or omit to act, it means the Party is legally obligated to
do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a statute is deemed
also to refer to any amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the
relevant time and any reference to any law includes the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any reference to an agreement or other document as of
a given date means the agreement or other document as amended, supplemented
and modified from time to time through such date. All references to "$" and
dollars shall be deemed to refer to U.S. currency unless otherwise
specifically provided.

 

Section 9.8 _Schedules_. Information reflected in the schedules attached
hereto (" _Schedules_ ") is not necessarily limited to information required
by this Agreement to be disclosed or otherwise set forth therein and may be
included for informational purposes. Headings and subheadings have been
inserted in the Schedules for convenience of reference only and shall not
have the effect of amending or changing the express description thereof as set
forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in this Agreement or
any Schedule referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure would apply to such other Sections. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule is intended to imply that such amounts, higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material or are within or
outside the ordinary course of

 



45  business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any Schedule in any
dispute between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items
are or are not material) or may constitute an event or condition which could
be considered to have a Material Adverse Effect. No disclosure on a Schedule
admitting or indicating a possible breach or violation of any contract, law or
order shall be construed as an admission or indication that an actual breach
or violation exists, has actually occurred or will occur. The Parties do not
assume any responsibility to any Person that is not a Party to this Agreement
for the accuracy of any information set forth in the Schedules. Subject to
applicable law, the information on the Schedules is disclosed in confidence
for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the
confidentiality provisions of any other agreements, including the
Confidentiality Agreement, entered into by the Parties or their Affiliates.
Moreover, in disclosing the information in the Schedules, each Party
expressly does not waive any attorney client privilege associated with such
information or any protection afforded by the work product doctrine with
respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein.

 

Section 9.9 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
If the date specified for giving any notice or taking any action is not a
Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given
or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the
date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of
such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next date which is a Business Day.

 

Section 9.10 _Representative_. Representative is hereby appointed to act as
representative and attorney-in-fact of the Equityholders as more fully set
forth on _Annex E_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be
taken by Representative in its capacity as such, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the Equityholders. Each of PCP, the
Company, PCP Merger Sub, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees that
Representative is a Party to this Agreement solely to perform certain
administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, Representative shall have no
liability to, and shall not be liable for any losses of, any of PCP, the
Company, Parent, PCP Merger Sub or Merger Sub in connection with any
obligations of Representative under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
such losses shall be proven to be the direct result of willful misconduct in
bad faith by Representative in connection with the performance of its
obligations hereunder.

 

Section 9.11 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company hereby expressly agree, on behalf of themselves,
the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, its Affiliates and
subsidiaries and their respective current and future members, partners,
equityholders, Agents and each of the successors and assigns of the foregoing
(all such Persons, " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any
successor thereto) may represent Representative, any Equityholder or any other
Nonparty in connection with any claim, demand, cause of action or other
dispute or matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement
entered into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of PCP
and the Company Group, and each of Parent and the Company on their own behalf
and on behalf of the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably
waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto. Parent and the Company each acknowledge that
the foregoing provision applies whether or not Kirkland and Ellis LLP provides
legal services to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any
subsidiary thereof after the Closing Date.

 



46 (b) In furtherance of the foregoing, all emails and other communications in
furtherance of or related to the provision of legal services by Kirkland and
Ellis LLP and Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP to PCP, the Company Group,
the Equityholders or any Agent thereof at any time prior to the Closing that
are entitled to the protections afforded by the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence shall belong solely to Representative and
shall be exclusively controlled thereby and shall not pass to or be claimed
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, any subsidiary
thereof or any other Person and from and after the Closing none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, any subsidiary thereof or any
other Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the Waiving
Parties will seek to obtain the same by any process.

(c) Parent, PCP and the Company, on behalf of themselves and the Waiving
Parties, hereby acknowledge and agree that all Sale Materials are the
exclusive property of Representative and, as such, Representative shall have
exclusive control over access, disclosure and use thereof. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Parent, PCP and the Company (on behalf of themselves and the
Waiving Parties) hereby stipulate that in no event shall any prior drafts of
any Deal Documents or Sale Materials be admissible by any Parent Person (or
any other Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the other
Waiving Parties) in any action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)_ shall not be deemed to limit otherwise
appropriate discovery in litigation under applicable law.

Section 9.12 _Notices_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices,
requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby must be in writing and must
be delivered by hand or sent by overnight courier service or by email as set
