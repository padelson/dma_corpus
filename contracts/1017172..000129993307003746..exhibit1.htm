a general release of claims in a form provided by Parent and/or the Surviving LLC, such severance

employer prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in service or similar
rules; <U>provided</U> that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent consistent with applicable
law and applicable tax qualification requirements, and subject to the consent of any applicable
insurance carrier or health maintenance organization, Parent and/or the Surviving LLC shall make
available, or cause to be made available, to those employees of Company who become employees of
Parent and/or the Surviving LLC, medical, dental, disability and other welfare benefits plans and

respective employees, without regard to any preexisting condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or similar limitation; <U>provided</U>, and only to the extent, that any analogous
restriction applied to such employee under an analogous plan of Company had been satisfied as of
the Closing Date. In determining an employee&#146;s share of the cost of coverage under any plan or

the Surviving LLC shall make commercially reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any
pre-Closing co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each comparable

reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words
&#147;<B>include</B>,&#148; &#147;<B>includes</B>&#148; and &#147;<B>including</B>&#148; when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed
by the words &#147;<B>without limitation</B>.&#148; The phrase &#147;<B>made available</B>&#148; in this Agreement shall mean that
the information referred to has been made available if requested by the party to whom such
information is to be made available. The phrases &#147;<B>the date of this Agreement</B>&#148;, &#147;<B>the date hereof</B>&#148;,
and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the
Execution Date. A party conducting its business or other affairs or taking any action in the
&#147;<B>ordinary course of business</B>&#148; (or in the &#147;<B>ordinary course</B>&#148;) means that such an action taken by or
on behalf of such party shall not be deemed to have been taken in the &#147;ordinary course of business&#148;
(or in the &#147;ordinary course&#148;) unless: (a)&nbsp;such action is consistent with such party&#146;s past
practices in all material respects and is taken in the ordinary course of such party&#146;s operations
and (b)&nbsp;such action is not required to be authorized by such party&#146;s stockholders. The phrases
&#147;<B>material breach</B>&#148; or &#147;<B>material default</B>&#148; of or under any agreement, contract or like arrangement by
a party means the occurrence of any inaccuracy in or breach of, or any failure to comply with or
perform, a representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision of such agreement,
contract or like arrangement, if such inaccuracy or failure, in any way, materially and adversely
would affect the value of, or such party&#146;s rights, title or interest in, any of its assets or
property, or its rights and obligations under such agreement, contract or arrangement. Any event,
change, condition or effect being &#147;<B>material</B>&#148; with respect to any entity or group of entities means
any event, change, condition, circumstance or effect that is material to the condition (financial
or otherwise), properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations
or results of operations of such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.4 <U>Counterparts; Facsimile Delivery</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and delivered by facsimile, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.5 <U>Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest</U>. This Agreement, including the Exhibits,
the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the
Parent Ancillary Agreements and the Company Ancillary Agreements, (a)&nbsp;constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force
and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with
its terms, and (b)&nbsp;are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder, except as set forth in Sections&nbsp;2.6(a), and (c)-(e), 2.7, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and 6.14.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.6 <U>Severability</U>. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and
the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.7 <U>Remedies Cumulative</U>. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.8 <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of Delaware without reference to such state&#146;s principles of conflicts of law. Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Delaware, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them
in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction
and such process.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.9 <U>Rules of Construction</U>. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.10 <U>Assignment</U>. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether
by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.11 <U>Waiver of Jury Trial</U>. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.12 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
