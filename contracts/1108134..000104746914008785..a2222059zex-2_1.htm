 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX prior to the Effective Time BHLB may revise the structure for effecting the Merger described in Section 2.1 or the Bank Merger including, without limitation, by substituting a wholly owned subsidiary for BHLB or Berkshire Bank, as applicable, provided that (i) any such subsidiary shall become a party to, and shall agree to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement; (ii) there are no adverse Federal or state income tax consequences to BHLB, Berkshire Bank, Hampden, Hampden Bank or to the BHLB or Hampden stockholders, and nothing would prevent the rendering of the opinions contemplated in Sections 9.2.5 and 9.3.5, as a result of the modification; (iii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Hampden Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in amount; and (iv) such modification will not delay materially the Closing or jeopardize or delay (x) the calling and holding of the Hampden Stockholders Meeting or the solicitation of proxies in connection therewith or (y) materially the receipt of any Regulatory Approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the Merger or otherwise cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article IX not to be capable of being fulfilled.

ARTICLE III 
CONVERSION OF SHARES 

   

    3.1 _ Conversion of Hampden Common Stock; Merger
Consideration. _ 

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of BHLB, Hampden or the holders of any of the shares of Hampden Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms: 

  

  

 3.1.1 Each share of BHLB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. 

  

 3.1.2 All shares of Hampden Common Stock held in the treasury of Hampden and each share of Hampden Common Stock owned by BHLB prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted) ("Treasury Stock") shall, at the Effective Time, cease to exist, and such shares, including any Certificates therefor, shall be 

  

      

  

canceled as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or
distribution shall be made in consideration therefor.

  

 3.1.3 Subject to a potential adjustment as provided in Section 10.1.9, each outstanding share of Hampden Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive 0.81 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of BHLB Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration"). 

   

 3.1.4 Upon the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Hampden Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this Section 3.1 represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that were declared or made by Hampden on such shares of Hampden Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

 3.1.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BHLB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of BHLB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, BHLB shall pay to each former holder of Hampden Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of BHLB Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of BHLB Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all shares of Hampden Common Stock owned by a Hampden stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of BHLB Common Stock issuable to such Hampden stockholder. 

  

 3.1.6 If BHLB changes (or the BHLB Board sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of BHLB Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. If Hampden changes (or the Hampden Board sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Hampden Common Stock (or Rights thereto) outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. 

  

  

    
 3.2 _ Procedures for Exchange of Hampden Common Stock. _ 

  

  

 3.2.1 _ BHLB to Make Merger Consideration Available._ After the Closing and at or prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Hampden Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares pursuant to this Article III and shall instruct the Exchange Agent to issue such cash and shares of BHLB Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2 (such cash and shares of BHLB Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest thereon) being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

  

 3.2.2 _ Exchange of Certificates._ BHLB shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, not later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a 

  

      

  

Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal for return to the
Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the Hampden Common Stock represented by such
Certificates shall have been converted as a result of the Merger, if any. The
letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.

  

 3.2.3 _ Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time._ The holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding Hampden Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect to such Hampden Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of BHLB Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 3.2.4 _ Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders._ If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 3.2.5 _ Closing of Transfer Books._ From and after the Closing Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Hampden of the Hampden Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.2. 

  

 3.2.6 _ Return of Exchange Fund._ At any time following the nine (9) month period after the Effective Time, BHLB shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to BHLB (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither BHLB nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 

  

      

  

 3.2.7 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof. 

  

 3.2.8 _ Withholding._ BHLB or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Hampden Common Stock such amounts as BHLB (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by BHLB or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Hampden Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by BHLB or the Exchange Agent. 

  

  

    
 3.3 _ Treatment of Hampden Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards. _ 

  

  

 3.3.1 _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 3.3.1_ sets forth all of the outstanding Hampden stock options (each, a "Hampden Stock Option") as of the date hereof. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Hampden stock option, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be terminated and the holder thereof shall be paid by Hampden immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of Hampden Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time over the applicable per share exercise price of that option by (ii) the number of shares of Hampden Common Stock that the holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of that option) had that holder exercised that option immediately before the Effective Time, less applicable tax withholding. Subject to the foregoing, the Hampden Equity Incentive Plan and all Hampden stock options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Hampden shall take such actions as may be necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3.1, including, without limitation, the provision of any notices to holders of Hampden stock options as may be provided for in the Hampden Equity Incentive Plan and the adoption of any necessary amendments to such plans. 

  

 3.3.2 At the Effective Time, if the terms of the Hampden Equity Plan or the underlying award agreement so provide, each share of restricted Hampden Common Stock issued pursuant to the Hampden Equity Plan ("Hampden Restricted Stock") that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Hampden Common Stock that was formerly Hampden Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1.3. 

  

 3.3.3 The shares of BHLB Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Hampden Stock Options and underlying each Converted Restricted Stock Award shall be registered with the SEC under the Merger Registration Statement. 

  

  

    
 3.4 _ Bank Merger. _ 

  

 BHLB intends to cause the merger of Hampden Bank with and into Berkshire Bank, with Berkshire Bank as the surviving institution, but retains the right to hold Hampden Bank as a separate subsidiary. Subject to the foregoing and in BHLB\'s sole determination, following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, BHLB will cause Berkshire Bank, and Hampden will cause Hampden Bank, to execute and deliver an agreement and plan of merger in respect of the Bank Merger. 

        

    
 3.5 _ Reservation of Shares. _ 

  

 BHLB shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the BHLB Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of BHLB Common Stock to the Hampden stockholders in accordance with this Article III.

public body or authority having jurisdiction over the affairs of Hampden or

 4.6 _ Financial Statements. _ 

  

  

 4.6.1 The Hampden Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices throughout the periods covered by such reports, and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations and changes in shareholders\' equity of Hampden as of and for the periods ended on the dates thereof, in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. 

  

 4.6.2 Hampden has previously made available to BHLB the Hampden Financial Statements. The Hampden Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods ending on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q. 

   

 4.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition included in the Hampden Financial Statements or in the Hampden Regulatory Reports, Hampden did not have any liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such Hampden Financial Statements or in the Hampden Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully reflected or reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are not material individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and subject, in the case of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes. 

  

  

    
 4.7 _ Taxes. _ 

  

 Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). Hampden, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to file such returns and reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the Effective Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental Entity prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial underpayment of United States Federal Income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local laws). The accrued but unpaid Taxes of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries did not, as of the most recent Hampden Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent Hampden balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). Hampden and its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business. Hampden management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Hampden. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that Hampden or any of the 

        

Hampden Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such
jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither Hampden nor any of the Hampden
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or
been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other
than a group the common parent of which was Hampden or (B) has any liability
for the Taxes of any Person (other than Hampden or any of the Hampden
Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise. As of the date hereof, all deficiencies proposed in writing as a
result of any audits have been paid or settled. There are no written claims or
assessments pending against Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary for any alleged
deficiency in any Tax, and neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary has been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or assessments against Hampden
or any Hampden Subsidiary. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries each have duly
and timely withheld, collected and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority all amounts required to be so withheld and paid under all
applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect
to such withheld Taxes, within the time prescribed under any applicable
law. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries have delivered to BHLB true and
complete copies of all Income Tax Returns of Hampden and the Hampden
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after October 31, 2011. Neither
Hampden nor any of the Hampden Subsidiaries is or has been a party to any
"reportable transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. §
1.6011-4(b). Neither Hampden nor any of the Hampden Subsidiaries has
distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by
another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be
governed in whole or in part by Code § 355 or Code § 361\. Neither Hampden nor
any of the Hampden Subsidiaries has been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2) during the
applicable period specified in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

  

    
 4.8 _ No Material Adverse Effect. _ 

   

 Neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary has suffered any Material Adverse Effect since June 30, 2014 and, to Hampden\'s Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Hampden. 

  

    
 4.9 _ Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults. _ 

  

  

 4.9.1 Except as set forth in _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_, neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i) any employment, consulting or severance contract or arrangement with any past or present officer, director, employee or consultant of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary, except for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, arrangement or contract providing for bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement payments, profit sharing or similar arrangements for or with any past or present officers, directors, employees or consultants of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary; (iii) any collective bargaining agreement with any labor union relating to employees of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which by its terms limits or affects the payment of dividends by Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary; (v) any instrument evidencing or related to indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $50,000, whether directly or indirectly, by way of purchase money obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or otherwise, in respect of which Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary is an obligor to any Person, which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than deposits, FHLB advances with a term to maturity not in excess of one (1) year, repurchase agreements, bankers\' acceptances, and transactions in "federal funds" or which contains financial covenants or other non-customary restrictions (other than those relating to the payment of principal and interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the Closing Date to Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary; (vi) any other agreement, written or oral, which is not terminable without cause on sixty (60) days\' notice or less without penalty or payment, or that obligates Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary for the payment of 

  

      

  

more than $30,000 annually or for the payment of more than $50,000 over its
remaining term; or (vii) any agreement (other than this Agreement), contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) that
materially restricts or limits the conduct of business by Hampden or any
Hampden Subsidiary.

  

 4.9.2 Each real estate lease that will require the consent of the lessor or its agent as a result of the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms of any such lease, is listed in _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2_ identifying the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject to any consents that may be required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary is in material default under any material contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its assets, business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default and all such material contracts, agreements, commitments, arrangements, leases, insurance policies and other instruments are listed on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2_. 

  

 4.9.3 True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available to BHLB on or before the date hereof, are listed on _Hampden Disclosure Schedules 4.9.1 and 4.9.2_ and are in full force and effect without modification on the date hereof. Except as set forth in _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3_, no such agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement (i) provides for acceleration of the vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or control of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a subsequent event; (ii) requires Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of Hampden Common Stock or determined by reference to the value of Hampden Common Stock or (iii) contains provisions which permit an employee, director or independent contractor to terminate such agreement or arrangement without cause and continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. 

  

  

    
 4.10 _ Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage. _ 

  

  

 4.10.1 Hampden and each Hampden Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Hampden or such Hampden Subsidiary, as applicable, in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the Hampden Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such consolidated statement of financial condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by a Hampden Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties used by Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the Hampden Financial Statements. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 4.10.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Hampden or such Hampden Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest (which to Hampden\'s Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby. 

  

 4.10.3 Hampden and each Hampden Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary, has received notice from any insurance carrier on or before the date hereof that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except as listed on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_, there are presently no claims pending under such policies of insurance and no notices of claim have been given by Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect (other than insurance that expires in accordance with its terms), and within the last three (3) years Hampden and each Hampden Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_ identifies all policies of insurance maintained by Hampden and each Hampden Subsidiary, including the name of the insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any applicable deductibles, as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section 4.10.3. Hampden has made available to BHLB copies of all of the policies listed on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_. 

  

  

    
 4.11 _ Legal Proceedings. _ 

  

 There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened against or affecting Hampden or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of any facts that reasonably would be expected to be the basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to it and its Subsidiaries\' businesses or, after the Effective Time, BHLB\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' businesses, or (B) reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Except as set forth on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.11_, there is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by Hampden, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

non-compliance relating to any Hampden Benefit Plan addressed to or received

Section 409A of the Code ("Hampden Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan")
has been maintained and operated in material compliance with Section 409A of
the Code .

   

 4.13.2 All Hampden Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and have been managed and administrated in all material respects in accordance with) the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.13.2_, each Hampden Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (and Hampden is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect the qualification of any of the Hampden Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending claim against any of the Hampden Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims for benefits). 

  

 4.13.3 No "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been maintained within the last six (6) years by Hampden or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of the employees or former employees of Hampden or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 4.13.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither Hampden nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a Hampden Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither Hampden nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Neither Hampden nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, with respect to any Hampden Benefit Plan, and no event or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any liability on Hampden or any of its ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on BHLB or Berkshire Bank. 

  

 4.13.5 Hampden has complied in all material respects with the notice and continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and the regulations thereunder.

To Hampden\'s Knowledge, records with respect to Hampden Benefit Plans have been maintained in compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To Hampden\'s Knowledge, neither Hampden nor any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to any of Hampden Benefit Plans has any liability for any breach of any fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No Hampden Benefit Plan fails to meet the applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code (determined without regard to whether such Hampden Benefit Plan is self-insured). 

  

 4.13.6 Hampden has not, with respect to any Hampden Benefit Plan, nor, to Hampden\'s Knowledge, has any administrator of any Hampden Benefit Plan, the related trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction which would subject Hampden, any 

  

      

  

ERISA Affiliate of Hampden, or any Hampden Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or to
any other liability under ERISA.

 4.13.8 Except as set forth on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.13.8_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of Hampden from Hampden under any Hampden Benefit Plan, (B) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Hampden Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit. Except as set forth on _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.13.8_, no payment which in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is or may reasonably be expected to be made by, from or with respect to any Hampden Benefit Plan, either alone or in conjunction with any other payment will or would properly be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code on which an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code is payable or will or would, either individually or collectively, provide for any payment by Hampden or any of its ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m). 

   

 4.13.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued Hampden Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plans (including, to the extent applicable, entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former employees of Hampden and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on the Hampden Financial Statements to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 4.13.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained by or contributed to by Hampden or its employees to fund an employee benefit plan which would constitute a Voluntary Employees\' Beneficiary Association or a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419(a) of the Code. 

  

 4.13.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been asserted or instituted or, to the Knowledge of Hampden, has been threatened against any Hampden Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary or any director, officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any Hampden Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof.

 5.7.1 Except as provided in this Agreement, neither BHLB nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

      

  

BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated group
within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). BHLB, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis) required to have been filed by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
prior to the date hereof, or requests for extensions to file such returns and
reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and
complete in all material respects. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have timely
paid or, prior to the Effective Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown
on such returns or reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental
Entity prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested
in good faith. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
underpayment of United States Federal Income Tax within the meaning of Section
6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local laws). The
unpaid accrued but unpaid Taxes of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries did not, as
of the most recent BHLB Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
most recent BHLB balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). BHLB and
its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of
business. BHLB management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any
of such audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on BHLB. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have not been
notified in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that
BHLB or any of the BHLB Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in
such jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or
been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other
than a group the common parent of which was BHLB or (B) has any liability for
the Taxes of any Person (other than BHLB or any of the BHLB Subsidiaries)
under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of
the date hereof, all deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any
audits have been paid or settled. There are no written claims or assessments
pending against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any
Tax, and neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has been notified in writing of
any proposed Tax claims or assessments against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.
BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be
so withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely
filed all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time
prescribed under any applicable law. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have
delivered to Hampden true and complete copies of all Tax Returns of BHLB and
the BHLB Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after December 31,
2011. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries is or has been a party to
any "reportable transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas.
Reg. § 1.6011-4(b). Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries has
distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by
another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed
in whole or in part by Code § 355 or Code § 361\. Neither BHLB nor any of the
BHLB Subsidiaries has been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified
in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

  

  

    
 5.8 _ No Material Adverse Effect. _ 

   

 Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has suffered any Material Adverse Effect since June 30, 2014 and, to BHLB\'s Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on BHLB. 

        

    
 5.9 _ Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage. _ 

  

  

 5.9.1 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.1_, BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all assets and properties owned by BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as applicable, in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the BHLB Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such consolidated statement of financial condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by an BHLB Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties used by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the BHLB Financial Statements. 

  

 5.9.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any, BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest (which to BHLB\'s Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby. 

   

 5.9.3 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary, has received notice from any insurance carrier on or before the date hereof that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except as listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_, there are presently no claims pending under such policies of insurance and no notices of claim have been given by BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect (other than insurance that expires in accordance with its terms), and within the last three (3) years BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_ identifies all policies of insurance maintained by BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary, including the name of the insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any applicable deductibles, as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section 5.9.3. BHLB has made available to Hampden copies of all of the policies listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_. 

  

  

    
 5.10 _ Legal Proceedings. _ 

  

 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.10_, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against or affecting BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of any facts that reasonably could be expected to form the basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or reasonably likely to result in a restriction on its or any of its Subsidiaries\' businesses or, or after the 

        

Effective Time, BHLB\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' businesses, or (B)
reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations
under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.
There is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or
regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by BHLB, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

    
 5.11 _ Compliance with Applicable Law. _ 

  

 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.11_: 

  

  

 5.11.1 To BHLB\'s Knowledge, BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its business, its conduct of business and its relationship with its employees, including, without limitation, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collections Act, the Fair Housing Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices, and neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notice to the contrary. 

  

 5.11.2 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has all material permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of BHLB, no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the approvals set forth in Section 8.3. 

  

 5.11.3 For the period beginning January 1, 2011, neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notification or any other communication from any Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator (i) asserting that BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (iii) requiring or threatening to require BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, or indicating that BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks, bank holding companies or insurance agencies, or engages in the insurance of bank deposits, restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect. The most recent regulatory rating given to Berkshire Bank as to compliance with the CRA is "Satisfactory" or better. 

   

 5.11.4 Berkshire Bank is, and immediately after the Effective Time will be, "well capitalized," as such term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, as amended from time to time. BHLB is, and immediately after the Effective Time will be, "well capitalized," as such term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB, as amended from time to time. 

  

       

    
 5.12 _ Employee Benefit Plans. _ 

  

  

 5.12.1 _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.1_ contains a list of all written and unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, deferred compensation, stock option, employee stock ownership, employee stock purchase, restricted stock, severance pay, retention, vacation, bonus or other incentive plans, all employment, change in control, consulting, severance and retention agreements, all other written employee programs, arrangements or agreements, all medical, vision, dental, disability, life insurance, workers\' compensation, employee assistance or other health or welfare plans, and all other employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, including "employee benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of employees, former employees, retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the foregoing), directors, independent contractors or other service providers to BHLB and under which employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, or other service providers of BHLB are eligible to participate (collectively, the "BHLB Benefit Plans"). BHLB has furnished or otherwise made available to Hampden true and complete copies of (i) the plan documents and summary plan descriptions for each written BHLB Benefit Plan, (ii) a summary of each unwritten BHLB Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iii) the actuarial valuation reports with respect to each tax-qualified BHLB Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan for the three (3) most recent years, (iv) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding agreements which currently implement the BHLB Benefit Plans (if applicable), (v) the most recent IRS determination letter with respect to each tax-qualified BHLB Benefit Plan (or, for a BHLB Benefit Plan maintained under a pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan, the IRS determination letter on such pre-approved plan) and (vi) all substantive correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any BHLB Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three (3) years. Each BHLB Benefit Plan that may be subject to Section 409A of the Code ("BHLB Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan") has been maintained and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 5.12.2 All BHLB Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and have been managed and administrated in all material respects in accordance with) the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.2_, each BHLB Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (and BHLB is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect the qualification of any of the BHLB Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending claim against any of the BHLB Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims for benefits). 

  

 5.12.3 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3_, no "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been maintained within the last six (6) years by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of the employees or former employees of BHLB or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 5.12.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a BHLB Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither BHLB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of 

  

      

  

Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Neither BHLB nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than
PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code with respect to any BHLB Benefit
Plan, and no event or condition exists that would reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of any liability on BHLB or any of its ERISA
Affiliates under such provisions or that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on BHLB or Berkshire Bank.

   

 5.12.5 BHLB has complied in all material respects with the notice and continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and the regulations thereunder. All reports, statements, returns and other information required to be furnished or filed with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been timely furnished, filed or both in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA and Sections 6057 through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and complete. To BHLB\'s Knowledge, records with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been maintained in compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To BHLB\'s Knowledge, neither BHLB nor any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to any of BHLB Benefit Plans has any liability for any breach of any fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No BHLB Benefit Plan fails to meet the applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code (determined without regard to whether such BHLB Benefit Plan is self-insured). 

  

 5.12.6 BHLB has not, with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, nor, to BHLB\'s Knowledge, has any administrator of any BHLB Benefit Plan, the related trusts or any trustee thereof, engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction which would subject BHLB, any ERISA Affiliate of BHLB, or any BHLB Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or to any other liability under ERISA. 

  

 5.12.7 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.7_, BHLB has no liability for retiree health and life benefits under any BHLB Benefit Plan other than any benefits required under COBRA or similar state laws. 

  

 5.12.8 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.8_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any payment (including severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of BHLB from BHLB under any BHLB Benefit Plan, (B) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any BHLB Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit. Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.8_, no payment which in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is or may reasonably be expected to be made by, from or with respect to any BHLB Benefit Plan, either alone or in conjunction with any other payment will or would properly be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code on which an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code is payable or will or would, either individually or collectively, provide for any payment by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m). 

   

 5.12.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued BHLB Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plans (including, to the extent applicable, entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former employees of BHLB and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on the BHLB Financial Statements to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 5.12.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained by or contributed to by BHLB or its employees to fund an employee benefit plan which would constitute a Voluntary 

  

      

  

Employees\' Beneficiary Association or a "welfare benefit fund" within the
meaning of Section 419(a) of the Code.

  

 5.12.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been asserted or instituted or, to the Knowledge of BHLB, has been threatened against any BHLB Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary or any director, officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any BHLB Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof.

A true and correct copy of the engagement agreement with Sandler O\'Neill and Partners, L.P., setting forth the fee payable to Sandler O\'Neill and Partners, L.P. for its services rendered to BHLB in connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement is attached to _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.13_.

BHLB and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. BHLB has designed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the 

  

      

  

meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15D-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

  

 5.17.2 BHLB\'s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. It has previously disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of the Hampden Board; (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial reporting. 

  

 5.17.3 Since December 31, 2011, (A) neither BHLB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to its knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that it or any of its subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing BHLB or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by BHLB or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its board of directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

 6.10 _ Failure to Fulfill Conditions. _ 

  

 In the event that Hampden determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify BHLB. 

  

    
 6.11 _ No Solicitation. _ 

  

  

 6.11.1 From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, neither Hampden, nor any Hampden Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and affiliates including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by Hampden or any of the Hampden Subsidiaries (collectively, 

  

      

  

"Representatives"), will, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information
or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
by Section 6.11.4), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or
negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an
Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, or employees or any of
its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by any of its Subsidiaries to
take any such action, and Hampden shall notify BHLB orally and in writing (as
promptly as practicable but no later than one business day of receipt of such
inquiry or proposal) of all of the relevant details relating to all inquiries
and proposals which Hampden or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees, or, to Hampden\'s
Knowledge, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or
other representatives of Hampden may receive relating to any of such matters;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of Hampden from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state law; or (ii) prior to the time
of the vote to approve this Agreement at the Hampden Stockholder Meeting,
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and
only to the extent that (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.11 by Hampden, and (B) the Board of Directors of
Hampden or any appropriate committee thereof has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with Hampden\'s financial advisor and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
transaction more favorable to Hampden stockholders from a financial point of
view than the Merger (taking into account all relevant factors, including,
without limitation, the timing of consummation as compared to the Merger and
the likelihood of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal) (such proposal
that satisfies clauses (A) and (B) being referred to herein as a
"Superior Proposal"); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit Hampden and, if applicable, any of its
Representatives from (i) informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 6.11, (ii) contacting any Person solely to clarify
the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) issuing a "stop-
look-and-listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) or taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iv) otherwise disclosing any
information to its stockholders that the Hampden Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that (i) it
is required to disclose to Hampden\'s stockholders under applicable law, or
(ii) for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, subject to compliance with the requirements of this Section
6.11 and Section 6.13. Hampden shall promptly, but in no event later than one
(1) calendar day, notify BHLB of such inquiries, proposals or offers received
by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with Hampden or any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or
offers, and receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in
form and substance identical in all material respects to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

 6.11.2 "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer as to any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder) involving Hampden or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Hampden or the filing of a registration statement under 

  

      

  

the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any public announcement
of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement
to engage in any of the foregoing.

  

 6.11.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the Hampden Stockholder Meeting, Hampden receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Hampden concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of Hampden determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would be required to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Hampden under applicable Laws, the Board of Directors of Hampden may enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement; _provided, however_ that such action may not occur until after (A) the third Business Day following BHLB\'s receipt of written notice from Hampden that the Board of Directors of Hampden is prepared to take such action (which notice will specify the material terms of the applicable Acquisition Proposal), and (B) at the end of such period, the Board of Directors of Hampden determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or revisions irrevocably committed to by BHLB and after consultation with Hampden\'s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal. During any such three Business Day period (the "Notice Period"), BHLB shall be entitled to deliver to Hampden one or more counterproposals to such Acquisition Proposal and Hampden will, and cause its Representatives to, negotiate with BHLB in good faith (to the extent BHLB desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the applicable Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

  

  

    
 6.12 _ Reserves and Merger-Related Costs. _ 

  

 Prior to the Effective Time, each of Hampden and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable U.S. banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of BHLB, _provided, however_ , that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.3; _provided further,_ that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Hampden or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Hampden or its management with any such adjustments. 

   

    
 6.13 _ Board of Directors and Committee Meetings. _ 

  

 Following the receipt of the Hampden Stockholder Approval and all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any waiting periods associated therewith), Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries shall permit two (2) representatives of BHLB to attend any meeting of their Board of Directors, executive committee, loan (or credit) committee and asset liability committee as observers (together, the "BHLB Observers"), provided that neither Hampden nor any Hampden Subsidiary shall be required to permit the BHLB Observers to remain present during any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal or during any other matter that the respective Board of Directors has been advised of by counsel that such attendance by the BHLB Observers may violate or be inconsistent with a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any legal, regulatory or Nasdaq requirement. 

        

    
 6.14 _ ESOP Loan. _ 

  

 In no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Hampden shall cause the Hampden ESOP trustee to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness of the Hampden ESOP, subject to the terms of the Hampden ESOP, by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Hampden Common Stock to Hampden, subject to and in accordance with applicable law. No later than the occurrence of the Effective Time, all remaining shares of Hampden Common Stock held by the Hampden ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Hampden ESOP account balances shall not be distributed to Hampden ESOP participants unless the Hampden ESOP has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS. Hampden and, following the Effective Time, BHLB, will adopt such amendments to the Hampden ESOP to effect the provisions of this Section 6.14. 

  

    
 6.15 _ Hampden Bank Charitable Foundation _ 

  

 Hampden agrees to recommend to the Board of Directors of the Hampden Bank Charitable Foundation ("Hampden Foundation") that the current Board of Directors of the Hampden Foundation resign as of the Closing and that the Hampden Foundation Board consist of BHLB representatives ("BHLB Foundation Representatives") as of Closing. Such BHLB Foundation Representatives shall be the same individuals that serve on the Board of Directors of the Berkshire Bank Foundation, Inc. In addition, Hampden agrees to recommend to the Hampden Foundation that Glenn Welch and Thomas Burton be appointed to the Board of Directors of the Hampden Foundation as of Closing. 

  

    
 6.16 _ 401(k) Plan Termination. _ 

   

 If requested by BHLB in writing prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, Hampden shall cause to be adopted prior to the Closing Date resolutions of the Board of Directors of Hampden and any necessary amendments to cease all contributions to any and all 401(k) plans maintained or sponsored by Hampden or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k) Plans"), and to prohibit the entry of new participants to the 401(k) Plans as of the day preceding the Closing Date, or to terminate the 401(k) Plans as of the day preceding the Closing Date. In the sole discretion of BHLB, the 401(k) Plans may be merged into the BHLB 401(k) Plan or terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of BHLB, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Hampden shall deliver to BHLB an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of Hampden and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. If, in accordance with this Section 6.16, BHLB requests in writing that Hampden freeze entry of new participants into the 401(k) Plans, or terminate the 401(k) Plans, Hampden shall take such actions as BHLB may reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption of the 401(k) Plans by BHLB, including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plans as may be necessary to effect such assumption or termination. 

  

    
ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS OF BHLB 

  

    7.1 _ Conduct of Business. _ 

  

  

 7.1.1 _ Affirmative Covenants._ 

    

 (A) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except with the written consent of Hampden, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, BHLB will, and it will cause each BHLB Subsidiary to: operate its business only in the usual, regular and ordinary course of business; use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises; 

   

      

   

and voluntarily take no action which would (i) change or waive any provision
of its certificate of incorporation (or articles or organization in the case
of Berkshire Bank) or bylaws in any way adverse to the rights of the Hampden
stockholders, except as required by law; (ii) materially adversely affect the
ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or
materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;
(iii) materially adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement; (iv) result in the representations and
warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct
on the date of this Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing
Date or in any of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not
being satisfied; (v) prevent or impede, or be reasonably likely to prevent or
impede, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

 (B) Promptly after the Closing and prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Exchange Fund. 

   

  

    
 7.2 _ Disclosure Supplements. _ 

   

 From time to time prior to the Effective Time, BHLB will promptly supplement or amend the BHLB Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such BHLB Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. 

   

    
 7.3 _ Consents and Approvals of Third Parties. _ 

  

 BHLB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each BHLB Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

    
 7.4 _ Reasonable Best Efforts. _ 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, BHLB agrees to use and agrees to cause each BHLB Subsidiary to use reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. 

   

    
 7.5 _ Employee Benefits. _ 

  

  

 7.5.1 _ Definition._ "Benefit Plan Determination Date" for purposes of this Section shall mean that date selected by BHLB and consented to by Hampden, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, with respect to each Hampden Benefit Plan to be maintained, frozen, terminated or replaced with a similar plan or program provided by BHLB or Berkshire Bank (as used in this Section, BHLB and Berkshire Bank are collectively referred to as "BHLB") to other employees similarly situated; provided, that, the definition of "Benefit Plan Determination Date" shall be consistent with the premise that the compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment that are provided by BHLB after the Closing Date to Continuing Hampden Employees shall be no less favorable than those provided by BHLB to similarly situated employees of BHLB. 

  

 7.5.2 _ General Rule: Parity in Benefits; No Gaps; Credit for Service with Hampden._ BHLB shall provide (or shall cause to be provided by a Subsidiary of BHLB) to all individuals who are employees of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary at the Closing Date and who remain so employed immediately following the Effective Time (the "Continuing Hampden Employees"), from and after the Closing Date, compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of 

  

      

  

employment, and within a reasonable period after the Closing Date, but not
before the applicable Benefit Plan Determination Date, employee benefits that
are, in each case, substantially similar to those provided by BHLB to
similarly situated employees of BHLB. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to
the contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall (i) operate to
duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Hampden Employees or the
funding of any such benefit, (ii) be construed to limit the ability of BHLB to
review employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements from time to time,
to make such changes as BHLB deems appropriate in its sole and absolute
discretion or to terminate such employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements provided that no such action not otherwise required by this
Agreement shall discriminate against Continuing Hampden Employees relative to
similarly situated employees of BHLB, (iii) create third party rights against
BHLB. BHLB will cause its insurance providers to waive all pre-existing
condition limitations and proof of insurability provisions (to the extent such
limitations and provisions did not apply to a pre-existing condition under
Hampden\'s equivalent plan) and eligibility waiting periods under such plans
that would otherwise be applicable to newly-hired employees for all Continuing
Hampden Employees; provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the
ability of BHLB to amend or enter into new or different employee benefit plans
or arrangements provided such plans or arrangements treat the Continuing
Hampden Employees in a substantially similar manner as employees of BHLB are
treated. BHLB will cause its insurance providers to honor under such plans
any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Continuing Hampden Employees and their covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year prior to the relevant Benefit Plan Determination Date. Under
all BHLB Benefit Plans, service with Hampden or a Hampden Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be service with BHLB for eligibility and vesting purposes only, but
not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan.

   

 7.5.3 _ BHLB 401(k) Plan Participation._ Each Continuing Hampden Employee shall be eligible to participate in BHLB\'s 401(k) plan on the day after the Benefit Plan Determination Date for the Hampden 401(k) Plans. All rights to participate in BHLB\'s 401(k) Plan are subject to BHLB\'s right to amend or terminate BHLB\'s 401(k) plan in its sole and absolute discretion and are subject to the terms of BHLB\'s 401(k) plan including, but not limited to, the eligibility and vesting provisions of such plan. 

  

 7.5.4 _ Employee Stock Ownership Plan._ BHLB agrees to take all such actions related to the Hampden ESOP as stated in Section 6.14 of this Agreement. 

  

 7.5.5 _ Welfare Benefits._ Each Continuing Hampden Employee who remains employed on the Benefit Plan Determination Date shall be eligible to participate in group hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare benefit plans and programs available to similarly-situated employees of BHLB, subject to the terms of such plans and programs, and subject to complying with eligibility requirements of the respective plans and programs. With respect to any welfare benefit plan or program of Hampden that BHLB determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding plan or program maintained by BHLB, BHLB shall, unless materially financially burdensome or resulting in an excise tax payable by BHLB under Code Section 4980D, continue such Hampden plan or program in effect for the benefit of the Continuing Hampden Employees until the later of the open enrollment period with respect to the year following the year in which the Merger occurs or each Continuing Hampden Employee becomes eligible to become participants in the corresponding benefit plan or program maintained by BHLB (and, with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying with eligibility requirements and subject to the right of BHLB to terminate or amend such plan or program) so that each Continuing Hampden Employee employed by BHLB has no gap in coverage under any hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability or other welfare plan or program. For purposes of all employee welfare benefit plans, programs and agreements maintained by or 

  

      

  

contributed to by BHLB, BHLB shall treat, and in the case of an insured plan,
shall cause the providers of each such plan, program or arrangement to treat
the service with Hampden prior to the Closing Date of any Continuing Hampden
Employee (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans,
programs or arrangements of Hampden prior to the Closing) as service rendered
to BHLB for all purposes; _provided, however_ , that such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such
benefit available to any Continuing Hampden Employee. Persons who were
employed by Hampden or any Affiliate and who were entitled to continue health
coverage under COBRA or any similar state law shall continue to be entitled
to COBRA coverage and coverage under similar state law under the Hampden
Benefit Plans that are health plans and, in the event of a termination of such
plans, BHLB shall continue to provide COBRA coverage.

  

 7.5.6 _ Paid Time Off Programs._ BHLB will give each Continuing Hampden Employee credit, for purposes of BHLB\'s vacation and/or other paid leave benefit programs, for such Continuing Hampden Employees\' accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance with Hampden as of the Closing Date. 

  

 7.5.7 _ BHLB to Honor Agreements._ Subject to any required regulatory approval or satisfaction of a condition in any Regulatory Approval, BHLB agrees to honor all employment agreements, change in control agreements, salary continuation agreements, split dollar agreements, severance agreements, deferred compensation agreements, consulting agreements and supplemental retirement plans that Hampden has with its current and former employees and current and former directors which have been identified in _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_, except to the extent any such agreements shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing Date or following the Closing Date with the written consent of the affected parties. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, BHLB shall provide an executive compensation proposal to each of the executives named in _Hampden Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_ whose agreements will be amended, revised or superseded, which shall set forth the method in which his or her rights under the specified agreements will be amended, revised or superseded in the event such individuals are entitled to payment or benefits. BHLB shall make the payments, or direct Hampden to make the payments, required under the agreements, as amended, revised or superseded. 

  

  

 Except for the agreements described in the preceding sentences of this Section 7.5.7 and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, subject to and following the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Hampden Benefit Plans shall, in the sole and absolute discretion of BHLB, be frozen, terminated or merged into comparable plans of BHLB, effective at such time as BHLB shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion. 

  

  

 7.5.8 _ No Guarantee of Employment._ Except to the extent of commitments herein or other contractual commitments, if any, specifically made or assumed by BHLB hereunder or by operation of law, BHLB shall have no obligation arising from and after the Closing Date to continue in its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any specified level of compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites to any Person who is an employee of Hampden as of the Closing Date. Each Person who is an employee of Hampden as of the Closing Date and who is terminated by BHLB for a reason other than cause within twelve (12) months subsequent to the Closing Date or is not offered employment with BHLB as of the Effective Time or resigns for good reason, excluding those employees who are entitled to benefits under change of control arrangements, shall be entitled to severance benefits pursuant to BHLB\'s current severance practice as described in _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 7.5.8_. 

  

 7.5.9 _ Offer of Employment._ BHLB will offer Messrs. Welch, Kettles and Ms. Corthell an officer level position with BHLB 

  

      

  

 7.5.10 _ Retention Pool._ BHLB shall establish a retention pool providing for retention bonuses to be paid to employees of Hampden prior to or following the Closing Date. 

  

 7.5.11 _ Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act._ If requested by BHLB, Hampden shall take all such actions as BHLB may request in order to fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN Act") and any state specific WARN Act statutes, including providing notices to Hampden\'s employees. 

  

  

    
 7.6 _ Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _ 

  

  

 7.6.1 Prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A coverage part (directors\' and officers\' liability) of Hampden\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies, and (ii) Hampden\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Hampden\'s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance" and such insurance carrier, the "Insurance Carrier") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as Hampden\'s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against any Person covered thereby that arose, existed, or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall BHLB be required to expend for such "tail" policy a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums paid by Hampden for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, Hampden agrees, in order for BHLB to fulfill its agreement, to provide the Insurance Carrier with such representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims. 

  

 7.6.2 In addition to Section 7.6.1, BHLB shall, from and after the Effective Date, to the fullest extent that would have been permitted to Hampden under DGCL and the Hampden Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (to the extent not prohibited by federal law), indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director of Hampden or any Hampden Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys\' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of BHLB, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each, a "Claim") in which an Indemnified Party is or is threatened to be made a party or witness in whole or in part or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was an Indemnified Party if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing, or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time and will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) as they are incurred in connection with any such Claim. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or advancement under this Section 7.6.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify BHLB (but the failure so to notify BHLB shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7.6.2, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices BHLB). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) BHLB shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such assumption BHLB shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any 

  

      

  

Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if BHLB
elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are or may be (whether
or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest
between BHLB and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and BHLB shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent
required due to conflicts of interest as described above, BHLB shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one (1) firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties unless there is a conflict of interest that
necessitates more than one law firm, and (3) BHLB shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

 7.6.3 In the event that either BHLB or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of BHLB shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6. 

   

 7.6.4 The obligations of BHLB provided under this Section 7.6 are intended to be enforceable against BHLB directly by any of the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of BHLB. 

  

  

    
 7.7 _ Stock Listing. _ 

  

 BHLB agrees to file a notification form for the listing on the NYSE (or such other national securities exchange on which the shares of BHLB Common Stock shall be listed as of the Closing Date) of the shares of BHLB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. 

  

    
 7.8 _ Reservation of Stock. _ 

  

 BHLB agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares of BHLB Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

    
 7.9 _ Communications to Hampden Employees; Training _ 

  

 BHLB and Hampden agree that as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, meetings with employees of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries shall be held at such locations as BHLB and Hampden shall mutually agree, provided that representatives of Hampden shall be permitted to attend such meetings. BHLB and Hampden shall mutually agree in advance as to the scope and content of all communications to the employees of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries. At mutually agreed upon times following execution of this Agreement, representatives of BHLB shall be permitted to meet with the employees of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries to discuss employment opportunities with BHLB, provided that representatives of Hampden shall be permitted to attend any such meeting. From and after the first date on which all Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) and the Hampden Stockholder Approval necessary for the consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger (disregarding any waiting period) have been obtained, BHLB shall also be permitted to conduct training sessions outside of normal business hours or at other times as Hampden may agree, with the employees of Hampden and the Hampden Subsidiaries and may conduct such training seminars at any branch location of Hampden Bank; provided that BHLB will in good faith attempt to schedule such training sessions in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with Hampden Bank\'s normal business operations. 

  

    
 7.10 _ Current Information. _ 

  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, BHLB will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives of Hampden to inform Hampden regarding 

        

BHLB\'s operations at such times as Hampden may reasonably request. BHLB will
promptly notify Hampden of any change in the ordinary course of its business
or in the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of material litigation involving BHLB or any BHLB

maybe, shall promptly inform the other parties thereof and shall cooperate
with such other parties in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC

Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to

any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the party responsible for
filing or mailing such document shall provide the other parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
discuss with the other parties and include in such document or response,
comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other parties. BHLB will
advise Hampden, promptly after BHLB receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of BHLB Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

  

 8.2.2 BHLB shall, as soon as practicable but in no event later than December 31, 2014, file the Merger Registration Statement with the SEC under the Securities Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. BHLB will advise Hampden promptly after BHLB receives notice of the time when the Merger Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the registration of the shares of BHLB Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement, or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Merger Registration Statement, or for additional information, and BHLB will provide Hampden with as many copies of such Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto promptly upon the filing thereof as Hampden may reasonably request.

In such event, Hampden shall cooperate with BHLB in the 

  

      

  

preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus
that corrects such misstatement or omission, and BHLB shall file an amended
Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and Hampden and BHLB shall mail
an amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to their respective stockholders.

  

  

    
 8.3 _ Regulatory Approvals. _
