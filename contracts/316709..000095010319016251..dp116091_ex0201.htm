Article 2 
 Closing; Merger

  



  

Section 2.01.   _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on
the third (3rd) Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in
Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waiver of such conditions by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit thereof, or at such other place, at such other time or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the date on which
the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

  



  

Section 2.02.   _The Merger_. (a) At the Closing, the Company shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Delaware
Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Law") in
connection

  



   

  

   

17

 



    

with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and is specified in the Certificate of Merger).

  



  

(b)  At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with
and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware Law, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  



  

(c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 2.03.   _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock:

  



  

  

(i) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to __Section 2.03(ii) (the "Excluded Shares"), shall be converted
into the right to receive 1.0837 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent
Common Stock (subject to the following proviso, the "Merger Consideration");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Merger Consideration issuable in respect
of shares of Company Common Stock that are Owned by TD Bank and its Affiliates
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any other shares
of Parent Common Stock then Owned by TD Bank and its Affiliates, would equal
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock exceeding the Maximum Percentage of
the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of immediately
following the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect
to the Parent Share Issuance), the Merger Consideration issuable to TD Bank
and its Affiliates will be (A) a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Maximum Percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock as of immediately following the Effective Time (and after
giving effect to this proviso) less the amount of any other shares of Parent
Common Stock then Owned by TD Bank and its Affiliates and (B) the remainder
of the Merger Consideration will be shares of Parent Nonvoting Common Stock.
For the avoidance of doubt, shares of Parent Common Stock held by Parent as
treasury stock or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent will not be
considered to be "issued and outstanding" for purposes of this
__Section 2.03(i). For purposes hereof, "Owned" means the ownership by a
Person of any securities as interpreted by the Federal Reserve Board under
the BHC Act or HOLA.

  



  

(ii)  each share of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company as treasury stock or by Parent (other than any
such shares held by Parent that are Fiduciary Shares) shall be cancelled, and
no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto;

  



  

(iii)  each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation; and

  



  

(iv)  all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and (x) each share of

  



    

18

 



    

Company Common Stock that was immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented by a certificate (each, a "Certificate") and (y) each
uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an "Uncertificated Share") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the
stock transfer books of the Company (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
__Section 2.04(f) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to  __Section 2.07, in each case to be issued or paid
in accordance with __Section 2.04, without interest.

  



  

Section 2.04.   _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") and enter into
an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent for the purpose of
exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 2.04 through the Exchange Agent, evidence of
shares in book-entry form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(i) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. Parent agrees to make available, directly or
indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional
cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.07. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent for use in such exchange. All evidence of shares in
book-entry form and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.04 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund."
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article 2 out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company
Common Stock are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f) or cash in lieu of
fractional interests to which holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.07. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent upon termination of
the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b)  Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (A) the
Merger Consideration and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto as
contemplated by Section 2.07 and Section 2.04(f)). The shares of Parent
Common Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is required
under Applicable Law.

  



    

19

 



    

(c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto contemplated by Section 2.07 or Section 2.04(f)) is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such transfer or similar Taxes
have been paid or are not payable.

  



  

(d)  Upon the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends and distributions with respect to the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.07 and Section 2.04(f))
with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as
otherwise contemplated by, this Article 2.

  



  

(e)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends and distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by Section
2.07 and Section 2.04(f)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance
with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)  Following the surrender of any Certificates or the transfer of any
Uncertificated Shares as provided in this Section 2.04, Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration have been
registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration,
(x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such
Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07, and (y) the aggregate amount of
all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time that
were paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the
amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration with a
record date on or after the Effective Time and prior to the time of such
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such
surrender or transfer. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration, and
no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.07, shall
be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any
Uncertificated

  



    

20

 



    

Shares not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.04.

  



  

(g)  The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred solely by a holder of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder.

  



  

Section 2.05.   _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Stock Option") whether vested or unvested shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of the Company, Parent or
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and become, as of the Effective
Time, an option (an "Assumed Stock Option") to purchase, on the same terms
and conditions (including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration
provisions) as applied to each such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shares of Parent Common Stock, except that (A) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Assumed Stock Option
shall equal the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, and (B) the per-share exercise price shall equal the
quotient of (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which
such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _divided_ by (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent; _provided_ that each Company Stock Option (A) which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
(B) shall be adjusted in a manner that complies with Section 409A of
the Code.

  



  

(b)   _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (other than the Company
Director Plan) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company RSU Award") whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without further action on the part of the Company, Parent or
the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and become, as of the Effective
Time, a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, an "Assumed RSU Award") on the same terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting provisions) as applied to each such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Assumed RSU Award shall equal
the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share.
Except as provided in this Section 2.05(b), each Assumed RSU Award shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c)   _Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is eligible to vest based on the
achievement of performance goals (each, a "Company PSU Award") shall by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent
or the holder thereof, be converted as of the Effective Time into a Parent
restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive shares of Parent

  



  

    

21

 



    

  

Common Stock with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company PSU Award (with the number of shares of Company Common Stock
earned to be determined based on the greater of (i) the actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance goals as determined by the
Compensation Committee prior to the Effective Time using the information
available as of the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the target level) (each, an "Assumed PSU Award"), except that the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Assumed PSU Award shall
equal the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were subject to such Company PSU Award (as determined in accordance with
this Section 2.05(c)) immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied
by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share. Except as
provided in this Section 2.05(c), each Assumed PSU Award shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company PSU Award (pursuant to the terms thereof following the
conversion of such Company PSU Award into a restricted stock unit award)
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Company Director Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time,
each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding under the Company Director Plan as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including each deferred restricted stock unit award and
each stock unit issued in respect of deferred cash fees (each, a "Company
Director RSU Award") whether vested or unvested, shall vest, if unvested, and
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.03, as if such Company Director RSU Award had
been settled in shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that each such Company Director RSU Award that
constitutes "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code
shall instead be settled at the earliest time that would not result in the
application of additional Taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code,
and each Company Director RSU Award for which settlement is delayed shall be
converted into a fully vested Assumed RSU Award in the manner described in
Section 2.05(b).

  



  

(e)   _Reservation of Shares_. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing
Date), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the issuance of the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options, the
Assumed RSU Awards and the Assumed PSU Awards and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed Stock Options,
Assumed RSU Awards and Assumed PSU Awards remain outstanding.

  



  

(f)   _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company (and/or the H.R. and Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company) and the Board of Directors of Parent (and/or the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent) shall adopt such
resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05.

  



  

Section 2.06.   _Adjustments_. Without limiting or affecting any of the
provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, if, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse
stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares,
subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with
a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable

  



    

22

 



    



  

pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the
effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.07.   _Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and, if a fractional
share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to
receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by
multiplying the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled by the closing price of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 2.08.   _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, so withholds and pays over all amounts so withheld to the
appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under Applicable Law,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding. The Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or
withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under
Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.09.   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
customary bond issued for lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates, in
such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.10.   _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Article 3 
 Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers

  



  

Section 3.01.   _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety as set forth on
_Exhibit A_. From and after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until

  



   

  

   

23

 



    

thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law. The bylaws of

Section 6.02.   _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Upon
reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, to all of its properties, books, contracts and records,
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent all other information concerning
its businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request,
and instruct its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in its
investigation. All information furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of January 18, 2019,
between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company or Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.02, Section
8.01 or Section 8.02, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to its properties, books, contracts, records or

access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Applicable Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which such restrictions apply (including redacting such information (i) to
remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements in effect on or after the date hereof, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
Parent have access to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other similar information that in the reasonable opinion of the
Company the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability.

  



  

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation by the Company_. (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 6.03, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants and other agents, advisors and
representatives (including, in the case of the Company, the Company Special
Committee) (collectively, "Representatives"), not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage the submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company

knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or knowingly encourage any
effort by, any Third Party that the Company knows, or should reasonably be
expected to know, is seeking to make, or has made, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) (A) fail to make, or withdraw or

  



    

65

 



    

qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation (it being understood that any failure to publicly, and without
qualification (x) recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal and (y)
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10)
Business Days after a Company Acquisition Proposal is made public or
any request by Parent to do so will be treated as a withdrawal of the Company
Board Recommendation for purposes hereof), (B) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (C) recommend,
adopt or approve or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve any
Company Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) take any action to make any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority,"
"affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or
other similar anti-takeover laws and regulations of the State of Delaware,
including Section 203 of the Delaware Law, inapplicable to any Third Party or
any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (v) fail to enforce, or grant any waiver
or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Approval Time") (and in no
event after the Company Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company
receives a  _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the
date hereof which has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.03, the
Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section
6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e), (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement an
unsolicited  _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party and its
Representatives and financing sources nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after
its execution, to Parent for informational purposes; _provided_ that all such
non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party, and (iii)
following receipt of a Company Superior Proposal after the date of this
Agreement, make (at the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Securities Exchange Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, so
long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 6.03; or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
Applicable Law; _provided_ that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal may only be made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and
Section 6.03(e) and even if permitted by this sentence, shall have the
consequences set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a
"stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Securities Exchange Act shall not be
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

  



    

66

 



    

(c)  In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.03(b), the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have
first delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company
intends to take such action, and the Company shall continue to advise Parent,
on a current basis, after taking such action of the status and material
terms of any discussions and negotiations with the applicable Third Party. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a
Third Party is considering making a Company Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge
of the Company or any member of its Board of Directors, is considering making,
is reasonably likely to make or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the relevant
Third Party and, to the extent known, the material terms and conditions of,
any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any
material changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis, of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto) and shall
promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and written materials
sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any
terms or conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal (as well as written
summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Company Approval Time (and in no event after the Company
Approval Time), the Board of Directors of the Company (at the recommendation
of the Company Special Committee) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) the Company shall (A) promptly notify
Parent in writing of its intention to take such action and (B) negotiate in
good faith with Parent for five (5) Business Days following such notice
regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and
(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening
Event unless, after the five (5) Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (B), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  Without limiting or affecting Section 6.03(a), Section 6.03(b) or
Section 6.03(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a
Company Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing at least five (5) Business Days before taking such action, that the
Company intends to take such action, which notice attaches the most current
version of any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms
of such Company Superior Proposal and the identity of the offeror, (ii) if
requested by Parent, during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company
and its Representatives have discussed and negotiated in good faith with
Parent regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement
in response to such Company Superior Proposal and (iii) after such five (5)
Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in the event of
any

  



    

67

 



    

amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any such Company
Superior Proposal, a new written notification from the Company consistent with
that described in clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall be required and a
new notice period under clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall commence,
during which notice period the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.03(e) anew, except that such new notice period
shall be for three (3) Business Days (as opposed to five (5) Business
Days)). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly keep Parent informed of all
material developments affecting the material terms of any such Company
Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received that relate to such Company Superior
Proposal).

  



  

(f)  "Company Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ , written Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Company Acquisition Proposal which has
resulted from a violation of this Section 6.03) (with all references to "15%"
in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal being deemed to be
references to "50%" and clauses (ii)(2), (iii)(2) and (iv)(B)(2) being
disregarded) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
considers to be appropriate (including the identity of the Person making the
Company Acquisition Proposal and the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements (including
divestitures and entry into other commitments and limitations), break-
up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and
availability of necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i) that,
if consummated, is more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view (taking into account, among other items, the tax
attributes of such transaction) than the Merger (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account the identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal,
any approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Company Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors
of the Company.

  



  

(g)  "Company Intervening Event" means any material event, change, effect,
development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case
to the Board of Directors or executive officers of the Company as of or prior
to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided _ that (A) in no event shall any
action taken by either party pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth
in Section 8.01, or the consequences of any such action, constitute, be
deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Intervening Event, and (B) in no
event shall any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would
fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken
into account in determining whether there has been a Company Intervening
Event.

  



  

(h)  The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such information.

  



  

  



    

68

 



    

(i)  Notwithstanding (i) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the
making of any Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement (x) in no event
may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar instrument constituting or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section
6.03(b)), (B) except as required by Applicable Law, make, facilitate or
provide information in connection with any SEC or other Filings in connection
with the transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition Proposal or (C)
seek any Consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company shall otherwise remain
subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the obligation to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 6.04.   _Transition_. (a) In order to facilitate the integration and
the operations of the Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
and to permit the coordination of their related operations on a timely basis
after the Effective Time, and in an effort to accelerate to the earliest time
possible after the Effective Time the realization of synergies, operating
efficiencies and other benefits expected to be realized as a result of the
Merger, upon Parent's request, the parties shall establish a transition
planning team of at least six members (the "Transition Team") comprised of an
equal number of representatives of Parent and the Company, which shall be
responsible for facilitating a transition and integration planning process to
ensure the successful combination of the operations of Parent and the Company.
Upon Parent's request, subject to Applicable Law, the Transition Team shall
be responsible for developing and implementing a detailed action plan for the
combination of the businesses from and after the Effective Time and shall (i)
confer on a regular and continued basis regarding the status of
the transition and integration planning process, (ii) communicate and consult
with its members with respect to the manner in which the respective
businesses will be conducted from and after the Effective Time and (iii)
coordinate human resources integration.

  



  

(b)  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, (i) (A) Parent
may implement retention and/or incentive programs for certain employees of
Parent and of Company (which programs, for the avoidance of doubt, may be
implemented in Parent's sole discretion), under which programs employees of
the Company will be considered for participation based on substantially
the same factors and in substantially the same manner as similarly situated
employees of Parent and (B) at the reasonable request of Parent, the Company
shall cooperate in good faith with Parent to establish and implement Company-
sponsored employee retention and transition incentive programs designed to
encourage the retention and performance of employees and groups of employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are mutually identified by the
Company and Parent, and (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, coordinate with Parent with respect to the formulation and
dissemination of internal and external communications and announcements
relating to the impact on employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of the
Merger and the integration of the operations of the Company with those of
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
adoption of a retention and transition incentive program described above in
this Section 6.04(b) pursuant to the mutual written agreement of the Company
and Parent, and the obligations and liabilities relating to such agreed
program, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the completeness,
truthfulness and accuracy of the representations of the Company set forth in
Article 4 and for purposes of determining the Company's compliance with its
covenants under Section 6.01.

  



  

Section 6.05.   _Indenture_.

  



  

  



    

69

 



    

(a)  The Company shall timely provide or cause to be provided, in accordance
with the provisions of the Company's indenture, dated October 22, 2014 (as
supplemented, the "Indenture"), as supplemented by the supplemental indentures
related thereto, relating to the Company's Floating Rate Senior Notes due
November 2021, 2.95% Senior Notes due April 2022, 3.75% Senior Notes due
April 2024, 3.625% Senior Notes due April 2025, 3.30% Senior Notes due April
2027 and 2.750% Senior Notes due October 2029, to the trustee under the
Indenture, any certificates or legal opinions (to the extent
such certificates and opinions would not conflict with Applicable Laws and
would be accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time
delivered) required by the Indenture to be provided in connection with the
Merger prior to the Effective Time. Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such certificate before
such document is provided to such trustee.

  



  

(b)  If Parent so elects, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, at Parent's expense, to cause the Indenture to be amended, in a
manner and form reasonably acceptable to Parent, effective as of to the
Closing Date and subject to the consummation of the Closing, to provide that,
with respect to any notes covered by the Indenture, the Company or its
applicable Subsidiaries shall not redeem such notes prior to the six (6)
month anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.06.   _Advisory Client Consents_.

  



  

(a)   _Negative Consents; Affirmative Consents_. Each RIA Subsidiary shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, in accordance with Applicable Law
and the applicable Advisory Agreement, the consent of each Advisory Client to
the deemed assignment of its Advisory Agreement as a result of the
Transactions prior to Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each RIA Subsidiary shall send, within 30 days of the date hereof,
notices complying with all Applicable Laws and applicable Advisory Agreements
(each, a "Client Negative Consent Letter"), to each Person that is an Advisory
Client as of the date hereof (i) informing such Advisory Client of the
Transactions, (ii) informing such Advisory Client that such RIA
Subsidiary intends to continue to provide Investment Advisory Services to
such Advisory Client after Closing and requesting such Advisory Client's
consent thereto and (iii) containing any other information required by
Applicable Law or any Self-Regulatory Organization or the applicable Advisory
Agreements. Parent and the Company agree that the consent and approval of each
Advisory Client with respect to its Advisory Agreement sought under this
Section 6.06(a) shall be deemed given by such Advisory Client for all
purposes under this Agreement upon the earlier of (A) receipt of such Advisory
Client's affirmative written consent or approval in response to the Client
Negative Consent Letter and (B) except in the case of Affirmative Consent
Clients, the 60th day after the respective RIA Subsidiary sent to such
Advisory Client a Client Negative Consent Letter, in each case under the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (I) so as to permit the respective RIA
Subsidiary, in accordance with Applicable Law and the applicable Contracts,
to continue to provide Investment Advisory Services on substantially the same
terms and conditions as in effect on the date hereof, to such Advisory Client
following the Closing, (II) provided such Advisory Client has not, prior
to Closing, terminated its Advisory Agreement (including the assignment,
transfer or conversion thereof to a Third Party), notified the respective RIA
Subsidiary that it objects to the Transactions or intends to so terminate its
Advisory Agreement, or revoked its consent, and (III) provided, if such
Advisory Client has not provided affirmative written consent or approval
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Client Negative Consent Letter,
the respective RIA Subsidiary has sent a second Client Negative Consent
Letter to such Advisory Client. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in the event
that the affirmative written consent of any Advisory Client is required under
Applicable Law or Advisory Agreement in connection with the Transactions
(including the deemed assignment of the Client's Advisory Agreement in
accordance with

  



   

70

 



    

clause (I) above) (any such Client, an "Affirmative Consent Client"), then
the respective RIA Subsidiary, with the cooperation of Parent, shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain such affirmative written consent prior to
Closing. Parent and each RIA Subsidiary agree that a New Client shall be
deemed to have provided the consent contemplated by this Section 6.06(a) if
(i) the consent (or, as applicable, deemed consent) of such New Client to the
Transactions has been obtained in accordance with this Section 6.06(a) or
(ii) the respective RIA Subsidiary has disclosed in writing, in accordance
with Applicable Law, the Transactions to such New Client before such New
Client became an Advisory Client and, in any case under the foregoing clauses
(i) or (ii), such New Client has not, prior to Closing, terminated its
Advisory Agreement (including the assignment, transfer or conversion
thereof to a Third Party), notified the respective RIA Subsidiary that it
objects to the Transactions or intends to so terminate its
Advisory Agreement, or revoked its consent. Parent shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all materials used to seek Advisory
Client consents, or disclose the Transactions to New Clients, for purposes of
this Section 6.06(a) prior to distribution. The Company agrees to cause RIA
Subsidiaries to cooperate with and support its efforts under this
Section 6.06(a).

  



  

(b)   _Cooperation_. Parent shall (i) reasonably cooperate with and assist
the Company and the RIA Subsidiaries in connection with obtaining the
approvals and consents sought pursuant to this Section 6.06 and (ii) promptly
provide to each RIA Subsidiary in writing all information concerning Parent
and its Affiliates as is required under Applicable Law, reasonably
required or otherwise reasonably requested in order for such RIA Subsidiary
to seek to obtain the approvals and consents to be sought pursuant to this
Section 6.06. Each Party shall cause all information relating to such Party
and its Affiliates supplied by it for inclusion in such requests for
approvals and consents, at the time of the mailing or delivery of such
requests for approvals and consents or supplemental communications related
thereto, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

Section 6.07.   _Termination of Related Party Contracts_. Except with
respect to the Excluded Arrangements, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all actions within
its control to terminate all Contracts between or among the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Related Party, on the other hand,
including the Contracts listed on Section 6.07(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule but excluding the Contracts listed on Section 6.07(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, in each case, without any continuing liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder;  _provided_ , that, prior to
terminating any Contract not listed on Section 6.07(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company will notify Parent and Parent may elect for
such Contract to remain in effect.

  



  

Article 7 
 Covenants of Parent

the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required or expressly
permitted by this Agreement, unless the Company shall otherwise consent (which

shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,

    

71

 



    



  

conduct its business in compliance in all material respects with all
Applicable Laws and shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not

extent it would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, enjoin, alter or
materially delay the Transactions;

  



 

  



  

(b)  adopt or propose any change to the Parent Organizational Documents in a
manner that would be materially adverse to the Company's stockholders
(whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise);

by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets) any interest in

or otherwise dispose of any Subsidiary or any division thereof or of Parent or
any assets, securities or property, in each case in this clause (c) that,
individually or in the aggregate, would, or would reasonably be expected to,
prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the Transactions;

cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (including with respect to record and payment dates) in an amount
not to exceed (1) for the fourth quarter of 2019, $0.17 and (2) for subsequent

combinations or other similar events relating to Parent Common Stock), or (B)

Section 7.02.   _No Solicitation by Parent_. (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 7.02, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and
its Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage the submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any

Party that Parent knows, or should reasonably be expected to know, is seeking
to make, or has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii)

  



    

72

 



    

(A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse
to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation (it being understood that any
failure to publicly, and without qualification (x) recommend against any
Parent Acquisition Proposal and (y) reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation,
in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after a Parent
Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by the Company to do so
will be treated as a withdrawal of the Parent Board Recommendation for
purposes hereof), (B) fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or
publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve any Parent Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), a "Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change"), (iv) take any action to make any "moratorium,"

transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or other
similar anti-takeover laws and regulations of the State of Delaware, including
Section 203 of the Delaware Law, inapplicable to any Third Party or any
Parent Acquisition Proposal or (v) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of
the Parent Stockholder Approval (the "Parent Approval Time") (and in no event
after the Parent Approval Time), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a
_bona fide_ written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof
which has not resulted from a violation of this Section 7.02, the Board of
Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section 7.02(b),
Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.02(e), (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to Parent's compliance with
Section 7.02(a), has made after the date of this Agreement an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party and its
Representatives and financing sources nonpublic information relating to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms
no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after its execution,
to the Company for informational purposes; _provided_ that all such non-
public information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to the Company) is provided or made
available to the Company, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party, and (iii)
following receipt of a Parent Superior Proposal after the date of this
Agreement, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with Parent's
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of Parent from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Securities Exchange Act with regard to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, so long
as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 7.02; or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of
Parent if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law;
_provided_ that any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or
relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 7.02(b), Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.02(e)
and even if permitted by this sentence, shall have the consequences set forth
in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act shall not be a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change.

  



  

  



    

73

 



    

(c)  In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 7.02(b), the Board
of Directors of Parent shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 7.02(b) unless Parent shall have first
delivered to the Company written notice advising the Company that Parent
intends to take such action, and Parent shall continue to advise the Company,
on a current basis, after taking such action of the status and material terms
of any discussions and negotiations with the applicable Third Party. In
addition, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Parent (or any of its
Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a
Third Party is considering making a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of Parent or
any member of its Board of Directors, is considering making, is reasonably
likely to make or has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
be provided in writing and shall identify the relevant Third Party and, to the
extent known, the material terms and conditions of, any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any material
changes thereto). Parent shall keep the Company fully informed, on a current
basis, of the status and details of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request (including any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but
in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) provide to the
Company copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or
provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal (as well as written
summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Parent Approval Time (and in no event after the Parent Approval
Time), the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) Parent shall (A) promptly notify the
Company in writing of its intention to take such action and (B) negotiate in
good faith with the Company for five (5) Business Days following such notice
regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and
(ii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event
unless, after the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (B), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  Without limiting or affecting Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or
Section 7.02(c), the Board of Directors of Parent shall not make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent
Superior Proposal unless (i) Parent promptly notifies the Company, in writing
at least five (5) Business Days before taking such action, that Parent
intends to take such action, which notice attaches the most current version of
any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of such
Parent Superior Proposal and the identity of the offeror, (ii) if requested by
the Company, during such five (5) Business Day period, Parent and its
Representatives have discussed and negotiated in good faith with the Company
regarding any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement in
response to such Parent Superior Proposal and (iii) after such five (5)
Business Day period, the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, taking into account any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of
this Agreement, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that in
the event of any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
any such Parent Superior Proposal, a new written notification from Parent

  



    

74

 



    

consistent with that described in clause (i) of this Section 7.02(e) shall be
required and a new notice period under clause (i) of this Section 7.02(e)
shall commence, during which notice period Parent shall be required to comply
with the requirements of this Section 7.02(e) anew, except that such new
notice period shall be for three (3) Business Days (as opposed to five (5)
Business Days)). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall promptly keep the Company
informed of all material developments affecting the material terms of any
such Parent Superior Proposal (and Parent shall provide the Company with
copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such Parent
Superior Proposal).

  



  

(f)  "Parent Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ , written Parent
Acquisition Proposal (other than a Parent Acquisition Proposal which has
resulted from a violation of this Section 7.02) (with all references to
"15%" in the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal being deemed to be
references to "50%" and clauses (ii)(2), (iii)(2) and (iv)(B)(2) being
disregarded) on terms that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Parent
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent considers to be
appropriate (including the identity of the Person making the
Parent Acquisition Proposal and the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements
(including divestitures and entry into other commitments and limitations),
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation
and availability of necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i)
that, if consummated, is more favorable to Parent's stockholders from a
financial point of view (taking into account, among other items, the tax
attributes of such transaction) than the Merger (taking into account any
proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account the identity of the Person making the Parent Acquisition Proposal,
any approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such Parent Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for which financing, if
a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or
reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of Parent.

  



  

(g)  "Parent Intervening Event" means any material event, change, effect,
development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case
to the Board of Directors or executive officers of Parent as of or prior to
the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (A) in no event shall any action taken
by either party pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth in
Section 8.01, or the consequences of any such action, constitute, be deemed
to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a Parent Intervening Event, and (B) in no event shall any
event, change, effect, development or occurrence that would fall within any
of the exceptions to the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect"
constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event.

  



  

(h)  Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries its and its
Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of confidential information about Parent that was furnished by or
on behalf of Parent to return or destroy all such information.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding (i) any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the
making of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, until termination of this

  



    

75

 



    

Agreement (x) in no event may Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar instrument constituting or relating to
a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with Section 7.02(b)), (B) except as required by Applicable Law,
make, facilitate or provide information in connection with any SEC or other
Filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Parent Acquisition Proposal or (C) seek any Consents in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Parent Acquisition Proposal and (y) Parent
shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this
Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to hold
the Parent Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 7.03.   _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Until the Effective Time,
Parent shall at all times be the direct or indirect owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall cause the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver a
written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with the Delaware Law
and provide a copy of such written consent to the Company, and thereafter
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall amend, modify or withdraw
such consent.

  



  

Section 7.04. _Director and Officer Liability_. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each
case to the extent (subject to Applicable Law) such Persons are indemnified
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company
Organizational Documents, the governing or organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company and any indemnification agreements in existence as
of the date hereof and disclosed in Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether
arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of advancement of expenses,
any Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b)  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided,
however,_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on
an aggregate basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "Premium
Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap or such coverage is not otherwise available, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parent's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an aggregate premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or

  



    

76

 



    



  

the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent, may
(and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail"
policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this Section 7.04 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in
each such case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.04.

  



  

Section 7.05.   _Employee Matters_. (a) From the Closing Date through the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Benefits Continuation Period"),
the Surviving Corporation shall provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to the individuals who are employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and to the
extent they continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of Parent's Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of the Surviving
Corporation) during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the
"Affected Employees") (i) a base salary or base wage rate that is no less
favorable than those provided to the Affected Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) other compensation (including bonus and other annual
or quarterly cash incentive compensation opportunities) that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than that provided to the Affected Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) employee benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent as in effect from time to time;
_provided_ that, for purposes of each of the foregoing, defined
benefit pension plan benefits, retiree medical benefits and retention or
change in control payments or awards shall not be taken into account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Affected Employees who are involuntarily
terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period shall be entitled to
receive the severance payments and benefits set forth in Section 7.05(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to the Affected Employee signing and
not revoking a release of claims in favor of Parent.

  



  

(b)  In the event any Affected Employee first becomes eligible to
participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan") following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any Parent Plan
providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the applicable Company
Employee Plan such Affected Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under such Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Affected Employee with
credit for any copayments and deductibles paid under a Company Employee Plan
prior to such Affected Employee's coverage under any Parent Plan during the
calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit
was given under the Company Employee Plan such Affected Employee participated
in immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Plan in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan.

  



  

(c)  As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, recognize all service of each Affected Employee prior to the Effective
Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and

  



  

    

   

77

 



    

their respective predecessors for vesting and eligibility purposes under all
applicable compensation and benefit plans and programs (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except under all applicable paid time off (other than any
Parent employee sabbatical program) and severance plans and programs, as
applicable). In no event shall anything contained in this Section 7.05(c)
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  



  

(d)  Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, pursuant to resolutions of the
Company's Board of Directors that are reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In
connection with the termination of such plans, Parent shall permit each
Affected Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Affected Employee
from such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and shall make
Affected Employees eligible for participation in such a plan of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries as of immediately after the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)  Nothing contained in this Section 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to
be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any Affected
Employees, for any period of time following the Effective Time, (ii) shall
prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any
Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy
in effect from time to time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any
Company Employee Plan or Parent Plan, or (iv) shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or individual Person,
including any present or former employee, officer, director or individual
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
any beneficiary or dependent of such individual), except as provided in
Section 7.04.

  



  

Article 8 
 Covenants of Parent and the Company

  



  

The parties hereto agree that:

  



  

Section 8.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case, such different
standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions
(including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all
necessary Filings (including Filings pursuant to the HSR Act and Filings that
may be required by TD Bank in order to be permitted to receive the Merger
Consideration) (and, absent the prior written consent of the other party, not
withdrawing any such Filings) and resubmitting any such Filings as soon as is
reasonably practicable in the event such filings are rejected for any reason
whatsoever by the relevant Governmental Authority and (ii) using reasonable
best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, in which case, such different standard shall
apply) to obtain all Consents required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
Company and Parent shall deliver as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental

   



  

   

78

 



    

Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Company or Parent or their
respective controlled Affiliates shall extend any waiting period or comparable
period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transactions,
except with the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(b)  Each of the Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law (i) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication made or received by the Company or Parent, as applicable, with
any Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust Law (or any other Filings
made pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) and regarding this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and, if
permitted by Applicable Law and reasonably practical, permit the other party
to review in advance any proposed written communication to any such
Governmental Authority and incorporate such other party's (and any of their
respective outside counsel's) reasonable comments to such proposed written
communication, (ii) not agree to participate in any in-person meeting or
substantive discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
Filing, investigation or inquiry relating to Antitrust Law (or any other
Filings made pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) and regarding this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or any of the Transactions unless, to the extent
reasonably practicable, it consults with such other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives such other
party the opportunity to attend or participate, as applicable, and (iii)
promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and written communications between it and its Affiliates and Representatives,
on the one hand, and such Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
the Transactions. Any materials exchanged in connection with this Section
8.01 may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege
or confidentiality concerns, and to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company or other competitively sensitive material; _provided_ , that
the parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials
provided to the other under this Section 8.01 as "outside counsel only."

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than Section 8.01(d), and in furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts to resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Merger to occur as soon as
possible but no later than the End Date; _provided _ that Parent, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall not be required under any provision of this
Agreement to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition, or
license of any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses
of Parent, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any interest therein, or agree to any other structural
or conduct remedy, (ii) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that
would limit Parent's, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain any assets, properties, products, rights, services or
businesses of Parent, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any interest or interests therein;
(iii) take any action that would result in Parent either (A) being deemed to
be "controlled" by TD Bank as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve
Board under the BHC Act or HOLA or (B) being deemed to be in "control" of any
of the TD Subsidiary Banks as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve
Board under the BHC Act or HOLA, (iv) agree to any modification to the Amended
and Restated IDA Agreement, other than any modifications that would solely
reduce the amount of deposits swept to TD Subsidiary Banks thereunder

  



    

79

 



    

or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case of clauses (i), (ii)
and (v) (as it applies to clauses (i) and (ii)), if such action would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case
measured on a scale relative to the size of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any of the actions described in this
proviso, other than proposing or negotiating (but not committing to or
effecting) the actions as set forth in clause (i) of this proviso, a
"Burdensome Condition"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the written request
of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, agree to
take any action that would constitute a Burdensome Condition so long as such
action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

  



  

(d)  In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other
Third Party is commenced which questions the validity or legality of, or
otherwise challenges, the Transactions, or seeks damages in connection

any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be

taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper
or advisable on its part to cause the Company Stockholder Approval to be
received at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and shall comply with all legal requirements applicable
to the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the
Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under Applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder

advisable on its part to cause the Parent Stockholder Approval to be received

and shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Parent
Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Parent Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may postpone or adjourn the

and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Parent Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
necessary under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Parent's stockholders prior to

to this Section 8.03(b).

  



  

(c)  Each of the Company and Parent shall coordinate with the other
regarding the record date and the meeting date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, it being the intention of the
Company and Parent that the record date and meeting date for each such
meeting of stockholders shall be the same.

representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a failure to comply with this
Section 8.05 shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in

independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article 9 to
be satisfied.

  



  

Section 8.06.   _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common

calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Company Common Stock, on the
one hand, and shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common Stock
receives pursuant to the Merger, on the other.

  



  

Section 8.10.   _Governance Matters_. (a) To the extent that such director
representation is consistent with receipt of the Noncontrol Determinations,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Board of Directors of Parent to, take all
necessary action to cause (i) one individual designated by the Company

  



    

85

 



    



  

(the "Company New Board Designee") and (ii) two individuals designated by TD
Bank (each, a "TD New Board Designee" and, together with the Company New Board
Designee, the "New Board Designees")) to be appointed to the Board of
Directors of Parent as of the Effective Time, including, to the extent
necessary, by increasing the size of the Board of Directors of Parent and
appointing the New Board Designees to fill the resulting vacancies. Subject

(b) Each of the New Board Designees shall meet (i) the director

any applicable requirements or standards that may be imposed by a Regulatory

after consultation in good faith with the Company or TD Bank, as applicable,
that any New Board Designee designated by such Person does not meet the
Eligibility Criteria or any New Board Designee is unwilling or unable to serve
on the Board of Directors of Parent commencing on the Closing Date, the
Company or TD Bank, as applicable, may propose another individual as a New
Board Designee, who must satisfy the Eligibility Criteria. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date hereof, it does not know of any
reason why the New Board Designees set forth in Section 8.10(a) would not
satisfy the Eligibility Criteria as in effect as of the date hereof.

  



  

(c)  At the direction of Parent, (i) one New Board Designee selected by
Parent shall be assigned to the class of directors whose term expires at the
first annual meeting of Parent's stockholders that occurs after the Effective

"control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority,"
"affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or
other similar state anti-takeover laws or regulations, or any similar
provision of the Company Organizational Documents or the Parent Organizational
Documents, as applicable, is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) if any such anti-takeover
law, regulation or provision is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, cooperate and grant such approvals

Parent, in each case, as shall be reasonably requested in connection with any
tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
that may be contained or set forth in the Registration Statement or
delivered to a party in connection with the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
(i) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code with respect to which Parent and the Company
will each be a "party to the reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code and (ii) not to, and not permit or cause any of its
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, take or cause to be taken any action
reasonably likely to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Company intend to report the Merger for U.S. federal tax
purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of either thereof shall have any
liability or obligation to any holder of Company Common Stock should the
Merger fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

expenses of counsel, accountants, investment banking firms and other
financial advisors, experts and consultants) actually incurred or accrued in
connection with or related to the Transactions (the "Company Expense

be required to pay either the Company Termination Fee or the Company Expense
Reimbursement on more than one occasion and in no event shall Parent be
required to pay either the Parent Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement on more than one occasion (but, for the avoidance of doubt, (1)
subject to the last sentence of Section 10.03(c), the Company may be required
to pay both the Company Termination Fee and the Company Expense Reimbursement
and (2) subject to the last sentence of Section 10.03(d),

  



    

93

 



    

Parent may be required to pay both the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent
Expense Reimbursement), and (y) in no event shall Parent be entitled,
pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than an amount
equal to (x) the Company Termination Fee _plus_ (z) any Collection Expenses,
and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this
Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Parent Termination Fee
_plus_ any Collection Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, (i) if Parent receives the
Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 10.03 or if
the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to
this Section 10.03, such payment (together with any Collection Expenses)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the
paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or
future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and
Representatives and none of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders,
managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, and (ii) if (A) Parent or Merger Sub receive any payments from
the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent
receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03 or (B)
the Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger Sub in respect of
any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, the amount of such Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by
the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of any
such breaches. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not constitute a penalty.
Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled
to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to
promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this
Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the
date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment (such
interest, together with costs and expenses of enforcement as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, "Collection Expenses").

AMENDMENT TO 
 FIFTH RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF 
 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION 
 (Effective [●])

  



  

(Originally incorporated on November 25, 1986, 
 under the name CL Acquisition Corporation)

  



  

It is hereby certified that

  



  

First. The name of this corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation")
is THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION.

  



  

Second. The Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is
hereby amended by striking out Article FOURTH thereof and restating it in its
entirety as follows:

  



  

"FOURTH.

  

  



  

  

(A) This Corporation is authorized to issue three classes of stock:
preferred stock, common stock and nonvoting common stock. The authorized
number of shares of capital stock is Three Billion, Three Hundred Nine
Million, Nine Hundred Forty Thousand (3,309,940,000) shares, of which the
authorized number of shares of preferred stock is Nine Million, Nine Hundred
Forty Thousand (9,940,000), the authorized number of shares of common stock
is Three Billion (3,000,000,000) and the authorized number of shares of
nonvoting common stock is Three Hundred Million (300,000,000). As used in
this Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, references to "common
stock" refer to the class of voting shares of common stock, references to
"Nonvoting common stock" refer to the class of nonvoting common stock, and
the class of common stock together with the class of Nonvoting common
stock are collectively referred to as the "Common Shares." The stock, whether
preferred stock, common stock or Nonvoting common stock, shall have a par
value of one cent ($0.01) per share. The number of authorized shares of any
class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares of such class then outstanding plus the number of shares of
such class reserved for issuance, including shares reserved for issuance upon
the conversion or exercise of any security of the Corporation providing for
the issuance or delivery of shares of such class upon the conversion or
exercise thereof) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
common stock.

  



  

  

(B)   _Common Shares_.

  



  

(1)   _Dividends and Other Distributions_. Subject to the preferences
applicable to any series of preferred stock, if any, outstanding at any time,
and subject to the proviso in the following sentence, the holders of Common
Shares shall share equally and be treated identically, on a per share basis,
in dividends and other distributions of cash, property or shares of stock
of the Corporation as may be declared by the Board of Directors from time to
time with respect to the Common Shares out of assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor, including, without limitation, in
respect of related declaration dates, record dates and payment dates. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, no dividend may be
declared or paid with respect to shares of common stock unless an identical
per share dividend is simultaneously

  



  

   



 

    

declared and paid in respect of shares of Nonvoting common stock, and no
dividend may be declared or paid with respect to shares of Nonvoting common
stock unless an identical per share dividend is simultaneously declared and
paid in respect of shares of common stock;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that any dividend is paid in the form of Common Shares or rights to
acquire Common Shares, the holders of common stock shall receive common stock
or rights to acquire common stock, as the case may be, and the holders of
Nonvoting common stock shall receive Nonvoting common stock or rights to
acquire Nonvoting common stock, as the case may be.

  



  

(2)   _Voting Rights_.

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designations, all of the
voting power of the Corporation shall be vested in the holders of common
stock, and each holder of common stock shall have one vote for each share of
common stock held by such holder on all matters to be voted upon by the
stockholders; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, except as otherwise required by
law, holders of common stock shall not be entitled to vote on any
amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) that
relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred
stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately
or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to
vote thereon pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(including any certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred
stock). For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to "this Corporation's
common stock" in the definition of "Voting Stock" in paragraph (C)(12) of
Article TENTH shall be deemed to be a reference to the common stock.

  



  

(b)  Nonvoting common stock shall not have any voting power (and shall not
be included in determining the number of shares voting or entitled to vote on
a given matter), except (i) that any amendment, alteration or repeal
(including by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of any provision of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that significantly and
adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Nonvoting common stock
contained in this Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, relative to
the effect of such amendment, alteration or repeal on the common stock, shall
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Nonvoting common stock, voting separately as a class, or (ii) as otherwise
required by applicable law. Each holder of Nonvoting common stock shall have
one vote for each share of Nonvoting common stock held by such holder on
all matters to be voted upon by the holders of Nonvoting common stock.

  



  

(3)   _Liquidation_. Subject to the preferences applicable to any series of
preferred stock, if any outstanding at any time, in the event of the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or
winding up of the Corporation, the holders of common stock and the holders of
Nonvoting common stock shall be entitled to share equally, on a per share
basis, all assets of the Corporation of whatever kind available for
distribution to the holders of Common Shares.

  



  

(4)   _Subdivision or Combinations_. If the Corporation in any manner
subdivides or combines the outstanding shares of one class of Common Shares
(including by way of a

  



  

   

2

 

    

dividend payable in shares of common stock or Nonvoting common stock, but
subject to the proviso to Section (B)(1) of this Article FOURTH), the
outstanding shares of the other class of Common Shares will be subdivided or
combined in the same manner proportionately and on the same basis per share.

  



  

(5)   _Transfer Restrictions_.

  



  

(a)  No holder of shares of Nonvoting common stock may transfer any shares
of Nonvoting common stock except pursuant to (i) a Permitted Inside Transfer
or (ii) a Permitted Outside Transfer.

  



  

(b)  Any attempt to transfer any shares of Nonvoting common stock not in
compliance herewith shall be null and void, and the Corporation shall not,
and shall cause the transfer agent, if any, for Nonvoting common stock not to,
give any effect in the Corporation's stock records to such attempted
transfer.

  



  

(6)   _Conversion of Nonvoting Common Stock_.

  



  

(a)   _Automatic Conversion Upon Permitted Outside Transfer_. Upon any
Permitted Outside Transfer, each share of Nonvoting common stock so
transferred shall, automatically and without the act of the holder thereof, be
converted into one share of common stock in the hands of the transferee,
subject to paragraph (B)(6)(b) of this Article FOURTH. Such conversion shall
take effect simultaneously with the applicable Permitted Outside Transfer.

  



  

(b)   _Certain Conversion Terms_. After any Permitted Outside Transfer, the
new holder of the shares of Nonvoting common stock so converted shall present
to the Corporation such evidence of transfer as the Corporation may reasonably
request, and as soon as practicable after the presentation thereof and, if
required, the payment of all transfer and similar taxes, the
Corporation shall issue and register in book-entry form in the name of such
holder the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion.
Each holder of Nonvoting common stock shall give prompt notice to the
Corporation of any Permitted Outside Transfer of shares of Nonvoting common
stock by such holder; _provided_ that in the case of any shares of Nonvoting
common stock that are sold by a holder thereof in an offering that is a
widespread public distribution under an effective registration
statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, no further
evidence or notice of transfer shall be required and each transferee shall
receive shares of common stock in such transfer, subject to the concurrent
delivery of the shares of Nonvoting common stock to the Corporation. All
shares of common stock issued or delivered upon conversion of shares of
Nonvoting common stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and shall be free of preemptive or similar rights and free of any lien or
adverse claim created by the Corporation. The Corporation shall take all such
actions as may be necessary to assure that all such shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Nonvoting common stock (i) will be listed or
quoted on each securities exchange upon which the common stock is listed or
quoted and (ii) will be so issued without violation of any applicable law or
governmental regulation (insofar as such applicable law or governmental
regulation applies generally to such issuance and not to unique
circumstances related to the relevant holder) or any requirements of any
securities exchange upon which shares may be listed or quoted (except, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), for official notice of issuance which shall be

  



  

   

3

 

    

immediately delivered by the Corporation upon each such issuance). The
Corporation shall not close its books against the transfer of
Nonvoting common stock or of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion
of Nonvoting common stock in any manner which interferes with the timely
conversion of Nonvoting common stock.

  



  

(c)   _Effect of Conversion_. Upon conversion as provided herein, each
outstanding share of Nonvoting common stock so converted shall cease to be
outstanding, dividends and distributions on such share shall cease to accrue
or be due and all rights in respect of such share shall terminate, other than
(i) the right to receive, upon compliance with paragraph (B)(6)(b) of this
Article FOURTH, appropriate evidence of the share of common stock registered
in book-entry form into which such share of Nonvoting common stock has been
converted and (ii) on the appropriate payment date after the date of
conversion, the amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such share of Nonvoting common stock with a record date prior to
the date of conversion and a payment date subsequent to the date of
conversion. The conversion of shares of Nonvoting common stock shall be made
without charge to the holder or holders of such shares for any issuance tax
in respect thereof or other costs incurred by the Corporation in connection
with such conversion.

  



  

(d)   _Reservation of Common Stock_. The Corporation shall, at all times
when any shares of Nonvoting common stock are outstanding, reserve and keep
available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued
common stock, the full number of shares of common stock then issuable upon
conversion of all then outstanding shares of Nonvoting common stock.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Corporation may, at its
election, deliver, upon conversion of Nonvoting common stock, treasury
shares of common stock or other shares of common stock that the Corporation
has reacquired, _provided_ such shares comply with the third sentence of
paragraph (B)(6)(b) of this Article FOURTH.

  



  

(7)   _No Optional Conversion._ At no time may any share of Nonvoting common
stock be converted at the option of the holder thereof unless the Corporation
ceases to be a savings and loan holding company and it does not control any
insured depository institution for purposes of the Home Owner's Loan Act of
1933 or Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, this paragraph (B)(7) of this Article FOURTH shall not affect the
automatic conversion of Nonvoting common stock upon a Permitted Outside
Transfer pursuant to paragraph (B)(6) of this Article FOURTH. If optional
conversion is at any time permitted in accordance with the first sentence of
this paragraph (B)(7) of this Article FOURTH, if any optional conversion of
Nonvoting common stock is to be made in connection with a merger,
consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of
common stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash
and/or any other property or any dissolution or liquidation, the optional
conversion of any shares of Nonvoting common stock may, at the election of the
holder thereof, be conditioned upon the consummation of such event or
transaction, in which case such conversion shall not be deemed to be
effective until such event or transaction has been consummated.

  



  

(8)   _Equal Status_. Except as expressly provided in this Article FOURTH,
common stock and Nonvoting common stock shall have the same rights and
privileges and rank equally, share ratably, be identical in all respect as to
all matters and be treated equally by the Corporation in any merger (other
than any merger to create a holding company in which the

  



  

   

4

 

    

common stock and Nonvoting common stock are treated equally except that each
receives securities that mirror their respective Common Shares),
consolidation, share exchange pursuant to an exchange offer by the
Corporation, share repurchase pursuant to a tender offer, tender offer
pursuant to an agreement to which the Corporation is a party or other similar
transaction; _provided_  that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Corporation from making open market repurchases of
common stock without repurchasing or offering to repurchase Nonvoting common
stock.

  



  

(9)  The following definitions shall apply with respect to this Article
FOURTH:

  



  

(a)  "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with such Person. For purposes of this definition, "control" (including,
with correlative meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under common
control with") has the meaning set forth in 12 C.F.R. § 238.2(e) or 12 C.F.R.
§ 225.2(e)(1), as applicable.

  



  

(b)  "Permitted Inside Transfer" means any transfer of shares of Nonvoting
common stock by a holder thereof to an Affiliate of such holder; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, if, following such transfer, the
transferee ceases to be an Affiliate of the transferor, such transfer shall
not be considered a Permitted Outside Transfer that results in the conversion
of the Nonvoting common stock into common stock pursuant to paragraph (B)(6)
of Article FOURTH.

  



  

(c)  "Permitted Outside Transfer" means any transfer of shares of Nonvoting
common stock by a holder thereof (i) in a widespread public distribution (or
to an underwriter solely for the purpose of conducting a widespread public
distribution), (ii) in a transfer in which no relevant transferee (or group
of associated transferees) acquires 2% or more of any "class of voting
shares" (as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 238.2(r)(3) or 12 C.F.R. § 225.2(q)(3), as
applicable) of the Corporation, (iii) to a transferee that would own or
control more than 50% of any "class of voting shares" (as defined in 12
C.F.R. § 238.2(r)(3) or 12 C.F.R. § 225.2(q)(3), as applicable) of the
Corporation without regard to any transfer of shares from the transferring
