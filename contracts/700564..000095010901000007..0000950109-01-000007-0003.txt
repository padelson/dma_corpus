AND PLAN OF MERGER made as of the 27th day of December, 2000, by and between
FULTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania business corporation having its
administrative headquarters at One Penn Square, P. O. Box 4887, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania 17604 ("FFC"), and DROVERS BANCSHARES CORPORATION,
a Pennsylvania business corporation having its administrative headquarters at
30 South George Street, York, Pennsylvania 17401 ("DBC").   BACKGROUND:  
FFC is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). DBC is a bank holding
company registered under the BHC Act which is the parent of The Drovers and
Mechanics Bank ("Drovers Bank"). In addition to Drovers Bank, DBC has two
wholly-owned subsidiaries: Drovers Realty Company and Drovers Capital Trust
I. Drovers Bank has two-wholly-owned subsidiaries: 96 South George Street,
Inc. and Drovers Investment Company and owns 60% of the membership interests
in Drovers Settlement Services LLC. Drovers Bank and all of such subsidiaries
are collectively referred to herein as "DBC Subsidiaries". FFC and DBC wish
to merge with each other. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the foregoing transaction will be accomplished by means of a
merger (the "Merger") in which (i) DBC will be merged with and into FFC, (ii)
FFC will survive the Merger, and (iii) all of the outstanding shares of the
common stock of DBC, no par value per share ("DBC Common Stock"), will be
converted into shares of the common stock of FFC, par value $2.50 per share
("FFC Common Stock").   Simultaneously with the effectiveness of the Merger
and subject to appropriate documentation and regulatory approvals, FFC shall
cause Drovers Bank to merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into Fulton Bank, an
existing bank subsidiary of FFC, and transfer the trust business of Drovers
to Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. ("Advisors"), an affiliate of FFC,
immediately after the Bank Merger (the "Trust Business Transfer") (the Bank
Merger, the Trust Business Transfer, along with any branch consolidations
and/or closures deemed desirable by FFC, is referred to herein as the
"Restructuring").   Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the
parties are entering into a Warrant Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit A  --------- attached hereto (the "Warrant Agreement"), which
provides for the delivery by DBC of a warrant in substantially the form of
Exhibit B attached hereto (the  --------- "Warrant") entitling FFC to
purchase shares of the DBC Common Stock in certain circumstances.  
WITNESSETH:   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
contained herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree
as follows:    ARTICLE I. THE MERGER   Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, DBC shall merge with and into FFC in accordance
with the following:   Section 1.1. Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 9.2  ----------- ------ herein) (i) DBC shall merge with and into
FFC pursuant to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law
of 1988, as amended (the "BCL"), whereupon the separate existence of DBC
shall cease and FFC shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and (ii) the DBC Common Stock
will be converted into FFC Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Article
II hereof.   Section 1.2. Name. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be "Fulton  ----------- ---- Financial Corporation". The address of the
principal office of the Surviving Corporation will be One Penn Square, P.O.
Box 4887, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17604.   Section 1.3. Articles of
Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of  -----------
-------------------------- the Surviving Corporation shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of FFC as in effect at the Effective Time.   Section 1.4.
Bylaws. The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the  -----------
------ Bylaws of FFC as in effect at the Effective Time.   Section 1.5
Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of the  -----------
---------------------- Surviving Corporation shall be the directors and
officers of FFC in office at the Effective Time. Each of such directors and
officers shall serve until such time as his successor is duly elected and has
qualified.   ARTICLE II. CONVERSION OF SHARES AND EXCHANGE OF STOCK
CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time (as
defined in  ----------- -------------------- Section 9.2 herein) the shares
of DBC Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into shares of FFC
Common Stock, as follows:   (a) General: Subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(c)  ------- and 2.1(d) herein, each share of DBC Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, shall, at
the Effective Time, be converted into and become without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, and in exchange therefor FFC shall issue, 1.24
(such number, as it may be adjusted under Section 2.1(b) herein, the
"Conversion Ratio") shares of FFC Common Stock and the corresponding number
of rights associated therewith pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated June
20, 1989, as amended and restated as of April 27, 1999, between FFC and
Fulton Bank. Each share of DBC Common Stock to be converted into FFC Common
Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be
canceled and retired, and each holder of share certificates evidencing shares
of DBC Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive FFC Common
Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to the shares represented thereby, except the right to receive
the FFC Common Stock therefor, without interest thereon, upon the  
-2-   surrender of the share certificates evidencing the DBC Common Stock
in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof.   (b) Antidilution Provision: In the
event that FFC shall at any  ---------------------- time before the
Effective Time: (i) issue a dividend in shares of FFC Common Stock, (ii)
combine the outstanding shares of FFC Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, or (iii) subdivide the outstanding shares of FFC Common Stock into a
greater number of shares, then the Conversion Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted (calculated to four decimal places), so that each DBC shareholder
shall receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for his shares of DBC Common
Stock, the number of shares of FFC Common Stock as would then have been owned
by him if the Effective Time had occurred before the record date of such
event (For example, if FFC were to declare a five percent (5%) stock dividend
after the date of this Agreement and if the record date for that
stock dividend were to occur before the Effective Time, the Conversion Ratio
would be adjusted from 1.24 shares to 1.302 shares).   (c) No Fractional
Shares: No fractional shares of FFC Common  -------------------- Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any
fractional share to which he would otherwise be entitled, each
former shareholder of DBC shall receive in cash an amount equal to the fair
market value of his fractional interest, which fair market value shall be
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Closing Market Price (as
defined in Section 2.1(e) herein).   (d) Cancelled DBC Shares.
Notwithstanding the provisions of  -------------------- Section 2.1(a)
herein, the following shares of DBC Common Stock shall not be converted into
FFC Common Stock, and shall be cancelled, at the Effective Time: (i)
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.8 herein); (ii) shares of
DBC Common Stock then owned by FFC or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
FFC (except for trust account shares or shares acquired in connection with
debts previously contracted); and (iii) shares of DBC Shares owned by DBC or
any direct or indirect subsidiary of DBC (except for trust account shares or
shares acquired in connection with debts previously contracted).   (e)
Closing Market Price: For purposes of this Agreement, the 
-------------------- Closing Market Price shall be the average of the per
share closing bid and asked prices for FFC Common Stock, calculated to two
decimal places, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the date which is two (2) business days before the Effective Date
(as such term is defined in Section 9.2 herein), as reported on the National
Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), the foregoing period of ten (10) trading days
being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Price Determination Period"
(For example, if June 30, 2001 were to be the Effective Date, then the Price
Determination Period would be June 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27,
2001). In the event that NASDAQ shall fail to report closing bid and asked
prices for FFC Common Stock for any trading day during the Price
Determination Period, the closing bid and asked prices for that day shall be
equal to the average of the closing bid and asked prices as quoted: (i) by F.
J. Morrissey and Company, Inc. and by Ryan, Beck and Co.; or (ii) in the event
that both of these firms are not then making a market in FFC Common Stock, by
two brokerage firms then making a market in FFC Common Stock to be
selected by FFC and approved by DBC.   -3-    Section 2.2. Exchange of
Stock Certificates. DBC Common Stock certificates  -----------
------------------------------- shall be exchanged for FFC Common Stock
certificates in accordance with the following procedures:   (a) Exchange
Agent: The transfer agent of FFC shall act as  -------------- exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") to receive DBC Common Stock certificates from the
holders thereof and to exchange such stock certificates for FFC Common Stock
certificates and (if applicable) to pay cash for fractional shares of
FFC Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) herein. FFC shall cause the
Exchange Agent on or promptly after the Effective Date, to mail to each
former shareholder of DBC a notice specifying the procedures to be followed
in surrendering such shareholder\'s DBC Common Stock certificates.   (b)
Surrender of Certificates As promptly as possible after 
------------------------- receipt of the Exchange Agent\'s notice, each
former shareholder of DBC shall surrender his DBC Common Stock certificates
to the Exchange Agent; provided,  -------- that if any former shareholder of
DBC shall be unable to surrender his DBC Common Stock certificates due to
loss or mutilation thereof, he may make a constructive surrender by following
procedures comparable to those customarily used by FFC for issuing
replacement certificates to FFC shareholders whose FFC Common Stock
certificates have been lost or mutilated. Upon receiving a proper actual or
constructive surrender of DBC Common Stock certificates from a former DBC
shareholder, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such shareholder, in
exchange therefor, an FFC Common Stock certificate representing the whole
number of shares of FFC Common Stock into which such shareholder\'s shares of
DBC Common Stock have been converted in accordance with this Article II,
together with a check in the amount of any cash to which such shareholder is
entitled, pursuant to Section 2.1(c) herein, in lieu of the issuance of a
fractional share.   (c) Dividend Withholding: Dividends, if any, payable by
FFC after  -------------------- the Effective Time to any former shareholder
of DBC who has not prior to the payment date surrendered his DBC Common Stock
certificates may, at the option of FFC, be withheld. Any dividends so
withheld shall be paid, without interest, to such former shareholder of DBC
upon proper surrender of his DBC Common Stock certificates.   (d) Failure
to Surrender Certificates: All DBC Common Stock 
--------------------------------- certificates must be actually or
constructively (as referenced in (b) above) surrendered to the Exchange Agent
within two (2) years after the Effective Date. In the event that any former
shareholder of DBC shall not have properly surrendered his DBC Common Stock
certificates within two (2) years after the Effective Date, the shares of FFC
Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued to him may, at the option
of FFC, be sold and the net proceeds of such sale, together with the cash (if
any) to which he is entitled in lieu of the issuance of a fractional share
and any previously accrued dividends, shall be held by the Exchange Agent in
a noninterest bearing account for his benefit. From and after any such sale,
the sole right of such former shareholder of DBC shall be the right to
collect such net proceeds, cash and accumulated dividends. Subject to all
applicable laws of escheat, such net proceeds, cash and accumulated dividends
shall be paid to such former shareholder of DBC, without interest, upon
proper actual or constructive surrender of his DBC Common
Stock certificates.   -4-    (e) Expenses: All costs and expenses
associated with the foregoing  -------- surrender and exchange procedure
shall be borne by FFC.   Section 2.3. Treatment of Outstanding DBC
Options.  ----------- ------------------------------------   (a) At the
Effective Time, each holder of an option (collectively, "DBC Options") to
purchase shares of DBC Common Stock that (i) is outstanding at the Effective
Time, (ii) has been granted pursuant to the Drovers Bancshares Corporation
Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Drovers Bancshares Corporation 1995 Stock
Option Plan and the Drovers Bancshares Corporation 1999 Non-
Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "DBC Stock Option
Plans") and (iii) would otherwise survive the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive, in substitution for such DBC Option, an option to
acquire shares of FFC Common Stock on the terms set forth below (each DBC
Option as substituted, an "FFC Stock Option").   (b) An FFC Stock Option
shall be a stock option to acquire shares of FFC Common Stock with the
following terms: (i) the number of shares of FFC Common Stock which may be
acquired pursuant to such FFC Stock Option shall be equal to the product of
the number of shares of DBC Common Stock covered by the DBC Option multiplied
by the Conversion Ratio, provided that any fractional share of FFC Common
Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest
whole share; (ii) the exercise price per share of FFC Common Stock shall be
equal to the exercise price per share of DBC Common Stock of such DBC Option,
divided by the Conversion Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be
rounded to the nearest whole cent; (iii) the duration and other terms of
such FFC Option shall be identical to the duration and other terms of such
DBC Option, except that all references to DBC shall be deemed to be
references to FFC and its affiliates, where the context so requires and shall
remain exercisable until the stated expiration date of the corresponding DBC
Option; (iv) FFC shall assume such DBC stock option, whether vested or not
vested, as contemplated by Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"); and (v) to the extent DBC Options qualify as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, the FFC Options
exchanged therefor shall also so qualify. Subject to the FFC Stock Options
and the foregoing, the DBC Stock Option Plans and all options or other rights
to acquire DBC Common Stock issued thereunder shall terminate at the
Effective Time. FFC shall not issue or pay for any fraction shares otherwise
issuable upon exercise of a FFC Stock Option.   (c) Prior to the Effective
Time, FFC shall take appropriate action to reserve for issuance and, if not
previously registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"1933 Act"), register the number of shares of FFC Common Stock necessary to
satisfy FFC\'s obligations with respect to the issuance of FFC Common Stock
pursuant to the exercise of FFC Stock Options and under Section 2.3.   (d)
Prior to the Effective Time (to the extent required as determined by FFC or
DBC under applicable law, the terms of the DBC Stock Option Plans or
otherwise), FFC shall receive agreements from each holder of a DBC Option,
pursuant to which each such holder agrees to accept an FFC Option
in substitution for the DBC Option, as of the Effective Time.   -5-   
(e) Schedule 2.3 sets forth a listing of each DBC Option as of 
------------ the date of this Agreement (copies of which have been provided
to FFC), including the optionee, date of grant, shares of DBC Common Stock
subject to such Option, the exercise price of such Option, expiration date,
classification as an incentive stock option or a nonqualified stock option,
vesting schedule and any special features thereof.   Section 2.4.
Reservation of Shares. FFC agrees that (i) prior to the  -----------
--------------------- Effective Time it will take appropriate action to
reserve a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of FFC Common
Stock to be issued in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) at the

------ notify FFC in writing of any actions, claims, investigations,
proceedings or other developments which, if pending or in existence on the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed to FFC in
order to ensure the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement or which otherwise could materially and adversely affect
the condition (financial or otherwise), assets,   -24-   liabilities,
business operations or future prospects of DBC or any of the DBC Subsidiaries
or restrict in any manner their ability to carry on their respective
businesses as presently conducted.   Section 5.7. No Solicitation. 
----------- ---------------   (a) DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries shall not,
and shall not authorize or permit any of their officers, directors or
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor or attorney to initiate
or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take
any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, provided, however, that if, at any time the Board of Directors of
DBC determines in good faith, based on the written advice of outside counsel,
that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, DBC, in response to a written
Acquisition Proposal that (i) was unsolicited or that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section, and (ii) is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal, may (x) furnish non-public information with respect
to DBC or the DBC Subsidiaries to the person who made such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y)
participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director or officer
of DBC or any of the DBC Subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant, or other representative of DBC or any of the
DBC Subsidiaries, whether or not acting on behalf of DBC or any of its
subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section by DBC.   (b)
DBC shall call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as promptly as
practicable for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and shall take, in
good faith, all actions which are necessary or appropriate on its part in
order to secure the approval of this Agreement by its shareholders at
the meeting, including recommending the approval of this Agreement by
DBC\'s shareholders; provided, however, that DBC\'s Board of Directors shall
not be required to take any action otherwise required by this sentence that
it has determined in good faith, based on the advice of outside counsel,
would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law.   (c) The Board of Directors of DBC shall not (1)
fail to recommend this Agreement, withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to FFC, its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger unless there is an Acquisition Proposal outstanding,
(2) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal or (3) cause DBC to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal unless (x) the Board of Directors of DBC shall have
determined in good faith, based on the written advice of outside counsel,
that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) the applicable Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section
shall prohibit DBC from at any time taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the  
-25-   Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided, however, that
neither DBC nor its Board of Directors shall, except as permitted by
paragraph (b) of this section, propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal.   (e) DBC shall promptly (but in any event within one
day) advise FFC orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry regarding the making of an Acquisition Proposal including any request
for information, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. DBC will, to the extent reasonably
practicable, keep FFC fully informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry.   (f) (i) In the event the Board of Directors of DBC takes any
of the actions set forth in clauses (1), (2) and/or (3) of Section 5.7(c)
in compliance with the standards in (x) and (y) therein, such action shall
allow termination of this Agreement by FFC under Section 8.1(b)(iii) herein
which shall be treated in the same manner as termination under Section 8.1(a)
herein and shall allow exercise of the Warrant. In the event the Board of
Directors of DBC takes any of the actions set forth in clauses (1), (2)
and/or (3) of Section 5.7(c) without compliance with the standards in (x) and
(y) therein, such action shall constitute a breach allowing termination of
this Agreement by FFC under Section 8.1(c)(iii) herein which shall be treated
in the same manner as termination by FFC under Section 8.1(b)(i) herein and
shall allow exercise of the Warrant.   (ii) This Agreement may be
terminated by DBC prior to the shareholders meeting of DBC if (A) the Board
of Directors of DBC shall have determined in good faith based on the advice
of outside counsel that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to DBC\'s shareholders under
applicable law, (B) it is not in breach of its obligations under this Section
5.7 in any material respect and has complied with, and continues to comply
with, all requirements and procedures of this Section 5.7 in all material
respects and has authorized, subject to complying with the terms of this
Agreement, DBC to enter into a binding written agreement for a transaction
that constitutes a Superior Proposal and DBC notifies FFC in writing that it
intends to enter into such agreement, attaching the most current version of
such agreement to such notice; (C) FFC does not make, within five
(5) business days after receipt of DBC\'s written notice of its intention to
enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal, any offer that the
Board of Directors reasonably and in good faith determines, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable
to the shareholders of DBC as the Superior Proposal and during such period
DBC reasonably considers and discusses in good faith all proposals submitted
by FFC and, without limiting the foregoing, meets with, and causes its
financial and legal advisors to meet with, FFC and its advisors from time to
time as required by FFC to consider and discuss in good faith FFC\'s
proposals, and (D) prior to DBC\'s termination pursuant to this Section
5.7(f)(ii), DBC confirms in writing that such termination allows exercise of
the Warrant. DBC agrees (x) that it will not enter into a binding agreement
referred to in clause (B) above until at least the five (5) business days
after FFC has received the notice to FFC required by clause (B) and (y) to
notify FFC promptly if its intention to enter into a binding agreement
referred to in its notice to FFC shall change at any time after giving such
notice.   -26-    (g) For the purpose of this Section 5.7:   (i)
"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean a written proposal or written offer (other
than by another party hereto) for a tender or exchange offer for securities
of DBC or any of the DBC Subsidiaries, or a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving an acquisition of DBC or any of the DBC
Subsidiaries or any proposal to acquire in any manner a substantial equity
interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of DBC or any of the DBC
Subsidiaries.   (ii) A "Superior Proposal" shall be an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of DBC believes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor) is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the source of its financing, on
the terms proposed and, believes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and after taking into account the strategic benefits
anticipated to be derived from the Merger and the long-term prospects of DBC
and the DBC Subsidiaries as a combined company), would, if consummated,
result in a transaction more favorable to the shareholders of DBC from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor)
that the person making such Acquisition Proposal has, or is reasonably likely
to have or obtain, any necessary funds or customary commitments to provide
any funds necessary to consummate such Acquisition Proposal.   Section 5.8.
Affiliate Letters. DBC shall use its best efforts to deliver  -----------
----------------- or cause to be delivered to FFC, at or before the Closing,
a letter from each of the officers and directors of DBC (and shall use its
best efforts to obtain and deliver such a letter from each shareholder of
DBC) who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as that term is defined for
purposes of Rules 145 and 405 promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act) of
DBC, in form and substance satisfactory to FFC, under the terms of which each
such officer, director or shareholder acknowledges and agrees to abide by all
limitations imposed by the 1933 Act and by all rules, regulations and
releases promulgated thereunder by the SEC with respect to the sale or other
disposition of the shares of FFC Common Stock to be received by such person

SEC Rules 145 and 405) of DBC does not, purchase or sell on NASDAQ, or submit
a bid to purchase or an offer to sell on NASDAQ, directly or indirectly, any
shares of FFC Common Stock or any options, rights or other securities
convertible into shares of FFC Common Stock during the Price Determination
Period.   Section 5.10. Dividends. DBC shall not declare or pay a cash

that DBC may declare and pay a dividend on the DBC Common Stock on each of
(i) March 30, 2001 in the amount of $.13 per share, (ii) June 29, 2001 in the
amount of $.14 per share, provided that the Effective Date does not occur (or
is not expected to occur) on or before the record date for the dividend on
the FFC Common Stock scheduled to be   -27-   paid on July 15, 2001;
(iii) September 28, 2001 in the amount of $.14 per share, provided that the
Effective Date does not occur (or is not expected to occur) on or before the
record date for the dividend on the FFC Common Stock scheduled to be paid on
October 15, 2001 (it being the intent of FFC and DBC that DBC be permitted to
pay a dividend on the DBC Common Stock on the dates indicated in subsections
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above only if the shareholders of DBC, upon becoming
shareholders of FFC, would not be entitled to receive a dividend on the FFC
Common Stock on the payment dates indicated in such subsections).   Section
5.11. Accounting Treatment. DBC acknowledges that FFC intends to 
------------ -------------------- treat the Merger as a "pooling-of-interest"
for financial reporting purposes. DBC shall not take (and shall use its best
efforts not to permit any of the directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, agents, consultants or other representatives of DBC to take)
any action that would preclude FFC from treating such business combination as
a "pooling-of-interests" for financial reporting purposes.   ARTICLE VI.

the  ------------- effect of causing the Merger not to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.   Section 6.2. Access to
Properties and Records. FFC shall give to DBC and to  -----------
-------------------------------- its authorized employees and representatives
(including without limitation DBC\'s counsel, accountants, economic and
environmental consultants and other designated representatives) such access
during normal business hours to all properties, books, contracts, documents
and records of FFC as DBC may reasonably request, subject to the obligation
of DBC and its authorized employees and representatives to maintain the
confidentiality of all nonpublic information concerning FFC obtained by
reason of such access.   Section 6.3. Subsequent Financial Statements.
Between the date of signing  ----------- ------------------------------- of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, FFC shall promptly prepare and
deliver to DBC as soon as practicable each Quarterly Report to FFC\'s

referred to as the "Additional FFC Financial Statements") set forth in the
foregoing Quarterly Reports and any Annual Report to FFC\'s shareholders.  
Section 6.4. Update Schedules. FFC shall promptly disclose to DBC in

modification to the information set forth in its Schedules to this
Agreement.   Section 6.5. Notice. FFC shall promptly notify DBC in writing

which otherwise could materially and adversely affect the condition
(financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities, business, operations or  
-29-   future prospects of FFC or restrict in any manner the right of FFC
to carry on its business as presently conducted.   Section 6.6. Employment
Arrangements.  ----------- -----------------------   (a) From and after the

Obligations (as defined in Section 3.17 herein), (B) use its best efforts to
retain each present full-time employee of DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries at
such employee\'s current position (or, if offered to, and accepted by, an
employee, a position for which the employee is qualified with the FFC
Employers at a salary commensurate with the position), (C) pay compensation
to each person who was employed as of the Effective Time and who continues to
be employed by the FFC Employers on and after the Effective Time, that is at
least equal to the aggregate compensation that such person was receiving from
DBC or the DBC Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (unless there is a
material change in the duties and responsibilities of such employee), (ii) in
the event that the FFC Employers shall continue to employ officers
or employees of DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, the
FFC Employers shall employ such persons on the Effective Time as "at
will" employees, and (iii) in the event the FFC Employers are not willing to
employ, or terminate the employment (other than as a result of
unsatisfactory performance of their respective duties and provided that a
requirement to regularly perform duties at a location which is more than 25
miles from both an employee\'s principal place of employment with DBC and
Drovers Bank and his residence as of the date of this Agreement may be
treated as a termination of employment of such employee) of any officers or
employees of DBC or the DBC Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, the FFC
Employers shall pay severance benefits to such employee (other than employees
who receive payments under an Employment Obligation) as follows: (A) in the
event employment is terminated on or prior to the date which is one year
after the Effective Date, two week\'s salary plus one week\'s salary for each
year of service with DBC or the DBC Subsidiaries, with a maximum of fifty-two
week\'s salary; or (B) in the event employment is terminated thereafter, in

Plan and the Drovers and Mechanics Bank Pension Plan (the "DBC Retirement
Plans") for all employees of DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries who are
participants in the DBC Retirement Plans as of the Effective Time and who
become employees of the FFC Employers, provided however, FFC Employers shall
be obligated to continue the Drovers Retirement Plans for those former DBC
and DBC Subsidiaries\' employee participants until the earlier of: (A) the
date that the Drovers Retirement Plans can no longer satisfy applicable
qualified retirement plan discrimination testing under the Code (taking into
consideration all methods available for satisfying discrimination testing
applicable to qualified retirement plans under the Code), or (B) the last day
of the plan year of the Drovers Retirement Plans in which it is determined
that the minimum required cash contribution, as determined under the Code for
the Drovers and Mechanics Bank pension plan and the matching contribution
under the Drovers and Mechanics Bank Salary Deferral Plan (based on the
formula as of the Effective Time), exceed 10% of the participant covered
payroll; thereafter DBC and DBC Subsidiaries\' employees shall participate
under the retirement plans provided by the FFC Employers for FFC employees;
and (ii)   -30-   with respect to non-retirement plan employee benefits,
the FFC Employers shall provide employee benefits for all employees of DBC
and the DBC Subsidiaries who become employees of the FFC Employers which are
substantially equivalent to or better than, in the aggregate, the non-
retirement plan employee benefits provided by DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries to
the employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. DBC and the DBC
Subsidiaries\' employees who became employed by the FFC Employers shall
receive service credit for vesting and eligibility purposes under the
employee benefit plans of FFC for their service with DBC and the DBC
Subsidiaries up through the Effective Time, provided, however, with respect
to vesting and eligibility service credit under the FFC retirement plans,
vesting and eligibility credit shall only be required at the point in time it
is determined that the DBC and DBC Subsidiaries\' employees are
to participate in the FFC retirement plans.   Section 6.7. No Purchase or
Sales of FFC Common Stock During Price  -----------

of FFC, nor any shareholder of FFC who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as
that term is defined for purposes of Rules 145 and 405 promulgated by the SEC
under the 1933 Act) of FFC, shall purchase or sell on NASDAQ, or submit a bid
to purchase or an offer to sell on NASDAQ, directly or indirectly, any shares
of FFC Common Stock or any options, rights or other securities convertible
into shares of FFC Common Stock during the Price Determination Period;
provided, however, that FFC may purchase shares of FFC Common Stock in the
ordinary course of business during the Price Determination Period pursuant to
FFC\'s Benefit Plans or FFC\'s Dividend Reinvestment Plan.   Section 6.8.
Drovers Division and Drovers Regional Directors.  -----------
-----------------------------------------------   (a) For a period of at
least three (3) years after the Effective Date, FFC shall (subject to the
right of FFC and the Drovers Regional Directors to terminate such obligations
under this Section 6.8(a) pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) below) (i)
operate the former business of Drovers Bank as the York Division of Fulton
Bank (subject to the Trust Business Transfer and such consolidations and/or
closures of branch offices of Fulton Bank and Drovers Bank as deemed
desirable by FFC) (the "Drovers Division") under the name "Drovers Bank, a
division of Fulton Bank" or similar designation authorized by the Department
(and to which the FDIC has no objection); and (ii) appoint the present
directors of Drovers Bank who indicate their desire to serve (the "Drovers
Regional Directors") on the board of the Drovers Division (the "Regional
Board"), provided, that, after such three-year period, each Regional Director
shall be subject to FFC\'s mandatory retirement rules for directors.   (b)
For a period of three (3) years after the Effective Date (subject to the
right of FFC and to Drovers Regional Directors to terminate such obligations
under this Section 6.8(b) under subsections (c) and (d) below), each non-
employee Drovers Regional Director and each director of FFC or Fulton
Bank shall continue to receive aggregate director\'s fees from FFC or Fulton
Bank in an amount not less than the fees he or she was receiving from DBC and
the DBC Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date (the current fees being set
forth on Schedule 6.8 and to remain unchanged through the Effective Date) or,
if higher, ------------ the fees paid by FFC or Fulton Bank, as applicable,
to its directors, provided that, in the event an individual ceases to act as
a director of the   -31-   Regional Board, FFC or Fulton Bank, the
foregoing obligation to maintain existing fees and benefits shall not apply
to successors in such positions.   (c) FFC shall have the right to terminate
its obligations under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.8 as a result
of (i) regulatory requirements, (ii) safe and sound banking practices, or
(iii) the exercise of their fiduciary duties by FFC\'s directors.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Drovers Regional
Directors, in their exercise of their fiduciary duty as to the best interests
of Fulton Bank and FFC, may, by a majority vote of such directors, modify or
waive any or all of the foregoing provisions in subsections (a) and (b) of
this Section 6.8.   Section 6.9 Insurance; Indemnification. 
--------------------------   (a) For three years after the Effective Date,
FFC shall (and Drovers Bank shall cooperate in these efforts) obtain and
maintain (a) "tail" coverage relating to DBC\'s existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy (provided that such insurance shall be in
such amount and carry such premium as may be reasonably acceptable to FFC
(not to exceed 150% of the current premium for DBC\'s existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy) and that FFC may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are substantially no less advantageous) with respect to
claims arising from facts or circumstances which occur prior to the Effective
Date (other than relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) and covering persons who are covered by such insurance immediately
prior to the Effective Date and (b) provide the Drovers Bank Continuing
Directors with coverage under a directors and officers liability policy or
policies similar to the coverage provided to directors of other subsidiaries
of FFC.   (b) From and after the Effective Date, FFC shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, an
officer, employee or director of DBC or a DBC Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent
of FFC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim") in
which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or a
witness based in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was
a director, officer or employee of DBC or a DBC Subsidiary if such Claim
pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Date (including, without limitation, the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) regardless of whether such Claim
is asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Date
(the "Indemnified Liabilities") to the full extent permitted under applicable
law as to the date hereof or amended prior to the Effective Date and under
the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of DBC or a DBC Subsidiary as in
effect as of the date hereof (and FFC shall pay expenses in advance of the
full disposition of any such action or proceeding to each of the Indemnified
Parties to the full extent permitted by applicable law and FFC\'s Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this provision, upon learning of any claim, shall
notify   -32-   FFC (but the failure to so notify FFC shall not relieve
FFC from any liability which FFC may have under this section except to the
extent FFC is materially prejudiced thereby). In the defense of any action
covered by this Section 6.9(b), FFC shall have the right to direct the
defense of such action and retain counsel of its choice; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group may
retain a single law firm to represent them with respect to each matter under
this section if there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of FFC and the
Indemnified Parties (the Indemnified Parties may also retain more than one
law firm if there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict of any significant issues between the positions of two or more
Indemnified Parties). FFC shall have an obligation to advance funds to
satisfy an obligation of FFC or any successor to FFC under this Section
6.9(b) to the same extent that FFC would be obligated to advance funds under

faith judgment believes will have a significant adverse impact on the

(ii) impose any condition upon FFC, or any of its subsidiaries, which in
FFC\'s good faith judgment (x) would be materially burdensome to FFC and

redemption of the fractional share in an amount equal to the difference
between the cash received and the adjusted basis of the fractional share.

this Agreement; provided, however, that if FFC agrees to defend and indemnify
DBC and  -------- ------- Drovers Bank and their respective officers and
directors with regard to any such action, suit or proceeding pending or
threatened against them or any of them, then such pending or threatened
action, suit or proceeding shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of a
condition precedent to the obligation of DBC to consummate this
Agreement.   (g) Pooling. FFC and DBC shall have been advised in writing
by  ------- Arthur Andersen, LLP on the Effective Date that the Merger

-35-    (b) Covenants Performed: DBC shall have performed or complied in 
------------------- all material respects with each of the covenants required

FFC, affiliates of the foregoing, and others.   (d) Affiliate Agreements:
Shareholders of DBC who are or will be  -------------------- affiliates of
DBC or FFC for the purposes of Accounting Series Release No. 135 and the 1933

the generality of the foregoing sentence, the Additional DBC Financial
Statements (as defined in Section 5.4) shall indicate that the consolidated
financial condition, assets, liabilities and results of operations of DBC as
of the respective dates reported therein do not vary adversely in any
material respect from the consolidated financial condition, assets,
liabilities and results of operations presented in the DBC Balance Sheet. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(f), a material and adverse change shall mean an
event, change, or occurrence which, individually or together with any other
event, change, or occurrence, has a material adverse impact on (i) the
financial position, business or results of operations or future prospects of
DBC or (ii) the ability of DBC to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, provided that "material and adverse change" shall not be deemed to
include the impact of (a) changes in banking and similar laws of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental
authorities, (b) changes in GAAP or regulatory accounting principles
generally applicable to banks and their holding companies, (c) actions or
omissions of DBC taken at the direction or behest of FFC with the prior
written consent of FFC, including any action or actions, individually or in
the aggregate, taken by DBC or the DBC Subsidiaries, (d) changes in
economic conditions generally affecting financial institutions including
changes in the general level of interest rates, and (e) the direct effects of
compliance with this Agreement and of satisfying or causing to be satisfied
the conditions set forth in this Article VII on the operating performance of
DBC, including reasonable expenses incurred by DBC in consummating the

described herein.   -36-    (g) Accountants\' Letter. Subject to the
requirements of Statement  ------------------- of Auditing Standards No. 72
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Arthur Andersen
LLP, or such other accounting firm as is acceptable to FFC, shall have
furnished to FFC an "agreed upon procedures" letter, dated the Effective
Date, in form and substance satisfactory to FFC to the effect that:   (1)
In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of DBC examined by
them and included in the Registration Statement comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act
and the published rules and regulations thereunder; and   (2) On the basis
of limited procedures, not constituting an audit, including a limited review
of the unaudited financial statements referred to below, a limited review of

December 31, 2000, inquiries of officials of DBC and the DBC Subsidiaries
responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and
procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
attention that caused them to believe that:   (A) any unaudited Consolidated
Statements of Condition, Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated
Statements of Shareholders\' Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
of DBC included in the Registration Statement are not in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially
consistent with that of the audited financial statements covered by their

not more than five days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there

compared with amounts shown in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2000
included in the Registration Statement, except in each case for such changes,
increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have
occurred or may occur and except for such changes, decreases or increases as
aforesaid which are immaterial; and   (C) for the period from January 1,
2001 to such specified date, there were any decreases in the consolidated
total or per share amounts of net interest income, consolidated net interest
income after provision for loan losses, consolidated other income or
consolidated net income of DBC as compared with the comparable period of the
preceding year, except in each case for decreases which the Registration
Statement discloses have occurred or may occur, and except for such decreases
which are immaterial.   (h) Federal and State Securities and Antitrust Laws:

Environmental Matters: No environmental problem of the kind 
--------------------- contemplated in Section 3.22 and not disclosed in

prospects of either DBC or Drovers Bank.   (j) Closing Documents: DBC shall
have delivered to FFC: (i) a  ----------------- certificate signed by DBC\'s
Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer and by its Secretary (or
other officers reasonably acceptable to FFC) verifying that all of the
representations and warranties of DBC set forth in this Agreement are true
and correct in all material respects as of the Closing and that DBC has
performed in all material respects each of the covenants required to be
performed by it under this Agreement; (ii) all consents and authorizations of

may reasonably request (all of the foregoing certificates and other documents
being herein referred to as the "DBC Closing Documents").   (k) Dissenting

---------------------------------------------- of DBC to consummate this
Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions prior to or as of the Closing, except to the extent that any such
condition shall have been waived by DBC in accordance with the provisions of

the  ------------------------------------------ representations and
warranties of FFC as set forth in this Agreement, all of the information
contained in its Schedules hereto and all FFC Closing Documents (as defined
in Section 7.3(g) of this Agreement) shall be true and correct in

date to which it relates in the case of any representation or warranty which
expressly relates to an earlier date).   (b) Covenants Performed: FFC shall
have performed or complied in  ------------------- all material respects
with each of the covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by FFC.   (c) Opinion of Counsel for FFC: DBC shall have

reasonable satisfaction that, since the date of this Agreement, there shall

otherwise), assets, liabilities, business or operations or future prospects
of FFC. In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing
sentence, the Additional FFC Financial Statements (as defined in Section 6.3)
shall indicate that the consolidated financial condition, assets, liabilities
and results of operations of FFC as of the respective dates reported therein
do not vary adversely in any material respect from the consolidated financial
condition, assets, liabilities and results of operations presented in the FFC
Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Section 7.3(e), a material and adverse
change shall mean an event, change, or occurrence which, individually or
together with any other event, change, or occurrence, has a material adverse
impact on (i) the financial position, business or results of operations or

to DBC: (i) a  ----------------- certificate signed by FFC\'s Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer (or other officer reasonably acceptable to DBC)

covenants required to be performed by FFC; and (ii) such other certificates
and documents as DBC and its counsel may reasonably request (all of the
foregoing certificates and documents being herein referred to as the "FFC
Closing Documents").   ARTICLE VIII. TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  
Section 8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time 
----------- ----------- before the Effective Time (whether before or after
the authorization, approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of DBC) as follows:   -39-    (a) Mutual Consent: This
Agreement may be terminated by mutual  -------------- consent of the parties
upon the affirmative vote of a majority of each of the Boards of Directors of
DBC and FFC, followed by written notices given to the other party.   (b)
Unilateral Action by FFC: This Agreement may be terminated 
------------------------ unilaterally by the affirmative vote of the Board of
Directors of FFC, followed by written notice given promptly to DBC, if: (i)
there has been a material breach by DBC of any representation, warranty or
material failure to comply with any covenant set forth in this Agreement and
such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice
of such breach has been given by FFC to DBC; (ii) any condition precedent to
FFC\'s obligations as set forth in Article VII of this Agreement remains
unsatisfied, through no fault of FFC, on September 30, 2001; or (iii) FFC\'s
Board of Directors makes an election provided for in Section 5.7(f)(i)
herein.   (c) Unilateral Action By DBC: This Agreement may be terminated 
------------------------ unilaterally by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Board of Directors of DBC, followed by written notice given promptly
to FFC, if: (i) there has been a material breach by FFC of any
representation, warranty or material failure to comply with any covenant set
forth in this Agreement and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after written notice of such breach has been given by DBC to FFC; (ii)
any condition precedent to DBC\'s obligations as set forth in Article VII of
this Agreement remains unsatisfied, through no fault of DBC, on September 30,
2001 or (iii) DBC\'s Board of Directors makes an election provided for in,
and subject to the conditions of, Section 5.7(f)(ii) herein.   (d) Market
Price of FFC Common Stock. (i) DBC shall have the right 
-------------------------------- to terminate this Agreement, through a
resolution adopted by its Board of Directors, if the Closing Market Price is
less than $19.50, i.e. .85 multiplied by the Starting Price (the "Floor
Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, FFC, through a resolution adopted by
its Board of Directors, shall have the option to cause DBC to amend this
Agreement (and, upon such amendment, DBC shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement) to increase the Conversion Ratio to a level,
calculated to four decimal places, equal to the Conversion Ratio multiplied
by the quotient of the Floor Price (the numerator) over the Closing Market
Price (the denominator). For example, if the Closing Market Price is $17.20
and the Floor Price is $19.50, FFC would have the option to increase
the Conversion Ratio to 1.4058 (1.24 x 19.50/17.20) in lieu of terminating
this Agreement.   (ii) FFC shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement, through a resolution adopted by its Board of Directors, if the
Closing Market Price is greater than $26.38, i.e. 1.15 multiplied by the
Starting Price (the "Ceiling Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, DBC
through a resolution adopted by its Board of Directors shall have the option
to cause FFC to amend this Agreement (and, upon such amendment, FFC shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement) to decrease the Conversion Ratio
to a level, calculated to four decimal places, equal to the Conversion Ratio
multiplied by the quotient of the Ceiling Price (the numerator) over the
Closing Market Price (the denominator). For example, if the Closing Market
Price is $28.67 and the Ceiling Price is $26.38, DBC would have the option to
decrease the Conversion Ratio to 1.1410 (1.24 x 26.38/28.67) in lieu of
terminating this Agreement.   -40-    (iii) For purposes of this Section
8.1(d), "Starting Price" shall mean $22.9375, i.e. the last sale price for
FFC Common Stock on December 26, 2000 as reported on NASDAQ.   (iv) The
Starting Price, the Closing Market Price and the other amounts above shall be
appropriately adjusted for an event described in Section 2.1(d) herein.  
Section 8.2. Effect of Termination.  ----------- ---------------------

------ Agreement under Section 8.1 herein, the Agreement shall become null

DBC, or if this Agreement is terminated by DBC by reason of a material breach

misrepresentation or breach of covenant, the breaching party (i.e., FFC or
DBC) shall be liable to the nonbreaching party for all costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the nonbreaching party in connection with the
preparation, execution and attempted consummation of this Agreement,
including the reasonable fees of its counsel, accountants, consultants and
other advisors and representatives. In no event shall either party\'s
directors, officers, shareholders, agents or representatives have
any personal liability for any misrepresentation or breach in connection with
this Agreement.   (c) Confidentiality. In the event of a termination of
this  --------------- Agreement, neither FFC nor DBC nor Drovers Bank shall
use or disclose to any other person any confidential information obtained by
it during the course of its investigation of the other party or parties,
except as may be necessary in order to establish the liability of the other
party or parties for breach as contemplated under Section 8.2(b) herein.  
Section 8.3. Amendment. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement may
