Stock (such holders collectively, the "Company Stockholders"), each share of
Company Common Stock (excluding, for avoidance of doubt, (i) Company Options,
which shall be treated as provided for in Section 3.1(c), (ii) any Dissenting
Shares, which shall be treated as provided in Section 3.3, and (iii) any
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury of the
Company or owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which shall be treated

outstanding and unexercised at such time shall vest, to the extent then-
unvested. Each Company Option that is outstanding and which has not been
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be terminated at the

(each, a "Company Optionholder" and collectively with the Company
Stockholders, the "Company Equityholders") shall be entitled to receive, in
full settlement and cancellation thereof, the applicable Option Consideration
(if any), it being understood that if the Option Consideration with respect to
any Company Option is a negative number, then the holder of such Company
Option shall not be entitled to receive any consideration in respect of such
Company Option or the termination thereof. Payments of Option Consideration
shall be made in

   

accordance with Section 3.2(d). Prior to the Effective Time, the board of

. 

 

(a)Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to an exchange
agent (the "Exchange Agent") selected by the Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate
amount (the "Funding Amount") necessary to pay to each Company Stockholder
(other than any Dissenting Stockholders) the applicable Common Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled hereunder.

 

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver to
each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal, substantially in the form of
Exhibit D (the "Transmittal Letter"), which shall specify, among other things,
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates representing Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. In the
event that, prior to the Closing Date, a Company Stockholder surrenders a
Certificate or affidavit of loss to the Exchange Agent, together with delivery
of a Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor payment at the Closing of the applicable portion
of the Common Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Following the
Closing, upon surrender of a Certificate or affidavit of loss to the Exchange
Agent, together with delivery of such Transmittal Letter, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the applicable
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment,
as soon as reasonably practicable, of the applicable portion of the Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

 

(c)Promptly following the date which is six months after the Closing Date,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent all undisbursed
Common Merger Consideration. Thereafter, each Company Stockholder may deliver
Transmittal Letters to Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and Parent shall
promptly pay, the applicable portion of the Common Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article
III.

 

(d)Each Company Optionholder shall be entitled to receive on the next payroll
payment date following the Closing, to the extent practicable and in no event
later than the second payroll date following the Closing, in exchange for the
Company Options held by such Company Optionholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, payment of the applicable

   

Option Consideration that such Company Optionholder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(c).

 

(e)If the Common Merger Consideration payable to a Company Stockholder is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the relevant
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment of such amount that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise be in proper form for transfer.

 

(f)In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Company
Stockholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in such
form and containing such substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, Parent
will pay (or cause the Exchange Agent to pay) in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable portion of the Common Merger
Consideration to be paid with respect thereto, subject to the terms and
conditions in this Article III.

 

3.3Dissenter's Rights.

 



 

(a)Any shares of Company Common Stock held by a Stockholder who has complied
with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenter's
Rights Statute"), properly exercised dissenter's rights thereunder with
respect to such holder's shares of Company Common Stock, and not effectively
withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such dissenter's
rights (such shares collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable portion of the
Common Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 3.1 hereof or any other
amounts payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3.5(d),
3.5(e) or 11.2, but the holder thereof (each a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall
only be entitled to such rights as are provided by the DGCL.

 

(b)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3(a) hereof, in the event that,
prior to the Determination Date, any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Dissenting
Stockholder's dissenter's rights with respect to such shares under the DGCL,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right
to receive the applicable portion of the Common Merger Consideration set forth
in and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, upon surrender of the
Certificate(s) formerly representing such shares, and such formerly Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to any applicable amounts otherwise payable to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3.5(d), 3.5(e) or 11.2.

 

(c)The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demand for payment,
any notice of intent to demand payment, or any other assertion of dissenter's
or appraisal rights, whether under the Dissenter's Rights Statute or otherwise
(collectively, the "Dissenter Demands") and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such Dissenter
Demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
make any payment with respect to any such Dissenter Demands or offer to settle
or settle any such Dissenter Demands, unless such payment or settlement (A) is
limited to the right to receive the applicable portion of the Common Merger
Consideration to which such Dissenting Stockholder would

   

otherwise be entitled hereunder or which is otherwise paid by the Company in
full in cash prior to the Closing Date, and (B) includes an unconditional,
irrevocable and full release of such Dissenter Demands. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to the Company's right to settle any Dissenter Demands
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, following the Closing,
to the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company (i) makes
any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any losses (including
reasonable outside attorneys' and consultants' fees, costs and expenses and
including any such reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding) in
respect of any Dissenting Shares ((i) and (ii) together, "Excess Dissenting
Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount of such
Excess Dissenting Share Payments in accordance with and subject to the terms
of Article XII hereof.

 

(d)Notwithstanding any provision of this Article III to the contrary, in the
event that, as of the Determination Date, there are any Dissenting Shares held
by a Dissenting Stockholder that does not effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Dissenting Stockholder's
dissenter's rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then
(i) any payment by Parent that would have been required to have been paid to
any such Dissenting Stockholder (assuming, for this purpose, that such
Dissenting Stockholder had not exercised dissenter's rights) under this
Agreement shall be retained by Parent and (ii) any amounts otherwise payable
to such Dissenting Stockholder in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Sections 3.5(d), 3.5(e) or 11.2 shall be payable to Parent in lieu of such
Dissenting Stockholder.

3.5Adjustment Amount

 

.

 

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 60 days thereof, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Holder
Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a calculation
of Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date ("Closing Date Net Working Capital"),
(iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company
as of the Closing ("Closing Date Indebtedness"), and (iv) a calculation of
Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company as of the Closing ("Closing Date
Cash"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), applied in a manner
consistent with the accounting principles and methodologies set forth on
Schedule 1.1(a), not taking into account any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that if there is any inconsistency between GAAP and
the principles and methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.1(a), the principles
and methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.1(a) shall apply. Following the
Closing, Parent shall provide the Holder Representative and its
representatives access to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Holder Representative
in connection with its review of the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

(b)If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing Date Cash,
it shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within 30 days after
its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the Holder
Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such
30-day period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date Cash delivered by Parent, which
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the
event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the
Holder Representative shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of 30
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing Date Cash. If, at the end
of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Ernst and
Young LLP (or such other independent accounting or financial consulting firm
of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Parent and the
Holder Representative) (the "Auditor") shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. Each of Parent and the Holder Representative shall promptly
after engagement of the Auditor provide their assertions regarding the Closing
Date

   

Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and/or Closing Date Cash and,
to the extent relevant thereto, the Closing Balance Sheet in writing to the
Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its
determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
practicable (which the Parties agree should not be later than 45 days
following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Auditor). The
Auditor shall base its determination solely on (i) the written submission of
the Parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the
extent (if any) to which the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Indebtedness and/or Closing Date Cash require adjustment (only with respect to
the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor) in order to be
determined in accordance with Section 3.5(a) (including the definitions of the
defined terms used in Section 3.5(a)). The determination of the Auditor shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The date on which Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, and Closing Date Cash are
finally determined in accordance with this Section 3.5(b) is hereinafter
referred to as the "Determination Date." All fees and expenses of the Auditor
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall
be borne between Parent, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative (and
deducted from the Holder Allocable Expense Amount), on the other, based on the
percentage which the portion of the total contested amounts not awarded to
such Party as determined by the Auditor bears to the total amounts contested
by the Parties.

 

(c)If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Aggregate
Consideration shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.5(d). If the Adjustment
Amount is a negative number, then the Aggregate Consideration shall be
decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.5(e).

 

(d)If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then (i) Parent shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) within three Business Days following the
Determination Date (x) to the Exchange Agent (for distribution to each Company
Stockholder in accordance with such Company Stockholder's Common Pro Rata
Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Adjustment Amount, multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata Percentage,
and (y) to the Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company Optionholder
in accordance with such Company Optionholder's Option Pro Rata Percentage) a
cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Adjustment Amount,
multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage, and (ii) the
Holder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and Parent
shall each, within three Business Days after the Determination Date, direct
the Escrow Agent to release (x) to the Exchange Agent (for distribution to
each Company Stockholder in accordance with such Company Stockholder's Common
Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A)
the total amount of the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, multiplied by
(B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata Percentage, and (y) to the Surviving
Corporation (for payment to each Company Optionholder in accordance with such
Company Optionholder's Option Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total amount of the funds in the Adjustment
Escrow Account, multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage.

 

(e)If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Holder Representative
(on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and Parent shall each, within three
Business Days after

   

the Determination Date, direct the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Parent from the
Adjustment Escrow Account an aggregate amount equal to the absolute value of
the Adjustment Amount and (ii) release (x) to the Exchange Agent (for
distribution to each Company Stockholder in accordance with such Company
Stockholder's Common Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to
the product of (A) the total amount of any remaining funds (if any) in the
Adjustment Escrow Account after giving effect to the payments pursuant to the
preceding clause (i), multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata
Percentage, and (y) to the Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company
Optionholder in accordance with such Company Optionholder's Option Pro Rata
Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the total
amount of any remaining funds (if any) in the Adjustment Escrow Account after
giving effect to the payments pursuant to the preceding clause (i), multiplied
by (B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage. If the available funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account are insufficient to make the payment to Parent
set forth in the preceding clause (i), the Holder Representative (on behalf of
the Company Equityholders) and Parent shall each, within three Business Days
after the Determination Date, direct the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent from
the Indemnification Escrow Account an amount equal to the amount by which the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount of funds available
in the Adjustment Escrow Account.

 

3.6Escrow of Consideration.

 

(a)On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) (the "Indemnification Escrow Amount") into
an escrow account (the "Indemnification Escrow Account") established pursuant
to the terms of an Escrow Agreement to be entered into at Closing among Holder
Representative, Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or such other escrow agent
mutually acceptable to the Parties, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"),
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Escrow
Agreement"), in order to fully support the Company Equityholders'
indemnification obligations under Article XII hereof.

 

(b)On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") into an
escrow account (the "Adjustment Escrow Account") established pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, in order to support the Company Equityholders'
payment obligations under Section 3.5(e).

 

(c)An amount equal to each Company Equityholder's Pro Rata Percentage of each
of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
deemed to have been deducted from the consideration otherwise payable to such
Company Equityholder on the Closing Date for deposit into the applicable
Escrow Account, and shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

3.7Qualified Letters of Credit.

 



 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Company Stockholder shall have the right after the Closing to cause the Escrow
Agent to distribute to such Company Stockholder an amount equal to the product
of such Company Stockholder's Common Pro Rata Percentage multiplied by the
Indemnification Escrow Amount

   

so long as (i) the amount of such distributed funds to such Company
Stockholder is greater than $500,000, and (ii) such Company Stockholder
delivers a Qualified Letter of Credit with a principal amount equal to the
amount of such distributed funds to the Escrow Agent (each such Company
Stockholder that delivers a Qualified Letter of Credit being referred to
herein as a "Credit Holder"). At any time the Escrow Agent is required to
distribute any of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to any Person other than
the Company Equityholders (other than to the Surviving Corporation on behalf
of the Company Optionholders as provided herein), the Escrow Agent shall have
an absolute and unconditional right to draw funds from each Qualified Letter
of Credit in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement based upon each
Credit Holder's Common Pro Rata Percentage, and the Escrow Agent shall
distribute such drawn amount from each Qualified Letter of Credit together
with the other requisite funds from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to
satisfy the distribution requirement. Company Stockholders shall not be
permitted to substitute a Qualified Letter of Credit for the Adjustment Escrow
Amount.

 

(b)The amount of funds that the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to draw in
respect of each Qualified Letter of Credit shall be reduced from time to time
as follows:

 

(i)if the Escrow Agent draws funds from a Qualified Letter of Credit, then the
amount of funds that the Escrow Agent is thereafter permitted to draw in
respect of such Qualified Letter of Credit shall be reduced by that amount
drawn; and

 

(ii)if the Escrow Agent distributes any portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to the Company Equityholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (including distributions to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of
the Company Optionholders as provided herein), no Credit Holder shall receive
such distribution in the form of cash, and instead such distribution shall be
paid to each Credit Holder by reducing the amount of funds that the Escrow
Agent is permitted to draw in respect of such Credit Holder's Qualified Letter
of Credit by an amount equal to the product of (x) the portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount being distributed, multiplied by (y) such Credit
Holder's Common Pro Rata Percentage.

 

(c)If any Qualified Letter of Credit (including any amended or replacement
Qualified Letter of Credit) (x) is set to terminate in accordance with its
terms on a date prior to when all of the Indemnification Escrow Amount is
distributed in accordance with Section 6(e) of the Escrow Agreement or (y)
would permit the Escrow Agent to draw more funds than the remaining amount of
funds that the Escrow Agent is then permitted to draw from such Qualified
Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, then the applicable Company Stockholder may amend or replace the
Qualified Letter of Credit then in place upon compliance with the following:

 

(i)at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the proposed effective date of
the amended or replacement Qualified Letter of Credit (which must be at least
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the termination date of the Qualified
Letter of Credit then in effect), the applicable Company Stockholder shall
deliver to Parent

   

and the Holder Representative a proposed form of amended or replacement letter
of credit with an effective date commencing at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the termination date of the Qualified Letter of Credit then in effect
and in an amount not less than the maximum amount permitted to be drawn under
the Qualified Letter of Credit that is being amended or replaced, and
certifying that such amended or replacement letter of credit meets all the
requirements of a "Qualified Letter of Credit" under this Agreement (other
than having a maturity date that is at least three Business Days after the
expiration of all Survival Expiration Dates) and requesting the confirmation
of Parent and the Holder Representative that such replacement letter of credit
is a "Qualified Letter of Credit" (the "Replacement LOC Notification"); and

 

(ii)each of Parent and the Holder Representative shall promptly and, in any
event within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of the Replacement LOC
Notification, provide written confirmation (such confirmation not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the Escrow Agent that the
proposed letter of credit is a "Qualified Letter of Credit" or its objection
to the proposed form of letter of credit setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for its objection to such proposed form; provided, that each of
Parent and the Holder Representative acknowledges and agrees to provide the
written confirmation necessary to implement an amended or replacement
Qualified Letter of Credit in accordance with this Section 3.7(c)(ii) if the
proposed form of replacement Qualified Letter of Credit (x) is issued by the
same issuing bank (provided such bank is a nationally recognized United States
banking institution having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less
than $500,000,000 and an investment grade credit rating by both Moody's and
Standard and Poor's), in substantially identical form and contains substantially
identical terms as the Qualified Letter of Credit it is replacing, except (A)
for permitted reductions in the available credit and (B) extending the
termination date or (y) meets all the requirements of a "Qualified Letter of
Credit" under this Agreement and is otherwise substantially in the form
attached to the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d)On the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the date of termination of the
terminating Qualified Letter of Credit (the "Required Draw Date"), if the
written confirmation of Parent and the Holder Representative required under
Section 2(c) has not been obtained, the Escrow Agent shall draw the full
amount of undrawn funds under such terminating Qualified Letter of Credit and
provide written confirmation thereof to Parent and the Holder Representative,
and thereafter the applicable Credit Holder shall be treated in the same
manner as the other Company Stockholders (including with respect to the right
to receive distributions in the form of cash for all distributions to Company
Equityholders from the Indemnification Escrow Amount). Once the amount of
funds the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw from a Qualified Letter of Credit
is equal to zero, the Credit Holder shall be permitted to terminate such
Qualified Letter of Credit.

 

(e)All references in this Agreement (including Section 12.4) to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall include both funds that are part of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (including any Escrow Earnings (as defined in
the Escrow Agreement) other than any Escrow Earnings that are to be
distributed as a Parent Tax Distribution (as defined in the Escrow

   

Agreement)) and the amounts which the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to draw
from Qualified Letters of Credit (taking into account any reductions of the
amount of funds the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw pursuant to Section
3.7(c)), at the applicable time. All references in this Agreement to
distributions, releases and other similar terms with respect to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall include both (i) payments of cash from the
Indemnification Escrow Account and (ii) any reductions of the amount of funds
the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw pursuant to Section 3.7(c). For
purposes of this Section 3.7, distributions of any of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount to the Holder Representative to advance or reimburse expenses of
the Holder Representative, acting in its capacity as such, shall not be deemed
to be a distribution to a Company Equityholder.

 

3.8Outstanding Company Expenses

 

. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent a
written report setting forth a list of the following fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation and

to be paid to the Holder Representative and used for payment of expenses
incurred in its capacity as the Holder Representative (such amount, the
"Holder Allocable Expense Amount") (clauses (a)-(d) collectively, the
"Outstanding Company Expenses"). On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay to
such third parties as are directed by the Company (including the Rabbi Trusts,
if appropriate), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the

Transitioning Executive Agreements (including the employer portion of any
employment taxes payable in respect of all such payments) shall be paid at the
times provided in such agreements and in accordance with the Rabbi Trusts
(where applicable) and applicable Law. No amount shall be included on the

avoidance of doubt, no amounts payable in connection with the repayment of the
Funded Debt or any amounts in connection with any Financing or Alternative
Financing shall be included in the Outstanding Company Expenses.

Merger Sub, shall apply such cash to repay the Funded Debt, and (c) the
Company shall cause the applicable agent under the Credit Agreement to deliver
to Parent (i) a pay-off letter, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, evidencing the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Credit
Agreement (other than any indemnity obligation for unasserted claims that by
its terms survives the termination of the Credit Agreement) upon receipt of
the amounts set forth in such pay-off letter and (ii) a release in customary
form concurrently with the payment of amounts specified in the pay-off letter
referred to in clause (i) above of all Liens with respect to the capital
stock, property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the
Credit Agreement.

. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax laws. If
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation so withholds (or
causes to be withheld) any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding is made. To the extent that Parent
becomes aware of any withholding Taxes applicable to the payment of the Common
Merger Consideration, Parent shall (i) provide prompt written notice to the
Company and the Holder Representative of the amount of such Tax, and (ii)
consult with the Company and the Holder Representative in good faith as to the
nature of the Tax and the basis upon which such withholding is required.

Consideration under this Agreement.

programs or policies maintained or sponsored by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, or
may have, any liability or obligation, contingent or otherwise. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any formal, legally binding plan or
commitment to create any material additional plan or materially modify or
change any existing Benefit Plan that would affect any current or former
employee, director or other service provider of or to the Company or any of

has received a favorable determination or opinion letter relating to the most
recently completed IRS remedial amendment period cycle applicable thereto and
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or require the
filing of a submission under the IRS's employee plans compliance resolution
system ("EPCRS") or the taking of other corrective action pursuant to EPCRS in
order to maintain such qualified status. All contributions required to have
been made under the terms of each Benefit Plan or pursuant to ERISA or the

Title IV of ERISA (including withdrawal liability) has been incurred by the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Controlled Group Member that has
not been satisfied in full,

   

and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the

contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control,

material respects with the group health plan continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of
ERISA or similar state law.

 

(i)Except for the Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule 4.16(i), no Benefit Plan
exists that, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)), would result in or

service provider of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becoming
entitled to severance pay or benefits or any similar payment or benefit, (ii)
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of, or an increase in the
amount of, any compensation due to any current or former employee, director or
other service provider of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or

compensation of any current or former employee, director or other service
provider of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to reimburse or
gross-up any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxes, penalties, or interest or assessments
imposed under or with respect to Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

(j)Each Benefit Plan that provides deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code complies in all material respects with Section 409A(a)(2)-(4)
of the Code (and has so complied for the entire period during which Section
409A(a)(2)-(4) of the Code has applied to such Benefit Plan). No Company
Option has a per share exercise price that is less than the fair market value
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of a share of Company Common
Stock on the date of grant of the Company Option. None of the transactions
contemplated by

   

this Agreement or any other agreement referred to in this Agreement will
constitute or result in a violation in any material respect of Section
409A(a)(2)-(4) of the Code.

 

(k)Except as would not reasonably be expected to give rise to material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Person who performs
services for the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has been, and is,
properly classified by the Company or such Subsidiary as an employee or
independent contractor.

rights generally and the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with

contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.6Financial Ability

 

. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has received an executed debt
commitment letter dated the date hereof (including all exhibits and
attachments thereto and as the same may be amended and restated from time to
time prior to the Closing Date, the "Debt Commitment Letter") from Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated, pursuant to which the Financing Sources parties thereto
have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub the Financing in cash in the aggregate amount
set forth in the

   

Debt Commitment Letter. A true and complete copy of the fully executed Debt
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof has been provided to the
Company. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees required
by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof. As of
the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is valid and in full force and

any term or condition that could affect the initial funding of the Financing
or the availability of the Financing. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, together with the available cash
on hand at Parent on the Closing Date, will be sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to make all Closing Date Payments and to pay all
fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, at and
immediately after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that both the
fair value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that
the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount
required to pay its probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or
become due), (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage
in its business and (c) will not have incurred and does not plan to incur
debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

warranty, express or implied, regarding the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and the Company Disclosure Schedules or (b) makes or shall be deemed
to have made hereunder any

   

representations or warranties, express or implied, at law or in equity, of any
kind or nature whatsoever concerning or as to the accuracy or completeness of
any projections, budgets, forecasts or other forward-looking financial
information concerning the future revenue, income, profit or other financial
results of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries. Parent and

and of record, all of the outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub, free and
clear of all Liens (other than any Liens created pursuant to the Financing).

securities, or (b) has the power, direct or indirect, whether or not

including legal and accounting, of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries
to provide to Parent, at Parent's sole expense, such reasonable cooperation in

be delivered in connection with the Financing), (iv) (A) delivering a
customary payoff letter, executed by each party thereto, with respect to the
Funded Debt, (B) assisting with the preparation of such documentation as may

unless the conditions set forth in Article IX are satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing)
prior to May 15, 2015, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related
statement of income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015 (the "Required Financial Information") and
(y) such other financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
and the Company's Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent on or
prior to March 31, 2015 and that is customarily needed for financings of the
type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, other than financial
statements (except for the financial statements described in clause (x) above)
and any information the disclosure of which is restricted by applicable Law,
national security requirements or other confidentiality obligation (together
with the Required Financial Information, the "Required Information"), and (vi)
using commercially reasonable efforts to

   

satisfy the Financing Conditions set forth in paragraph 3 of Exhibit D to the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions is
within the control of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that if the Company believes in good faith that it has
delivered the Required Information to Parent, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such
delivery), in which case the Required Information will be deemed to have been
delivered to Parent (and the Financing Sources that are a party to the Debt
Commitment Letter on the date hereof) at the time specified in such notice
unless the Parent believes in good faith that the Company has not completed
the delivery of the Required Information and, within two Business Days after
the delivery of such notice, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect stating with specificity what Required Information has not been
delivered; provided further, that the Company shall only be obligated under
this Section 6.4(a) to deliver such financial statements and information to
the extent they may be reasonably obtained from the books and records of the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries without undue effort or expense and in
no event shall the Required Financial Information be deemed to include or
shall the Company otherwise be required to provide pro forma financial
statements or pro forma adjustments related to the Financing; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be required to provide, or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this Section 6.4(a) that: (A)
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries; (B) causes any representation or warranty of the
Company in this Agreement to be breached; (C) causes any closing condition set
forth in Article IX to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of
this Agreement or any Contract to which the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries is a party; or (D) (without limiting the obligation set forth in
Section 6.4(a)(iv) above) requires the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, managers or employees to
execute and deliver or enter into, or perform, any agreement, including any
commitment letter and any Debt Documents with respect to the Financing prior
to the Closing, and the Board shall not be required to adopt resolutions
approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Financing is obtained prior to the Closing. In no event shall the Company be
in breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any financial or
other information pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) that is not currently
readily available to the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries on the date
hereof or is not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of the
Company or the Company's Subsidiaries at the time requested by Parent or for
the failure to obtain review of any financial or other information by its
accountants.

 

(b)In no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company be required
to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any liability (including due to
any act or omission by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives) or expense
in connection with assisting Parent in arranging the Financing or as a result
of any information provided by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
representatives in connection therewith. Parent shall (i) promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all out-of- pocket costs
incurred in good faith by the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing or providing any of the information utilized

   

in connection therewith other than any Losses to the extent resulting from
gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by
any of the foregoing.

 

(c)To the extent that this Section 6.4 requires the Company's cooperation with
respect to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter or relating to the Financing, the Company shall be deemed to
have complied with this Section 6.4 for purposes of Article IX of this
Agreement if the Company has provided Parent with the assistance required
under this Section 6.4 with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth
in Section 9.2(b), as it applies to the Company's obligations under this
Section 6.4, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing has not been
obtained primarily as a result of the Company's material breach of its
obligations under this Section 6.4, which breach is a consequence of an act or
failure to act by the Company with the knowledge that the taking of such act
or failure to act would reasonably be expected to cause such breach.

 

6.5Stockholder Approval

 

. Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and, in any
event, no later than 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the first Business Day
following the date hereof, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the DGCL and the Company's Governing Documents to solicit and
obtain the Stockholder Approval by means of written consent (the
"Stockholders' Consent"). The Company's obligation to seek the Stockholder
Approval in accordance with this Section 6.5 shall not be limited by or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. Promptly following receipt of the
Stockholders' Consent, the Company shall deliver a copy of such Stockholders'
Consent to Parent.

 

6.6No Solicitation

 

. 

 

(a)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or
permit any of its Representatives directly or indirectly to, (i) solicit,
initiate, seek, entertain or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
solicit, initiate, seek, entertain or knowingly encourage any inquiries or
communications relating to, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes or may constitute, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations relating to, any Acquisition Proposal with any
person other than Parent, (iii) furnish to any person other than Parent any
information that the Company believes or should reasonably know would be used
for the purposes of formulating any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal
or offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any
effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) accept any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(whether written or oral) providing for the consummation of any transaction
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b)As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours,
after any officer or director of the Company receives any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
including (i) the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) a copy of all written materials provided by
such Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry

summary, if it is not in writing, of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the
Company shall continue to keep Parent promptly informed (in any event on a
daily basis) of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (including, but not limited to, notice of all material
amendments or developments with respect thereto).

 

(c)The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

6.7Notice of Certain Events; Supplemental Disclosure.

 

(a)The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of, and
contemporaneously shall provide Parent with true and complete copies of, any
and all information or documents in the Company's possession (to the extent
permitted to do so under applicable Law and Contract, and without materially
prejudicing attorney-client or similar privilege) relating to any event,
transaction or circumstance, as soon as practicable after it becomes known to
the Company, occurring on or after the date of this Agreement (except for
changes or developments permitted or contemplated by this Agreement) that
renders, or shall render, untrue in any material respect or causes, or shall
cause, the breach in any material respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company under this Agreement as if the same were
made on or as of the date of such event, transaction or circumstance;
provided, however, that for purposes of Article XII, the failure of the
Company to notify Parent with respect to any event, transaction or
circumstance that renders untrue in any material respect or causes the breach
in any material respect of any representation or warranty of the Company under
this Agreement shall not give rise to or form the basis of any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(ii), but shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder of the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i).

 

(b)Until the date falling three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) from time to time to
supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedules with (i) a list of
actions taken by the Company that are permitted by the terms of this Agreement
or to which Parent has consented in writing, including in each case pursuant
to Section 6.1, and the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
modified, supplemented and amended for all purposes hereunder to include such
items and (ii) a list of any other matters first arising after the date
hereof; provided that such other matters (x) shall not be deemed to have cured
any breach of representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Article IX have been
satisfied or whether or not Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i), and (y) shall not be deemed to cure
any breach of representation or warranty of the Company for purposes of
Article XII.

 

6.8Management Agreements and Stockholders Agreements

 

. The Company shall cause the Management Agreements and the Stockholders
Agreements to terminate upon the occurrence of, or prior to, the Closing, with
no liability for any payment, fee or penalty payable by Parent, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such termination, except for the
payment of accrued fees and expenses under the terms of the Management

   

Agreements and which are included as current liabilities in the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital as determined in accordance with Section 3.5.

with applicable accounting procedures with respect to the audited Financial
Statements to meet the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act
and Rule 3‑05 and Article 11 promulgated thereunder, including requesting that
its accountants cooperate with Parent, and Parent shall promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company in undertaking the foregoing; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the audited
Financial Statements to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the
Securities Act or Rule 3‑05 or Article 11 promulgated thereunder, shall not be
deemed to constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement.

7.2Indemnification and Insurance Matters

 

.

Closing Date, Parent agrees that it shall and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or Losses incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such Person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, (i)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (x)
to maintain for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time
provisions in its Governing Documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors,
employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the Governing Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (y) for a
period of not less than six years from the Closing Date, not to amend, repeal
or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect
the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by
Law and (ii) Parent agrees that any indemnification and advancement of
expenses available to any current or former director of the Company or its
Subsidiaries by virtue of such current or former director's service as a
partner or employee of any investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company

Director") shall be secondary to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses to be provided by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.2 and that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (A) shall be the primary indemnitors of first
resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this Section 7.2, (B) shall be fully
responsible for the advancement of all expenses and the payment of all Losses
with respect to Sponsor Directors which are addressed by this Section 7.2 to
the extent provided in this Section 7.2 and (C) shall not make any claim for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any
other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with respect to any
matter addressed by this Section 7.2. Parent shall

   

assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
Section 7.2.

 

(b)Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause directors' and officers'
liability coverage for those Persons who are currently covered by the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies to be extended under the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms not
materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, any
insurance required to be maintained under this Section 7.2 shall be continued
in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof; provided,
however, that if such "tail" policy is not available at a cost not greater
than two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof under the Company's existing policies (the "Insurance Cap"), then the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain only as much
coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such annual
premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the
event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.2.

 

7.3Employment Matters

 

.

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor the employment, severance, consulting and similar
agreements listed in Schedule 4.16(a) hereto; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending
or terminating any such agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable
law.

 

(b)Parent shall cause the employee benefit plans of Parent or any of its
Affiliates ("Parent Group Plans") that cover the employees of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries who continue in the employ of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the Closing Date
(the "Continuing Employees") at any time after the Closing Date to credit
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor
employer, as service with Parent or its Affiliates for purposes of (i)
accruing annual comprehensive leave time under the Parent Group Plan that
provides comprehensive leave time and determining the amount of severance
benefits to which Continuing Employees are entitled under any applicable
Parent Group Plan that provides severance benefits, subject the terms of such
plans, and (ii) eligibility and vesting under the Parent Group Plans, in each
case to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the corresponding Benefit Plans, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits. Parent shall, as

   

of immediately following the Closing Date, credit to each Continuing Employee
under the applicable comprehensive leave program of Parent all unused paid
time off credited to such Continuing Employee under the paid time off programs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (including, without
limitation, accrued and unused vacation and permitted and unused sick,
bereavement and similar leave) and shall not take any actions that adversely
affect any such Continuing Employees (or their future accrual of paid time off
or other leave time) as a result of such credit (provided that for sake of
clarity such accrued and unused vacation and sick, bereavement and similar
leave shall be taken into account for purposes of applying any maximum accrual
or carryover limits under the comprehensive leave program of the Parent).

 

(c)Following the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent to allow Parent to (i) arrange and
conduct for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, an open enrollment
period for Parent Group Plans (to the extent such plans will be made available
to such employees and employee orientation sessions, (ii) meet with employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (either individually or in groups) outside
of scheduled work hours and (iii) enter into employee retention letter
agreements, at Parent's expense, with the employees identified by Parent by
written letter or memorandum delivered to the Company prior to the execution
of this Agreement (provided, for the sake of clarity, Parent shall not be
required to enter into employee retention letter agreements with all such
employees); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) all meetings,
orientation sessions and other interactions between employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and employees or other representatives of Parent or any
of its Affiliates shall be (x) scheduled at a time and location, and (y) cover
subject matters, in each case, mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent
in advance, and a representative of the Company shall in all instances be
entitled to attend such meetings and interactions, and (B) no presentations,
meeting materials or other communications from Parent or any of its Affiliates
(or any of their respective representatives) shall be provided to employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries without prior review and approval by the
Company.

 

(d)Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Parent Group Plans to (i) waive or cause to be waived for each Continuing
Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment
requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent or any of
its Affiliates applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable (or was
previously satisfied by) to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the
welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give or cause to
be given full credit under the welfare plans of Parent and its Affiliates
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-
payments, co-insurance and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the
same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had
been a single continuous employer.

 

(e)Following the date hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all such necessary actions reasonably requested by Parent to
(i) prepare the EPP to be merged with and into the Savings Plan effective as
soon as reasonably practicable following

   

the Closing Date in accordance with applicable requirements under the Code and
(ii) allow participants and beneficiaries in the EPP to elect to have their
account balances under the EPP effective after the date of such merger to be
invested in the investment options available to participants in the Savings
Plan.

 

(f)On or prior to the first payroll date following the end of the Company's
fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall
make contributions to the accounts of the eligible participants in the Savings
Plan and the EPP or otherwise provide non-forfeitable, cash bonus payments to
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, will be in addition to cash bonuses paid in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice) in an aggregate amount equal
to the Accrued Employer Contribution. To the extent the amount of the actual
contributions (or bonus payments) made by the Surviving Corporation on or
prior to the first payroll date following the end of the Company's fiscal year
in which the Closing Date occurs are less than the Accrued Employer
Contribution, the excess of the Accrued Employer Contribution over such actual
contributions (or bonus payments) will be delivered by Parent as follows: (x)
to the Exchange Agent (for distribution to each Company Stockholder in
accordance with such Company Stockholder's Common Pro Rata Percentage) a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the amount of such excess,
multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata Percentage, and (y) to the
Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company Optionholder in accordance
with such Company Optionholder's Option Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in
an amount equal to the product of (A) the amount of such excess, multiplied by
(B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage.

 

(g)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all necessary actions (including obtaining any required
waivers or consents from each person who is a "disqualified individual" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 ("Disqualified Individual")
with respect to the Company) to submit for approval by the stockholders of the
Company, in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the
final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, the right of each such
Disqualified Individual to receive or retain, as applicable, that portion of
any payments and benefits (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) that, together with any other payments and benefits the Disqualified
Individual may become entitled to receive that would be considered "parachute
payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, exceeds 299% of such
Disqualified Individual's "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of
the Code). All documents, including but not limited to waivers and stockholder
disclosure documents, to be executed, entered into, adopted, or distributed by
the Company in connection with complying with this Section 7.3(g) shall be
subject to Parent's prior review (and shall be provided to Parent at least
five days before being executed, entered into, adopted, or distributed) and
the Company shall reflect in such documents any changes or comments reasonably
requested by Parent prior to executing, entering into, adopting or
distribution such documents. Except for (i) agreements to which the Company is
a party and (ii) retention letter agreements entered into in accordance with
Section 7.3(c) that have been provided to the Company at least ten Business
Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall not enter into any Contracts or other
arrangement that could entitle any Disqualified Individual to receive payments
or benefits that could be considered "parachute payments" under Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code.

   

(h)The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.3 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties. This Agreement
is not intended by the Parties to, and nothing in this Section 7.3 or
otherwise in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall, (i) constitute
an amendment to any Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates to maintain any particular compensation or
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, (iii) create any obligation of
the Parties with respect to any Parent Group Plan or Benefit Plan, or (iv)
confer on any Continuing Employee or any other Person (other than the Parties)
any rights or remedies (including third-party beneficiary rights).

 

7.4Financing

 

. 

 

(a)Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, as promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain (including for the Company or its Subsidiaries) the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and using
commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as possible, (a) satisfy, or
cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all conditions to Parent and/or
Merger Sub obtaining (including for the Company or its Subsidiaries) the
Financing set forth therein, (b) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related flex provisions) or on other
terms that are (x) acceptable to the Financing Sources and (y) in the
aggregate not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and/or
Merger Sub, (c) cause its senior management and of its other Affiliates, if
applicable, to cooperate with the marketing and/or syndication efforts of the
Financing Sources for all of the Financing, (d) timely prepare the necessary
information memoranda or other offering documents or marketing materials with
respect to the Financing, (e) commence the marketing and/or syndication
activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as
practicable, and (f) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. If any
portion of the Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become,
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (after taking into account flex terms), Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain
(including for the Company or its Subsidiaries) alternative financing,
including from alternative sources, on terms in the aggregate not materially
less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter in an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable
portion of the Financing ("Alternative Financing") to the extent necessary to
make the representations and warranties in Section 5.6 to be true and correct
in all material respects as of the Closing Date as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and the provisions of this Section 7.4,
Section 5.6, Section 13.3, Section 13.4, Section 13.6, Section 13.14 and
Section 13.15 shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the
purposes of this Section 7.4, Section 6.4, Section 13.4 and Section 13.14, all
references to the Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative
Financing, all references to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt
Documents shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing
and all references to the Financing Sources shall include the Persons
providing or arranging the Alternative Financing (and other applicable Persons
consistent with the definition of the term "Financing Sources". Parent and
Merger Sub shall each (A) comply in all material respects with the Debt
Commitment Letter and each of the Debt Documents, (B) enforce in all material
respects its rights under each Debt Document and (C) not permit, without

   

the prior written consent of the Company, any material amendment or
modification to be made to any Debt Document or the fee letter referred to in
the Debt Commitment Letter that (individually or in the aggregate with any
other amendments, modifications or waivers) would reasonably be expected to
impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand
any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing, (II) make
the funding of any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any condition
to obtaining any portion of the Financing) less likely to occur or (III)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against any other party to any Debt Document, the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Merger
Sub each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
Alternative Financing, is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
Alternative Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article IX.

 

(b)Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in breach or default) by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document of which Parent
becomes aware, (ii) if and when Parent becomes aware that any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter may not be available for
the purposes of the Financing, (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (x) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or other Debt Document or (y) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
other Debt Document (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary
course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or the Debt
Documents), (iv) if for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it or
Merger Sub will not be able to obtain (including for the Company or its
Subsidiaries) any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner and
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related flex terms) or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (such
definitive agreements related to the Financing, collectively, with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the "Debt Documents") and (v) of any expiration or
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document. The failure
to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.4(b) shall not result in the
failure of a condition under Section 9.3(b) or a breach by Parent of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.5Notice of Certain Events

 

. Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of, and
contemporaneously shall provide the Company with true and complete copies of,
any and all information or documents in Parent's possession (to the extent
permitted to do so under applicable Law and Contract, and without prejudicing
attorney-client or similar privilege) relating to any event, transaction or
circumstance, as soon as practicable after it becomes known to Parent,
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement (except for changes or
developments permitted or contemplated by this Agreement) that renders, or
shall render, untrue in any material respect or causes, or shall cause, the
breach in any material respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement as if the same were
made on or as of the date of such event, transaction or circumstance;

   

provided, however, that the failure of Parent to comply with this Section 7.5
shall not subject Parent or Merger Sub to any liability hereunder for covenant
breach as a result of a failure to provide notice hereunder with respect to
any representation or warranty.

 

7.6Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records

 

. From and after the Closing, Parent will make or cause to be made available
to the Holder Representative and its agents, representatives and advisors all
books, records and documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the
reasonable assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and
documents) during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary for
(a) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of or
defending or prosecuting any Action, (b) preparing reports to equityholders
and Governmental Authorities or (c) insurance, Tax or accounting matters,
including preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided
for under this Agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that access to such
books, records, documents and employees will not unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or
violate applicable Law and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries incurred in connection therewith
will be paid by the Holder Representative. Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve all such books,
records and documents for the greater of (i) five (5) years after the Closing
Date or (ii) any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the
same may be extended.

 

Article VIII. 
JOINT COVENANTS

 

8.1Support of Transaction

 

. Without limiting any covenant contained in Article VI or Article VII,
including the obligations of Parent with respect to the notifications,
filings, reaffirmations and applications as described in Section 7.1, which
obligations shall control to the extent of any conflict with the succeeding
provisions of this Section 8.1, Parent and the Company shall each, and shall
each cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best efforts
to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement
such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties
that any of Parent, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required
to obtain in order to consummate the Merger, and (c) take such other action as
may reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to
satisfy the conditions of Article IX or otherwise to comply with this
Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any third
party expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with
obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with the consummation of the Merger.

 

8.2Tax Matters

 

.

 

(a)Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary,
stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and
additions to any such Taxes)

   

("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Company Equityholders,
and Parent and the Holder Representative shall reasonably cooperate in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

 

(b)Tax Claims. 

 

(i)Parent shall notify Holder Representative promptly in writing of any audit,
examination or other claim relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that may give rise to a claim for indemnification under Section
12.2(a) (a "Tax Claim"); provided, however, that the failure to give such
prompt notice shall not affect any rights or obligations of the Company
Equityholders, except to the extent the Company Equityholders have actually
been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(ii)The Holder Representative shall have the exclusive right to control any
and all Tax Claims that relate solely to Tax periods that end on or before the
Closing Date and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Claim; provided, however, that (A) the Holder Representative shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Claim, (B) Parent may at its own
expense participate in the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, and (C) the
Holder Representative shall not settle, resolve or close any such Tax Claim in
a manner that would result in an increase in the Taxes of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in a Post-Closing Tax Period or reduction in
asset Tax basis, Tax net operating loss carryforward or other Tax attribute
without the written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Holder Representative and Parent, each
at its own expense, shall jointly control all proceedings with respect to any
Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period. If the Holder Representative fails
to notify Parent of the Holder Representative's intent to assume the defense
of any Tax Claim that the Holder Representative is entitled to control and
defend pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(ii) within fifteen (15) days of receipt
of notice thereof, Parent, at its own expense but subject to the
indemnification rights in this Agreement, shall thereupon have the right to
undertake the control, defense and settlement of such Tax Claim; provided,
however, that (x) Parent shall keep the Holder Representative reasonably
informed of the status of such Tax Claim, (y) the Holder Representative may
participate in the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, and (z) Parent
shall not settle, resolve or close any such Tax Claim without the written
consent of the Holder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(c)Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare or cause the Surviving Corporation to
prepare, in a manner consistent with past practices (except as required by
applicable Law), and timely file, or cause the Surviving Corporation to timely
file, all Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries that
are filed after the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, the Holder
Representative shall pay or cause the Company Equityholders to pay or
reimburse Parent or the Surviving Corporation for all documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by

   

Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the preparation of Tax
Returns of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, except to the extent that they were included as current
liabilities in calculating Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally
determined in accordance with Section 3.5(b)). Parent shall deliver or cause
to be delivered each Tax Return described in the preceding sentence that is
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Straddle Period) to Holder Representative for its review and comment at least
30 days prior to the due date for filing any income Tax Return and 10 days
prior to the due date for filing any non-income Tax Return, and Parent shall
incorporate Holder Representative's reasonable comments. Parent shall not
file or cause to be filed any Tax Return subject to this Section 8.2(c)
without the prior written consent of Holder Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding
the preceding two sentences, if the applicable Tax Return is not an income Tax
Return, Parent may elect not to provide such non-income Tax Return to Holder
Representative for review and comment and to file or cause to be filed such
non-income Tax Return without Holder Representative's consent, provided that
if Parent does not obtain such consent from Holder Representative in
accordance with the preceding two sentences, then Parent shall be deemed to
have waived, on behalf of the Parent Indemnified Parties, any right to be
indemnified under Section 12.2(a) of this Agreement with respect to such Tax
Return or any Taxes or other Losses arising out of such Tax Return, including
Taxes or Losses arising out of any Tax Return in any jurisdiction as a result
of any position taken on such Tax Return. For purposes of this Section
8.2(c), the Parties shall treat the taxable year of the Company and/or any of
its applicable Subsidiaries as ending as of the Closing Date where required
or allowable under applicable Law, and income Tax items required to be
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)
shall be allocated to the period ending on the Closing Date in accordance with
such applicable Law based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of
the day on the Closing Date.

 

(d)Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, including Article
XII, in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed equal to (A) in the case of real or personal property Taxes or
other similar Taxes imposed on an ad valorem basis, the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period, (B) in the case of any Taxes based upon or measured
by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, a
proportionate amount of such Taxes computed by reference to the level of such
items on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the timing of the
Closing Date in relation to the relevant Straddle Period and (C) in the case
of any other Taxes, the amount of Taxes that would be payable based on an
interim closing of the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end
of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date; provided, that, exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as
depreciation) shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis.

 

(e)Tax Refunds. Except to the extent taken into account in determining
Closing Date Net Working Capital, any (i) Tax refund (including any interest
in respect thereof) received or applied for by any of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the 36-month anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) amounts creditable against a Tax for a Post-

   

Closing Tax Period to which any of Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries becomes entitled prior to the 36-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, in each case, that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Company
Equityholders. Parent shall pay to the Holder Representative (for
distribution to the Company Equityholders in the same manner as set forth in
the last sentence of Section 11.2 with respect to the Holder Allocable Expense
Amount) any such refund or the amount of any such amount credited against Tax
within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto, net of any expenses
incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
seeking or securing such refund or amount credited against Tax; provided,
however, that such refunds or amounts credited against Tax shall not include
any refunds or amounts attributable to the carryback of any credit, net
operating loss, capital loss deduction or other similar Tax attribute arising
in a Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date. Parent shall provide the
Holder Representative with written notice of the availability of any such
refund or credit subject to this Section 8.2(e) that is has knowledge of, and
upon the written request of the Holder Representative, Parent shall take
appropriate action to obtain such refund or credit. Nothing in this Section
8.2(e) shall be construed to limit or restrict, or to require any payment by
Parent as a result of, the claiming in a Post-Closing Tax Period of any
deduction or credit relating to any Tax basis, Tax net operating loss
carryforward or other Tax attribute that arose in or relates to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period other than a refund of Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is credited or offset against a Tax liability relating to a Post-
Closing Tax Period.

 

(f)Cooperation. After the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Holder
Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 8.2(c) and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes (including any Tax Claim). Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to execute Tax Returns and to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of any applicable statute
of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof), (ii) allow the
Holder Representative and its representatives at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as such party may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours at such party's
expense, and (iii) give the Holder Representative reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the Holder Representative so requests, shall allow the Holder
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 

(g)Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, (i) file an
amended Tax Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of
limitations, relating to Taxes with respect to the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) take any action on the
Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business, which action could
increase the amount of

   

Losses subject to indemnification under Section 12.2(a) or reduce the Common
Merger Consideration or (iii) make any election under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the Merger, in each case, without the prior written consent of
the Holder Representative, which consent in the case of clause (i) shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, that nothing in
clause (i) of this Section 8.2(g) shall be construed to limit or restrict the
claiming in a Post-Closing Tax Period of any deduction or credit relating to
any Tax basis, Tax net operating loss carryforward or other Tax attribute that
arose in or relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(h)For clarification and not in limitation of the definition of "Losses" in
Section 1.1, Losses shall include any loss of, or inability to claim, a Tax
deduction after the Closing Date as a result of a reduction in asset Tax
basis, Tax net operating loss carryforwards or other Tax attribute relating to
a breach of a representation in Section 4.15.

 

In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 8.2 and
any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 8.2 shall control.

 

8.3Additional Required Notices.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company, and, as may be required by the Defense Security Service (DSS) of
the United States Department of Defense or by another Cognizant Security
Agency (CSA), as defined in the National Industrial Security Program Manual
(NISPOM), with authority over any of the facility and personnel security
clearances granted by any Governmental Authority to the Company or to any of
the Company's Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub and any "affiliate" thereof (as
defined in Department of Defense Form SF328), will prepare and submit to DSS
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, to any other Cognizant Security
Agency with authority over any of the facility and personnel security
clearances granted by any Governmental Authority to the Company or to any of
the Company's Subsidiaries one or more notifications under the National
Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).

 

8.4Cooperation; Consents; Further Assurances.

 

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy or
cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set forth in
Article IX, as applicable to each of them. The Company shall, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all
approvals, consents, permissions, waivers, authorizations and to provide all
notices set forth on Schedule 4.6; provided, however, that none of the Company
or any of the Company's Subsidiaries shall be required to make any payments to
third parties, commence litigation or suffer any material burden in connection
with obtaining any such approvals, consents, permissions, waivers or
authorizations.

speak as to an earlier date, which representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in all material respects at and as of such date, and (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
other than the Parent Fundamental Representations (without giving effect to
any materiality qualification therein), shall be true and correct as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as if made anew at and as of the
Closing Date, except with respect to representations and warranties which
speak as to an earlier date, which representations and warranties shall be
true and correct at and as of such date, except for, in each case, any

   

inaccuracy or omission that would not reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)Each of the covenants of Parent to be performed as of or prior to the
Closing shall have been performed in all material respects.

 

(c)Parent shall have delivered to the Company and the Holder Representative a
certificate signed by an officer of Parent, dated the Closing Date, certifying
that the conditions specified in Section 9.3(a) and Section 9.3(b) have been
fulfilled.

 

(d)The Company and the Holder Representative shall have received the Escrow
Agreement duly executed by the Escrow Agent and Parent.

 

9.4Frustration of Closing Conditions

 

. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in this Article IX to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such Party's failure to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

Article X. 
TERMINATION

 

10.1Termination

 

. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned prior to the Closing:

 

(a)by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

Company Breach"), except that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable
by the Company, then, for a period of up to 30 days (or any shorter period of
the time that remains between the date Parent provides written notice of such
violation or breach and the End Date) after receipt by the Company of written
notice from Parent of such breach (the "Company Cure Period"), such
termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is not cured within the
Company Cure Period, (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before June 29,
2015 (the "End Date"); provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under subsection (i) or (ii) of this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available if

the case of subsection (ii) of this Section 10.1(b), if Parent's or Merger
Sub's failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
End Date, or (iii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable
Governmental Order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(b)(iii) shall not be available if Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in or causes such permanent enjoinment or
prohibition of the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or if Parent or Merger Sub is otherwise in material breach or default of its
obligations hereunder; or

   

(c)by written notice to Parent from the Company if (i) there is any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in
Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.3(b) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a
"Terminating Parent Breach"), except that, if any such Terminating Parent
Breach is curable by Parent, then, for a period of up to 30 days (or any
shorter period of the time that remains between the date Parent provides
written notice of such violation or breach and the End Date) after receipt by
Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach (the "Parent Cure
Period"), such termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall
become effective only if the Terminating Parent Breach is not cured within the
Parent Cure Period, (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the End
Date; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under subsection
(i) or (ii) of this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available if the Company is

obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the End Date, or (iii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is permanently enjoined
or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable Governmental Order of a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(iii) shall not be
available if the Company's breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in or causes such permanent enjoinment or prohibition of the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or if the Company is otherwise in
material breach or default of its obligations hereunder.

 

10.2Effect of Termination

 

. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 10.2, in the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of
any Party or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders;
provided, however, that none of the Parties shall be released from any Losses
resulting from any material breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the provisions of
Sections 10.2, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.13, 13.15 and Article XI and the
indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in
Section 6.4 (collectively, the "Surviving Provisions") and the Confidentiality
Agreement, and any other Section or Article of this Agreement referenced in
the Surviving Provisions which are required to survive in order to give
appropriate effect to the Surviving Provisions, shall in each case survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

Article XI. 
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 

11.1Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative

 

. The Parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative
to act on behalf of the Company Equityholders for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein (the "Holder Representative"). The Parties have designated
Leonard Green and Partners, L.P. as the initial Holder Representative, and
approval of this Agreement by the Company Equityholders shall constitute
ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder Representative may
resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be removed by the vote
of the Company Equityholders which collectively hold at such time (or
following the Closing, held immediately prior to the Effective Time) a Pro
Rata Percentage of more than fifty percent (50%) (the "Majority
Equityholders"). In the event that a Holder

   

Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Equityholders, such appointment to
become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative. 

 

11.2Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability

 

. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to
act on behalf of the Company Equityholders, except as expressly provided
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to, (a) expend
the Holder Allocable Expense Amount, (b) after the Closing, negotiate and
enter into amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on
behalf of the Company Equityholders, (c) exercise on behalf of the Company
Equityholders all rights granted to the Holder Representative under Sections
3.5 and 8.2, and (d) with respect to any Indemnification Claim made pursuant
to Section 12.2(a), exercise all rights granted to the Indemnitor under
Article XII (subject to paragraph (d) of Section 12.3). The Holder
Representative shall have no liability to Parent, the Company (and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any Company Equityholder
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (except to Company Equityholders for those actions
arising out of the Holder Representative's bad faith or willful misconduct).
The Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any
directions received from the Majority Equityholders; provided, however, that
the Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction,
and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the
Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds
delivered to it under Section 3.8 of this Agreement and/or has been provided
with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of
the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Holder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action.
The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts
and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from funds paid to it
under Section 3.8 of this Agreement, released from the Escrow Accounts for the
benefit of the Company Equityholders and/or otherwise received by it in its
capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall
be entitled to indemnification (i) first, from funds paid to it under Section
3.8 of this Agreement, and (ii) second, from the Company Equityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, against any loss,
liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the
Holder Representative's bad faith or willful misconduct), including the costs
and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the
Holder Allocable Expense Amount exceed the amount actually incurred by the
Holder Representative in its capacity as such upon the final release of funds
from the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
the Holder Representative shall deliver (x) to the Exchange Agent (for
distribution to each Company Stockholder in accordance with such Company
Stockholder's Common Pro Rata

   

Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) such
excess amount, multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata Percentage, and
(y) to the Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company Optionholder in
accordance with such Company Optionholder's Option Pro Rata Percentage) a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) such excess amount,
multiplied by (B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage.

 

Article XII. 
Indemnification

 

12.1Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants

 

. Each representation warranty, covenant and other obligation or agreement
contained herein and any certificate related to any such representation,
warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement will survive the Closing
and continue in full force and effect for 15 months from the Closing Date,
except that (x) the Fundamental Representations and representations and
warranties in Section 4.15 (Tax Matters) and in Section 4.25 (Government
Contracts) shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for
36 months from the Closing Date; and (y) each of the covenants and agreements
of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith that, by its
terms, provides for performance following the Closing Date shall survive the
Closing indefinitely or for the shorter period explicitly specified therein,
except that for such covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter
period, breaches thereof shall survive until the latest date permitted by
applicable law (each such date, a "Survival Expiration Date"); provided,
further, that each representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall
survive the applicable Survival Expiration Date for purposes of any
Indemnification Claim properly given in respect thereof prior to such date.
No Indemnification Claim with respect to a breach of a representation or
warranty may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless (i) on or before
the applicable Survival Expiration Date, such claim is asserted by proper
written notice in accordance with this Article XII, specifying in reasonable
detail the basis of the claim, and (ii) such claim is made in respect of
Losses specified in reasonable detail and incurred prior to the applicable
Survival Expiration Date or, to the extent arising out of an Indemnification
Claim asserted in writing prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date,
such Indemnification Claim is made in respect of Losses expected to arise in
connection with such claim.

 

12.2Indemnification.

 

(a)Subject to Section 12.4, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
Affiliates, including following the Effective Time the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties"), shall be
entitled to indemnification for any and all Losses to the extent arising from
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto (disregarding any
limitation as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representation or warranty solely for purposes of determining the Losses
arising from such breach), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement requiring performance by the Company prior to or
at the Closing, or any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in the
Escrow Agreement by the Holder Representative, in its capacity as such, (iii)
any Taxes of or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
portion of any Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing Date (in the case
of income Taxes) and ending on or before the day

   

immediately preceding the Closing Date (in the case of all other Taxes),
except to the extent such Taxes are Transfer Taxes (which shall be allocated
in accordance with Section 8.2(a)) or were included as current liabilities in
calculating Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in
accordance with Section 3.5(b)); provided, that with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of
such Straddle Period shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.2(d),
(iv) any Funded Debt or Outstanding Company Expenses in each case not taken
into account in the calculation of the Aggregate Consideration as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.5, and (v) any Excess Dissenting Share
Payments.

 

(b)Subject to Section 12.4, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Company Equityholders harmless for any and all
Losses to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto (disregarding any limitation as to
materiality set forth in such representation or warranty solely for purposes
of determining the Losses arising from such breach) or (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by
Parent or Merger Sub prior to or at the Closing or by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing, or any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in the Escrow Agreement by Parent.

 

(c)The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XII shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree.
The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for
appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when
all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party
shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered
by it.

 

12.3Third Party Indemnification Claim Procedures.

 

(a)Upon receipt of any written notice of an Action commenced or threatened by
a third party that may give rise to an Indemnification Claim (other than a Tax
Claim) by a Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnitor a written notice (w) describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Action, (x) including copies of any papers served with respect to such
Action, (y) including the Indemnified Party's best estimate of the amount of
Losses that may arise from such Action (to the extent reasonably practicable)
and (z) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's
request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the
Indemnitor in accordance with this Section 12.3(a) will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except
to the extent (A) the defense of such Action is actually prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice or (B) the Indemnified Party
fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in accordance
with this Section 12.3(a) prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date.

   

(b)An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim relating to a
third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") with counsel of the Indemnitor's
choice and at the Indemnitor's expense; provided that prior to assuming
control of such defense, the Indemnitor must (i) acknowledge in writing that
it would have an indemnity obligation for the Losses resulting from such Third
Party Claim pursuant to and subject to the terms of this Article XII
(assuming, but not acknowledging or stipulating to, the accuracy of the basis
of the claim set forth in the applicable notice delivered to the Indemnitor)
and (ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence that the Indemnitor has
adequate resources to defend such Indemnification Claim and fulfill its
indemnity obligations hereunder (if applicable, taking into account the amount
then in the Indemnification Escrow Account). The Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnitor does not
deliver the acknowledgment referred to in the preceding sentence within 30
days of receipt of notice of such Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section
12.3(a), (ii) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation,
(iii) such Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) the Indemnitee provides
notice to the Indemnitor that it reasonably believes that the Indemnitor has
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend vigorously such Third Party Claim
and after 30 days of receipt of such notice the Indemnitor continues to fail
to prosecute or defend vigorously such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (x) if the Indemnified Party controls the
defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Section
12.3(b), the Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (y) if the Indemnitor shall assume and
control the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of
this Section 12.3(b), the Indemnitor will not agree to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such
settlement provide for a complete release of the claims, liabilities and
obligations that are the subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified
Party and its Affiliates and does not impose injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. If an
Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party will have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel of its choice for
such purpose, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnitor; provided, that in connection with such participation, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain one counsel, selected by the
Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor to the
extent an actual conflict of interest exists or would reasonably be expected
to arise between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor in respect of any
such defense or settlement.

 

(c)Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the conduct of the defense or
prosecution of a Third Party Claim and at the reasonable request of the other
party shall grant the other party and its representatives reasonable access,
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, to such party's books,
records, employees and properties to the extent reasonably related to the
matters to which the applicable Third Party Claim relates. All such
reasonable

   

access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted
under conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of such party.

 

(d)With respect to any Indemnification Claim made by any Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 12.2(a), the Holder Representative shall, on
behalf of the Company Equityholders, exercise all rights of the Indemnitor as
set forth in this Article XII; provided, that the Holder Representative shall
not have any liability as an Indemnitor to any Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article XII.

 

12.4[RESERVED]. 

 

12.5Limitations on Indemnification Liability.

 

(a)Except in the case of fraud, the aggregate amount of Losses for which the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XII will not exceed the amount of funds available in the
Indemnification Escrow Account and the amount of such funds then remaining in
the Indemnification Escrow Account shall serve as the sole and exclusive
source of payment of any such Indemnification Claim. The aggregate amount of
Losses for which the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XII will not exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Amount.

 

(b)(i) Except with respect to indemnification for Losses that relate to any
breach of a Company Fundamental Representation or of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 4.13(b) (Accounts Receivable) or
Section 4.15 (Tax Matters), or in the case of fraud, the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
12.2(a)(i), and the Company Equityholders shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(i), as applicable, with respect to
any claim for indemnification unless the amount of Losses (including costs and
expenses of the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as
applicable, incurred in connection with making such claim under this
Agreement) incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company
Equityholders, as applicable, that are the subject of such claim (together
with all claims arising out of or based upon the same or related
circumstances) exceeds $50,000 (the "Per-Claim Basket"), and, subject to the
other applicable limitations on liability set forth in this Article XII, the
Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as applicable, shall
only be entitled to indemnification for such Losses if such Losses exceed the
Per-Claim Basket; and (ii) except with respect to indemnification for Losses
that relate to any breach of a Company Fundamental Representation or of any of
the representations and warranties in Section 4.10(d) (Intellectual Property),
Section 4.13(b) (Accounts Receivable), Section 4.15 (Tax Matters) or Section
4.25 (Government Contracts), or in the case of fraud, the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
12.2(a)(i) and the Company Equityholders shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(i) to the extent the aggregate
amount of all Losses (including costs and expenses of the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Company Equityholders, as applicable, incurred in connection
with making such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as applicable, for which the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
12.2(a)(i) or the Company Equityholders are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(i), as applicable (excluding in each case any
Losses in respect of any claims for

   

which the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as
applicable, are not entitled to indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 12.5(b)), exceeds Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the
"Deductible"), and, subject to the other applicable limitations on liability
set forth in this Article XII, the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company
Equityholders, as applicable, shall only be entitled to indemnification for
such Losses to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible.

 

(c)All Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XII shall be reduced by the amount of (i)
all actual reductions in cash Taxes of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates arising as the result of the Loss in the taxable year in which the
Loss was paid or incurred and (ii) all insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments and other third-party recoveries (including any collected accounts
receivable that provided the basis for a claim pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i)
by a Parent Indemnified Party with respect to the last sentence of Section
4.13(b)) actually received by any Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses
incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party
determines in good faith it is entitled to any reduction in cash Taxes,
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in
respect of any Losses (or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto) for
which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article XII, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, receive or realize such reductions, proceeds, payments or
recoveries; provided that under no circumstances shall any Indemnified Party
be required to initiate any Action against any other Person in connection
therewith. In the event that any such reduction in cash Taxes, insurance
proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are actually
obtained, received by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such
Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the
claims to which such reduction in cash Taxes, insurance proceeds, indemnity
payments or other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be
made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant
portion of such indemnification payment.

 

(d)No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Losses in respect of any liability included in the calculation of the
Aggregate Consideration.

 

(e)In the event an Indemnified Party actually recovers Losses in respect of an
Indemnification Claim, no other Indemnified Party may recover the same Losses
in respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

 

12.6Mitigation of Losses

 

. An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XII upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that
has given rise to such Losses.

 

12.7Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy

 

. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing, except (i) in the case of fraud, (ii) as set forth in Section 13.5
and Section 13.14, and (iii) the rights of the Company Equityholders to
receive all payments to be made to them pursuant to Article III, claims under
this Article XII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy pursuant to and with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties and each of

   

the Parent Indemnified Parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying party and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or
successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or
otherwise; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Section 12.7 shall not relieve any of such Persons for any
liability for fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Amount shall
not be considered "remedies" for purposes of this Section 12.7 and shall not
be limited by the terms of this Section 12.7.

 

Article XIII.

13.10 and by an agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not
necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement.

 

13.2Notices

13.7Captions; Counterparts

 

. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

 

13.8Schedules and Exhibits

 

. The Schedules (including the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent
Disclosure Schedules) and Exhibits referenced herein are a part of this
Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references herein to Schedules
and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement,
unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure made by a party in
the Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to any other sections or
schedules to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure is relevant to such other section or schedule contained in this
Agreement. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely
for informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed
in connection with the

   

representations and warranties made in this Agreement, nor shall such
information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality.

 

13.9Entire Agreement

 

. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement), the Escrow Agreement and that certain Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of January 7, 2015, by and between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any
other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered
into, prior to or contemporaneous with the effectiveness of this Agreement, by
or among any of the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties,
covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist between the Parties except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant hereto.

 

13.10Amendments

 

. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by a
duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same manner as this
Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement; provided, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Section
13.1, Section 13.3(a), Section 13.4, Section 13.6(b), this Section 13.10,
Section 13.13 and Section 13.15 may not be amended or modified in whole or in
part in a manner that adversely impacts a Financing Source without the written
consent of such Financing Source.

 

13.11Publicity

 

. All press releases or other public communications of any nature whatsoever
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of
the release for publication thereof, shall prior to the Closing be subject to
the prior mutual approval of Parent, the Company and the Holder
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed by any Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by the listing rules
of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in which event such Party
shall use reasonable efforts to consult the other prior to making such
disclosure and will consider in good faith any comments provided by the other
Party; provided that after the transactions contemplated hereby have been
publicly announced, Parent shall be entitled to respond to questions in the
ordinary course and to make other public disclosure that, in each case, is
consistent with any public statement previously issued or made by it in
accordance with this Section 13.11.

 

13.12Severability

 

. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. The Parties further agree that if any
provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in
any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any
actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid
and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent
necessary, shall negotiate in good faith to amend or otherwise modify this
Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or
unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
original intent of the Parties.

   

13.13Jurisdiction

 

. Subject to Section 13.6(b), any Action (except for any Action contemplated
by Section 13.6(b)) based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the
federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court
of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of
the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such
court in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined only in any such
court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any Party to serve
process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each
case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action, suit or proceeding brought
pursuant to this Section 13.13.

 

13.14Enforcement

 

. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, (b) the availability of monetary damages shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right to
specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4, it
is hereby acknowledged and agreed that (i) the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the obligations
of the Financing Sources to fund the Financing under the Debt Documents and
(ii) in the event that any of the Financing Sources initiate litigation
against Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Financing, or advise Parent
or Merger Sub that they intend not to proceed with the Financing in violation
of the terms of the Debt Documents, the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to require Parent and Merger Sub to take enforcement action,
including seeking specific performance, to cause such Financing Sources to
provide such Financing. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 13.14 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction.

   

13.15Non-Recourse

 

. Without limiting the rights of the Parties under Section 13.14, this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities that are
expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party; provided, however
that nothing herein shall limit the rights and remedies of the Company and its
Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreement. Except in the case of fraud,
(i) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, manager, partner, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any named Party and (ii) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Parties (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Company, on behalf of
itself and its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, controlling persons, agents and other representatives
(collectively with the Company, the "Company Related Parties") agrees that
none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to any
Company Related Party relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein or hereby (including the Financing and the transactions
contemplated thereby) and (y) each of the Company Related Parties hereby
waives any right or claim of any kind or description and agrees that it will
not bring or support any Action of any kind or description (whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Sources which directly or indirectly arise out of or in any way
relate to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings or any other transactions contemplated thereby. This Section 13.15
is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources.

 

13.16Acknowledgement and Waiver

 



 

.

 

(a)It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Holder Representative
has retained Latham and Watkins, LLP ("LandW") and the Company has retained LandW to
act as their respective counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that LandW has not acted as counsel for any other Person
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of
interest or any other purposes. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that
any attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
attaching as a result of LandW's representation of the Company or the Holder
Representative related to the preparation for, and negotiation and
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all communications among LandW and the Company, the Company Equityholders, the
Holder Representatives and/or their respective Affiliates related to the
preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and
materials relating thereto) between the Company and its Subsidiaries and LandW
related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and
transferred to the Holder

   

Representative, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release all of
their respective rights and interests to and in such communications and
related materials and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release
any right to assert or waive any privilege related to the communications
referenced in this Section 13.16, the Company and its Subsidiaries acknowledge
and agree that all such rights shall reside with the Holder Representative.

 

(b)Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current
or prior representation of the Company by LandW, LandW shall be allowed to
represent any Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company that either is existing on the date hereof or arises in the
future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby waive any conflicts or claim of
privilege that may arise in connection with such representation. Further,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that, in the event that a dispute
arises after Closing between Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and any Company
Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates,
LandW may represent such Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Company
Equityholder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate may be directly adverse
to Parent or the Company and even though LandW may have represented the Company
in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 

(c)Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that any advice given to or communication
with any Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company) shall not be subject to any
joint privilege and shall be owned solely by such Company Equityholder, the
Holder Representative and any Affiliate of each such party. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company each hereby acknowledge that each of them have had the
opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the
significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to,
the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the
opportunity to consult with counsel other than LandW.
