AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July 23, 2015, by and among (i) First Financial Bank, National
Association, a national bank organized under the Laws of the United States
("Purchaser"), (ii) OSF II Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"),
(iii) AG-OSF Holdings LLC, a limited liability company organized under the
Laws of the State of Delaware ("Stockholders' Representative") and (iv) Oak
Street Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Purchaser, Merger Sub
and the Company, have each duly approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement, and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger") in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants
hereinafter set forth, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt,
sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
MERGER; CLOSING

Section 1.1 The Merger.

(a) The Merger. At the Effective Time and in accordance with, and subject to,
the provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company and shall cease to exist, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the Company immediately following the
Effective Time, the "Surviving Company"), and become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Purchaser.

(b) Effectiveness of the Merger. Immediately following the Closing, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed,
signed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon such filing. The time when the Merger shall become effective is
referred to herein as the "Effective Time".

(c) Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL. The name of the Surviving Company shall remain "Oak
Street Holdings Corporation" at the Effective Time.

(d) Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws; Officers and Directors of Surviving
Company. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of
the Surviving Company until amended as provided in the Surviving Company
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as applicable, or by the DGCL. Prior
to the Closing,

* * *





the Company shall take all requisite action so that the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after
the Effective Time, the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Company until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
subject to their earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company and the DGCL.

Section 1.2 Effect on Capital Stock; Payments at Closing

(a) Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
automatically and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Stockholders:

(i) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the Common Stock
of the Surviving Company;

(ii) each Common Share held of record immediately prior to the Closing shall
be converted into the right to receive (A) at Closing (x) the Common Share
Closing Amount minus (y) the Per Share Holdback Percentage of the Holdback
Amount and (B) following the Closing, payment of the Per Share Holdback
Percentage with respect to any Additional Amount that is paid;

(iii) each Preferred Share held of record immediately prior to the Closing
shall be converted into the right to receive (A) at Closing (x) the Preferred
Share Closing Amount minus (y) the Per Share Holdback Percentage of the
Holdback Amount and (B) following the Closing, payment of the Per Share
Holdback Percentage with respect to any Additional Amount that is paid; and

(iv) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and owned by the Company (whether as treasury stock or otherwise) shall be
canceled and cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
owned by each Stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who has
demanded appraisal in accordance with, and has not effectively withdrawn or
lost the right to appraisal pursuant to, Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a
"Dissenting Stockholder" and the Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholders,
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive payments
of the applicable amounts set forth in Section 1.2(a), but instead and in lieu
thereof shall have the right to receive payment from the Surviving Company
with respect to its Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. If any such Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall be
treated as having been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive payments of the applicable amounts set 

forth in Section 1.2(a). At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent only those rights
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, upon surrender by each Stockholder of
the certificate(s) which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Shares (each, a "Share Certificate"), together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, such Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive, and Purchaser shall pay, the applicable amounts set
forth in Section 1.2(a) for each Share represented by such Share Certificate,
such amount to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one
or more accounts designated by the Stockholders' Representative. Each Share
Certificate so surrendered shall be immediately cancelled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any amount payable hereunder upon due surrender of Share
Certificates.

(d) At the Effective Time, all Shares converted into the right to receive the
applicable amounts set forth in Section 1.2(a), shall automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist and the holders thereof shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares (or the Share Certificates) other than the
right to receive the applicable amounts set forth in Section 1.2(a). Until
surrendered as contemplated by Section 1.2(c), each Share Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the applicable amounts set forth in Section 1.2(a). The payment of the
applicable amounts set forth in Section 1.2(a) upon the surrender of any Share
Certificate shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to that Share Certificate and all Shares formerly
represented by such Share Certificate.

(e) Payments at Closing.

(i) Notice of Estimates. Not less than one Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, Stockholders' Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a written notice
setting forth the Transaction Expenses calculated in good faith.

(ii) Payment of Transaction Expenses. At the Closing, Purchaser will pay or
cause to be paid to each Person to whom the Company or its Subsidiaries owes
Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts and in the amounts designated by Stockholders' Representative,
provided Purchaser has received customary letters confirming payment in full
to each such Person and confirming closure of the respective file or account
associated therewith.

(iii) Escrow Amount. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent on or prior to
the Closing Date.

(iv) Expense Reserve Amount. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid an amount equal to the Expense Reserve Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Stockholders'
Representative on or prior to the Closing Date. 

(v) Payment of the Warehouse Debt. Stockholders' Representative shall cause to
be delivered to Purchaser customary payoff letters (the "Payoff Letters") from
the Persons to whom the Warehouse Debt is payable, signed by such Persons,
setting forth, among other things, (A) the amount required to pay off in full
at the Closing all the Warehouse Debt held by such Person, (B) wire transfer
instructions for the payment of such amount, and (C) the commitment to release
all Encumbrances, if any, which such Person may hold on any member of the
Company Group or any of the assets of such parties upon receipt of the payoff
amount set forth therein. At the Closing, Purchaser will pay to the Persons to
whom the Warehouse Debt is payable the amounts set forth in the applicable
Payoff Letter by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
applicable accounts specified therein.

Section 1.3 Closing

The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of
Frost Brown Todd LLC, 3300 Great American Tower, 301 East Fourth Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, at 10:00 A.M., Cincinnati time on the date (the

the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI have been satisfied or waived (other

Stockholders' Representative.

subject to any valid claim of Liability to, any broker, finder, consultant or
other intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 3.7 Investment Intent

Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own account for investment purposes
only and not with a view to any public distribution thereof or with any
intention of selling, distributing or otherwise disposing of the Shares in a
manner that would violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act
or any similar provisions of any applicable Law. Purchaser agrees that the
Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated
or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any
other applicable securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration under the Securities Act and such Laws. Purchaser is able to bear
the economic risk of holding the Shares for an indefinite period (including
total loss of its investment), and (either alone or together with its
Representatives) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment. Purchaser qualifies as an "accredited investor," as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

Section 3.8 Purchaser's Business Investigation; Disclaimer Regarding
Projections

(a) Purchaser has conducted such investigation of the Company Group as it has
deemed necessary in order to make an informed decision concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser has reviewed all of the documents,
records, reports and other materials identified in the Disclosure Schedules
hereto, or included in the electronic data room maintained in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and is familiar with the content thereof.
Purchaser acknowledges that it has been given access to and has visited and
examined the properties and assets of the Company Group and is familiar with
the condition thereof. For the purpose of conducting these investigations,
Purchaser has employed the services of its own Representatives. In all matters
affecting the condition of the properties and assets and the contents of the
documents, records, reports or other materials in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser is relying upon the advice and
opinion offered by its own Representatives. None of the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives shall have, or be subject to, any Liability to
Purchaser or any other Person resulting from Purchaser's use of any such
information, including any information, documents or material made available
to Purchaser and its representatives in any "data rooms" (virtual or
otherwise), management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Except as and to the limited extent expressly set forth in ARTICLE II,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other
Person is making or has made, and that none of them shall have Liability in
respect of, any written or oral representation or warranty, express or
implied, of any nature whatsoever, with respect to any member of the Company
Group, including as to (i) merchantability or fitness for any particular use
or purpose, (ii) 

the operation of the Company's business by Purchaser after the Closing in any
manner, or (iii) the probable success or profitability of the Company's
business after the Closing, and Purchaser (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) specifically disclaims that it is relying on or has relied on any
such representation or warranty as an inducement to enter into this Agreement
or otherwise.

(c) In connection with Purchaser's investigation of the Company Group and its
business, Purchaser has received from the Company and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives certain projections and other forecasts,
including projected financial statements, cash flow items, certain business
plan information and other data related to the Company Group and/or the
Business. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such projections, forecasts and plans and, accordingly, is
not relying on them, (ii) Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties and is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all projections, forecasts and plans so furnished to it and (iii)
Purchaser shall have no claim against anyone with respect to any of the
foregoing. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates or Representatives nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty with respect to such projections and other
forecasts and plans.

requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Laws (which actions shall
include furnishing all information required by applicable Law in connection
with approvals of or filings with any Governmental Authority), including the
following:

(i) filing, or causing to be filed, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, any required notification and report forms under the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice; 

(ii) providing for review and approval, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, all necessary applications and filings in connection with the
Required Actions, each of which shall contain complete information and all
materials required by the applicable Governmental Authority; providing all

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including agreeing to any

its Affiliates or of the Company Group (including, with respect to clauses (A)
and (B), executing and consummating agreements, and submitting to judicial or
administrative orders, to hold separate and divest any such assets), or at the
request of Stockholders' Representative, litigating any such matter;

provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.2(b) shall require any
member of the Company Group to make any monetary expenditure, commence or
participate in any Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to any third Person.

(c) Each of the Company and Purchaser shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act, the Required Actions, or any other Laws. The Company and
Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice and other Governmental Authorities (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law), and shall comply as promptly as practicable with
any such inquiry or request. Each of the Company and Purchaser agrees to
instruct its respective counsel to cooperate with each other and use their
respective best efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and
resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act, the Required Actions and
any other applicable Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Said best efforts
and cooperation shall include counsel's undertaking (to the extent permitted
by applicable 

Law and in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and without waiving attorney-client, work-product or any other applicable
privilege) to (i) furnish to each other's counsel such reasonably necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act, the Required Actions and any other applicable Laws, and (ii)
cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written or oral communications explaining or defending
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, articulating
any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Authority or other Person. None of the Company or
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
independently contact any Governmental Authority or participate in any meeting
or discussion (or any other communication by any means) with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, applications, investigations or
other inquiries without giving, in the case of Purchaser and its Affiliates,
Stockholders' Representative, and in the case of the Company and their
Affiliates, Purchaser, where practicable, prior reasonable notice of the
meeting or discussion, the opportunity to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and responses to personnel of said Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to review and comment on the contents of any
communications (oral or otherwise) expected to be made at the meeting or
discussion, and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Government Authority,
the opportunity to attend and participate at the meeting or discussion;
provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to comply with the
foregoing where such compliance would be contrary to applicable Law. Purchaser
shall pay for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including any Stockholder and any other member of the Company
Group) to comply with this Section 4.2(c), including any filing fees under the
HSR Act or with respect to the Required Actions.

(d) During the period from the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII in
accordance with its terms, except with the prior written consent of
Stockholders' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not do
anything, including entering into any transaction (or making any antitrust or
competition Law filing in connection with such transaction), that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay any filings or approvals required
under the HSR Act, the Required Actions or other applicable Laws.

Section 4.3 Access to Information; Other Contacts

From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall,
and shall cause the other members of the Company Group to, afford to Purchaser
and its Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice,
during normal business hours to all the properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, Tax Returns and records of the Company Group, and, during such
period, shall furnish as promptly as practicable to Purchaser any information
concerning the Company Group as Purchaser may reasonably request; provided,
however, that (i) such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Company Group and (ii) neither the Company nor any other
member of the Company Group is under any obligation to disclose to Purchaser
or its Representatives any information the disclosure of which is restricted
by Contract or applicable Law or would result 

in the waiver of any attorney-client, work-product or other applicable
privilege; provided, further, that Stockholders' Representative may designate
certain portions of such information as being provided on an outside-counsel
basis only. All information provided pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall remain
subject in all respects to the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.4 Confidentiality

Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold,
in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of
the other party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated March 19, 2015
between Purchaser and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing Date, at which time
such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties under this
Section 4.4 shall terminate; provided, however, that after the Closing Date,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion
of the Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.5 Publicity

The parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall, and no
party shall permit its Affiliates or its or their Representatives to, issue
any press release or otherwise make any public announcement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of Purchaser or Stockholders' Representative, as the case may be
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case
the party required to make the press release or public announcement shall
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

Section 4.6 No Solicitation

If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, Purchaser will not, for a
period of two years thereafter, without the prior written consent of
Stockholders' Representative, solicit (other than a solicitation by general
advertisement) any Person who is an officer, manager or key employee of any
member of the Company Group, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter that
precedes such termination, to terminate his or her employment with any member
of the Company Group. Purchaser agrees that any remedy at law for any breach
by Purchaser of this Section 4.6 would be inadequate, and that the Company
would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that
this restriction on Purchaser is too onerous and is not necessary for the
protection of the Company Group, Purchaser agrees that any court of competent
jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions that such court may consider
to be necessary or appropriate properly to protect the Company Group.

Section 4.7 RESERVED

Section 4.8 RESERVED 

Section 4.9 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of the
members of the Company Group to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Closing Date, an
officer or director (or a Person serving in a similar capacity) of any member
of the Company Group (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against any and all
Losses arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual Proceeding based
in whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to
the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director (or a Person
serving in a similar capacity) of any member of the Company Group whether
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after, the Closing Date (the
"DandO Indemnified Liabilities"), in each case to the full extent a corporation
is permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own officers or directors
(and Purchaser shall, or shall cause each of the members of the Company Group
to, pay expenses in advance (in accordance with applicable Law and an
appropriate undertaking to reimburse such advancement if such expenses are
determine not to be indemnifiable) of the final disposition of any such
Proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party). Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event any such Proceeding is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party
(whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified
Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company Group to, pay all
fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received and (ii) Purchaser and the Company Group will
use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
matter; provided, that neither Purchaser nor any member of the Company Group
shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
4.9 shall notify Purchaser upon learning of any such Proceeding (but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve a Person from any Liability which it
may have under this Section 4.9 except to the extent such Person is materially
prejudiced by such failure). The parties hereto agree that all rights to
indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in defense of any Proceeding, existing in favor of the DandO
Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the Closing Date
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years from the Closing Date; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such DandO
Indemnified Liabilities.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a directors'
and officers' "tail" policy, provided the premium for such policy does not
exceed 300% of the current premium paid by the Company for the same coverage,
and neither the Company nor the Purchaser shall terminate such policy without
the prior written consent of Stockholders' Representative.

(c) Purchaser and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any member of
the Company Group to, take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or
adversely affect the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
any similar organizational documents or other written agreements of any member
of the Company Group that provide indemnification of and expense reimbursement
to DandO Indemnified Parties. 

(d) If Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations of Purchaser or the Company, as
applicable, set forth in this Section 4.9.

(e) The provisions of this Section 4.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, the DandO Indemnified Parties, and each such
Person's heirs, legatees, Representatives, successors and assigns, and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Purchaser and the Company and may
not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to such DandO Indemnified
Parties without their prior written consent and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such DandO Indemnified Party may have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 4.10 Employee Benefits

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain
and perform all obligations in connection with the Benefit Plans and other
agreements set forth in Schedule 4.10(a) that have accrued or otherwise become
vested, earned or due as a result of or prior to the Closing.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement shall not, by themselves, constitute a termination of employment of
any employee of the Companies. Purchaser shall not be responsible for any
severance or termination Liabilities related to the termination of employment
of any such employee on or after the Closing Date; provided, however, such
terminated employees shall be eligible for benefits under Purchaser's
termination and severance plan more particularly described on Schedule
4.10(b).

(c) On or before the Effective Time, if requested by Purchaser with respect to
a Benefit Plan, the Company shall terminate such Benefit Plan, including any
401(k) Plan, subject to compliance with applicable Law and the terms of the
Benefit Plan. Purchaser agrees that in connection with its continuing
employment of any employee of the Company, it shall take all reasonable action
so that such employees shall be entitled to participate in Purchaser\'s 401(k)
plan as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time.

Section 4.11 Notice of Prospective Breach

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall
promptly notify Stockholders' Representative in writing of (i) any
representation or warranty made by the Purchaser or Company in this Agreement
being untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any failure of the Purchaser or Company or
any other member of the Company Group to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case that could reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 of this
Agreement not to be satisfied. 

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Stockholders'
Representative shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of (i) any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser or the Company in this Agreement
being untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any failure of Purchaser or the Company to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case that could
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations set forth
in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of this Agreement not to be satisfied.

Section 4.12 No Solicitation

The Company agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.12,
from and after the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VIII, neither it nor
any member of the Company Group nor any of their officers and directors shall,
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to instruct and cause
its and the Company Group's Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
(i) take any action to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate (including by
way of furnishing nonpublic information or assistance) any inquiries with
respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish,
or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Purchaser) any
information or data with respect to the Company or the Company Group or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger), or (iv) enter into
any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Group and each of their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.12 shall preclude
the Company or the Company Group or each of their Representatives from
contacting any such party or parties solely for the purpose of complying with
the provisions of the first clause of this sentence or to enforce the
provisions of any confidentiality agreement entered into with any person with
respect to a potential Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement,
"Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer for, whether in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, a (i) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or a member of the Company Group, (ii) sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or any similar transaction, of any assets of the Company
or a member of the Company Group representing 10% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company, (iii) recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company
or a member of the Company Group, or (iv) transaction which is similar in
form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; provided,
however, that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.13 Supplemental Information

At any time, and from time to time, prior to the Closing, the Company may (but
shall not be obligated to) supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to any fact, matter or 

circumstance arising or occurring after the date hereof, which the Company
learns of and disclosure of which is required to make any representation or
warranty set forth in ARTICLE II accurate as of the date such supplement or
amendment is made. The parties hereto agree that the furnishing of such
corrected and supplemental information pursuant to this Section 4.13 shall be
deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedules for all purposes hereunder, but not
for the purposes of ARTICLE VI unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser at the
time of such update or supplement.

ARTICLE V

(a) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file or cause to be timely prepared and
filed with the appropriate Tax Authorities all Tax Returns required to be

All Tax Returns prepared by Purchaser with respect to the Pre-2015 Tax Period
or the Straddle Period shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past

applicable Law), and Purchaser shall provide Stockholders' Representative, at
least 45 calendar days prior to the applicable deadline for filing any such
Tax Return, a copy of the Tax Return for Stockholders' Representative's review

Stockholders' Representative to such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall pay or cause
the applicable member of the Company Group to pay any Taxes due with respect
to any Tax Return required to be prepared or filed by it under this Section
5.1(a) hereof; provided, that, (i) Purchaser shall notify Stockholders'
Representative in writing of the amount of any Taxes due in connection with
the filing of such Tax Return that are the responsibility of the Stockholders
under this Agreement at least five Business Days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return and (ii) at least three Business Days prior to the due date of such

of the Company Group) the amount specified in such notice.

(b) Any Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser or any member of the
Company Group, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Purchaser or any
member of the Company Group become entitled, that relate to Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before December 31, 2014, shall be for the
account of the Stockholders, and Purchaser shall pay over to the Stockholders
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within 10 days after receipt
thereof or entitlement thereto.

Section 5.2 Transaction Taxes

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, excise, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer taxes)
imposed by or payable to any jurisdiction or any Governmental Authority
arising from the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, "Transaction
Taxes") shall be borne 100% by the Purchaser; provided, however, that any such
Transaction Taxes imposed on or payable by a Stockholder shall be borne 100%
by the respective Stockholder. All necessary Tax Returns with respect to all
such Transaction Taxes shall be filed by the Person responsible for such
Transaction Taxes. 

Section 5.3 Cooperation; Records Retention

(a) The Stockholders' Representative, Company and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including by provision of any required power-of-
attorney (or other form of authorization) and maintaining and making available
to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

(b) Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, and work papers and all
material records and other documents relating thereto of the Company Group
until the expiration of the later of (i) the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date or (ii) the date on which Taxes may no longer be assessed under
the applicable statutes of limitation, including any waivers or extensions
thereof. Thereafter, Purchaser shall not destroy or dispose of any such Tax
Returns, schedules, work papers or any other material records or other
documents relating thereto without giving written notice to Stockholders'
Representative of such pending destruction or disposal and offering
Stockholders' Representative the right to copy such documents and information.
Purchaser shall be entitled to destroy or dispose of any such Tax Returns,
schedules, work papers and all material records and other documents relating
thereto described in such notice if Stockholders' Representative fails to
request copies thereof within 90 days after receipt of the notice described in
this Section 5.3.

Section 5.4 Straddle Period

For purposes of this ARTICLE V, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount
of any (i) Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company
Group for the Pre-2015 Tax Period and (ii) all other Taxes that otherwise can
be reasonably allocated to the Pre-2015 Tax Period shall be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on December 31,
2014. The amount of any Taxes of the Company Group for a Straddle Period to be
attributed to the Pre-2015 Tax Period that is not susceptible to allocation
based on the methodology described in the preceding sentence shall be
determined by multiplying the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on December 31, 2014, and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period.

Section 5.5 Conduct After Closing

Without the prior consent of Stockholders' Representative (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, denied or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit its Affiliates to, take any action on or after the Closing
Date that could reasonably be expected to affect the Tax Liability of the
Stockholders or any of their Affiliates (including the members of the Company
Group) for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior
to December 31, 2014. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit its Affiliates to, carry any losses or other Tax attributes
arising after December 31, 2014 to any taxable year or period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to December 31, 2014. Purchaser shall not file or
cause or permit any member of the Company Group to file any amended return or
other Tax Return, or take any 

action relating to a Tax Return (including the provision of an extension of
the period of limitations for assessment of any Tax), with respect to any
period ending on or prior to December 31, 2014, make any Tax election or
effect any change in Tax accounting method affecting any such period or carry
back any loss carryovers or other Tax attribute from a period ending after
December 31, 2014 to a period ending on or before December 31, 2014. Neither
Purchaser, any member of the Company Group, nor any of their Affiliates shall
make any election under Section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any
similar state or local provision) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall not take any action with
respect to the Company Group subsequent to the Closing that would cause the
transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is
the same as, or substantially similar to the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-11.

Section 5.6 Closing of Company's Tax Year

Purchaser shall structure its effecting of the Merger to cause the Company
Group's Tax year to end as of the Closing Date for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes and shall elect to end any Tax year for which such an election is
available.

satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's breach in any material
respect of any provision of this Agreement or failure to use all the requisite
efforts required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, as
required by and subject to Section 4.2 and any other applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 7.1 Survival

The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and the right
to assert a claim for indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to Section
7.2 or Section 7.3, shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this
ARTICLE VII and shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Survival Date") and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect;
provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections Section 2.2, Section 2.3, 2.4(a)(i), 2.11(e), 2.11(m), 2.20, Section
3.2 and Section 3.6 (the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
indefinitely. The covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this
Agreement shall not survive the Closing except with respect to those covenants
and agreements that by their terms contemplate performance in whole or in part
after the Closing, which shall remain in full force and effect until the date
by which such covenant or agreement is required to be performed. The
obligations in this ARTICLE VII to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified
Party, shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, in respect of a
breach of any representation or warranty, on the Survival Date and, in respect
of a breach of any covenant, when such covenant terminates or expires pursuant
to the terms hereof; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to a Fundamental Representation
or with respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have made,
before the expiration of the applicable period, a bona fide claim by
delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim) pursuant to Section 7.6 to the Indemnifying Party.

Section 7.2 Indemnification by Purchaser

Subject to the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement
(including the provisions of Sections 7.1, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6), from and after
the Closing, Purchaser and the Company Group shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify Stockholders and their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, successors and assigns (the "Stockholder Indemnified
Parties") against, and hold the Stockholder Indemnified Parties harmless from,
all Losses actually incurred by any of the Stockholder Indemnified Parties to
the extent arising out of:

(a) any inaccuracy or breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of any representation
or warranty made by such Person in ARTICLE III of this Agreement;

(b) any failure by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including Merger Sub)
to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement; 

(c) any breach of any post-closing covenant or agreement in this Agreement by
any member of the Company Group; and

(d) any claim or cause of action by any Person arising after the Closing
against any Stockholder Indemnified Party with respect to the operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

Section 7.3 Indemnification by Stockholders

Subject to the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement
(including the provisions of Sections 7.1, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6), from and after
the Closing, Stockholders shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and its
and their respective officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns
(the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against, and hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from, all Losses actually incurred by any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out of:

(a) any inaccuracy of or breach by the Company of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in ARTICLE II of this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any post-closing covenant or agreement in this Agreement by
the Stockholders' Representative; and

(c) any Taxes attributable to a Pre-2015 Tax Period.



Section 7.4 Limitations on Indemnification

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) except for Losses resulting from a breach of a Fundamental Representation
or for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may claim under Section 7.3(c),
the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from Stockholders by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.3
shall be $7,500,000 (the "Indemnity Cap");

(ii) except for Losses resulting from a breach of a Fundamental Representation
or for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may claim under Section 7.3(c),
Stockholders shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.3 unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from
Stockholders equals or exceeds $500,000 (the "Basket Amount"), in which case
Stockholders shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount;

(iii) no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification, to
sue for damages or to assert any other right or remedy under this Agreement
(whether under this ARTICLE VII or otherwise) against any Stockholder or any
Stockholder's Affiliates with respect to any Loss, cause of action or other
claim to 

the extent (A) such Loss, cause of action or claim results from actions taken
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party outside the ordinary course of business, or
(B) the Purchaser Indemnified Party failed to give timely notice of such Loss,
cause of action or claim, to the extent any Stockholder is actually prejudiced
thereby, or (C) such Loss, cause of action or claim is primarily a possible or
potential Loss, cause of action or claim that such party believes may be
asserted rather than a Loss, cause of action or claim that has, in fact, been
filed of record against such party or one of its Affiliates or paid or
incurred by such party or one of its Affiliates, or (D) such party or any of
its Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) to accelerate
the time period in which such Loss, cause of action or claim is asserted or
payable;

(iv) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any amount relating to
any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent such
Indemnified Party (or other Purchaser Indemnified Parties in the event of a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, or other Stockholder Indemnified Parties in the
event of a Stockholder Indemnified Party) has already recovered such amount
with respect to such matter pursuant to that or other provisions of this
Agreement;

(v) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Loss to the extent
that the Loss comprising a claim (or part thereof) with respect to such matter
has been included in the calculation of the Gross Common Payment and which was
paid at the Closing; and

(vi) no party shall be liable for any consequential damages (including loss of
revenue, income or profits, loss in value of assets or securities, diminution
in value), punitive, speculative, treble, remote, special, incidental or
indirect damages, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to
the breach of this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, Stockholders' Representative, the Company,
Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Indemnity Cap and
Basket Amount shall not apply to any Losses for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may recover with respect to the Fundamental
Representations (as applicable to Company) or Section 7.3(c) of this
Agreement.

(b) Each party shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any of its Losses (including
incurring costs to the extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise
to the Losses) upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, its sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Purchaser hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (including the members of the Company Group
following the Closing) to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all
claims it may have against any Stockholder or any Stockholder's Affiliates
arising under or based upon this Agreement, 

any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any Law or
otherwise, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE VII. The rights and claims waived by Purchaser, on behalf of itself
and Purchaser Indemnified Parties (including the members of the Company Group
following the Closing), include claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for
breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty.

Section 7.5 Computation of Indemnity Payments

(a) The amount payable under this ARTICLE VII in respect of any Loss shall be
calculated net of (A) any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party as of the time of payment or realizable at any time thereafter on
account of the event giving rise to such payment, (B) any related reserves set
forth in the Financial Statements and (C) any insurance proceeds or other
amounts under indemnification agreements with third parties received by the
Indemnified Party on account thereof; provided, in each case, that the
Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Tax Benefits and insurance (and other)
recoveries and provided, further, that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
have no right to assert any claims under this ARTICLE VII with respect to any
matters that would have been covered by insurance had Purchaser maintained for
the benefit of the members of the Company Group, as applicable (or caused the
members of the Company Group, as applicable, to maintain) the same insurance
coverage following the Closing that was in effect for the members of the
Company Group immediately prior to the Closing. If any Indemnified Party
receives a Tax Benefit at any time after an indemnification payment is made to
it under this ARTICLE VII, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to
the applicable Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time
or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized by the
Indemnified Party. As used in this Section 7.5, "Tax Benefit" shall include
any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise
would have been paid due to a deduction, credit or other Tax benefit or
allowance arising by reason of the event giving rise to a claim under this
ARTICLE VII. In computing the amount of any Tax Benefit pursuant to this
Section 7.5, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize any items of
loss, deduction or credit as a result of such indemnified Loss before
recognizing any other items of loss, deduction or credit.

(b) In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made at any time after
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made with
respect to any indemnified Loss or indemnified Tax, then, to the extent of the
amount of such indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net
amount of the recovery (less the costs of recovery to the Indemnified Party)
shall be made promptly to the applicable Indemnifying Party. The party making
any indemnification payment hereunder shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by such party.

Section 7.6 Procedures for Indemnification

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE VII is
referred to herein as an "Indemnified Party". The Person from whom
indemnification is sought is referred to herein as the "Indemnifying Party".
Promptly after receiving notice of any Proceeding, investigation, demand or
other claim against the Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third Party 

Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice of such claim (any
such written notice, an "Indemnification Notice") to: (i) Purchaser, if the
Third Party Claim arises under Section 7.2 and (ii) Stockholders'
Representative, if the Third Party Claim arises under Section 7.3. Each such
Indemnification Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the applicable
Third Party Claim, including the facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount
of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, that the failure to
so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense, and at its option
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable
counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided, that
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
provided, that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Party and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnifying
Party under this ARTICLE VII). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith, and upon advice of
counsel, that an actual conflict of interest makes representation of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel
inappropriate, then the Indemnified Party may, upon notice to the Indemnifying
Party, engage separate counsel, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party to the extent the
Third Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder.

(c) Upon assumption of the defense of any such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid,
any part of the Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in
writing to such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle, or admit any Liability with
respect to, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless the relief (i) consists solely of money
damages (all of which the Indemnifying Party shall pay) and (ii) includes a
provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
Indemnified Party from all Liability with respect thereto; provided, however,
that if the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such settlement or
compromise and such settlement or compromise does not include injunctive
relief, the Liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount that would
have otherwise been payable had the Indemnifying Party entered into such
settlement or compromise.

(d) In all cases, the Indemnified Party shall provide its reasonable
cooperation with the Indemnifying Party in defense of claims or litigation
relating to Third Party Claims, including by making employees, information and
documentation reasonably available. If the Indemnifying Party shall not,
within 10 Business Days of receiving the Indemnification Notice, notify the
Indemnified Party that it shall assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim, or fails to defend or withdraws from the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against such matter in a manner
consistent with the above provisions regarding conduct of 

the defense by the Indemnified Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party may
not settle any such matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

(e) The Indemnified Party shall provide written notice of claim that is not a
Third Party Claim to: (i) Purchaser, if such claim arises under Section 7.2
and (ii) Stockholders' Representative, if such claim arises under Section 7.3.
Such claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any
claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of
the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, that the
failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the
extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(f) Subject to this ARTICLE VII, after any final decision, judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction (and a resolution of any appeal therefrom and the expiration of
the time in which to appeal therefrom), or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case, with respect to a claim
hereunder (i) if the claim for indemnification was brought pursuant to Section
7.2, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all sums due and owing to the
Stockholder Indemnified Party in immediately available funds to an account
specified by the Stockholder Indemnified Party and (ii) if the claim for
indemnification was brought pursuant to Section 7.3, Purchaser and
Stockholders' Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to promptly pay to
Purchaser (payable by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. funds in
accordance with the written payment instructions furnished by Purchaser to the
Escrow Agent), from the Escrow Funds, any sums due and owing in accordance
with this ARTICLE VII. Any balance remaining in the Escrow Fund, net of any
outstanding, unresolved claims brought pursuant to Section 7.3 shall
automatically transfer to Stockholders' Representative (for the benefit of the
Stockholders) and such funds shall be released and distributed to
Stockholders' Representative or its designee (for the benefit of the
Stockholders) after the Survival Date. Any amounts not disbursed with respect
to unresolved claims brought pursuant to Section 7.3 by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties against Stockholders the next day after the Survival Date
shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent promptly after the unresolved
indemnification claims to which they relate are finally resolved in accordance
with this ARTICLE VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall any Stockholder have any Liabilities under this
Agreement (including under this ARTICLE VII) and the sole remedy of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties against the Stockholders shall be recovery
against the Escrow Funds, if any.

Section 7.7 Characterization of Indemnification Payments

Unless otherwise required by Law, all payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE
VII shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Gross Common
Payment.

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION

Section 8.1 Termination 

This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Stockholders' Representative and
Purchaser;

(b) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Stockholders' Representative and the
Company, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement and such
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3, (ii) cannot be or has not been cured
within 30 days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform and (iii) has not been waived by Purchaser;

(c) by Stockholders' Representative, upon written notice to Purchaser, if

within 30 days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform and (iii) has not been waived by Stockholders' Representative;

applicable Governmental Authority notifies any of the parties that it intends
not to grant any applicable consent set forth on Schedule 2.4(b) and/or
Schedule 3.3(b);

(e) by Purchaser or by Stockholders' Representative, upon written notice to
the other party, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside
Date; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement is the primary cause of
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; and

(f) by Stockholders' Representative, upon written notice to Purchaser, if (i)
all conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied
(or are capable of being satisfied and would have been satisfied at the

Purchaser shall have failed to complete the Closing within two Business Days
after the date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant and subject
to the provisions of Section 1.3 hereof.

Section 9.3 Severability

It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this

public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be

Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New York State

York State or federal court), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder

further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not

rights, are advised to consult promptly with the holders of record as to the

262 of the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such
provisions, which are attached hereto in full as Annex II and Annex III

discover facts in addition to or different from those which the undersigned or
such other Releasing Party now know or believe to be true with respect to the

and each Releasing Party, to fully and finally and forever settle and release
any and all matters, disputes and differences, known or unknown, suspected and
unsuspected, which do now exist, may exist or heretofore have existed between

any action on the part of any Person, upon termination of the Merger Agreement
for any reason.

and paid to them in cash by complying with the provisions of Section 262. The
surviving corporation is required to send a notice to that effect to each
Stockholder within 10 days after the Effective Time. This Notice of Merger
constitutes such notice.

The following is a brief summary of Section 262 which sets forth the
procedures for dissenting from the Merger and demanding statutory appraisal
rights. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262,
a copy of the text of which is attached hereto as Annex III.

Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must
satisfy all of the following conditions:

(a) A written demand for appraisal of Shares must be delivered to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Surviving Company within 20 days after the date of
the mailing of this Notice of Merger.

(b) A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the Stockholder of
record, fully and correctly, as such Stockholder's name appears on the
Certificates. If Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as
by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by the
fiduciary. If Shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy in common, such demand must be executed by all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a Stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the
demand, such agent is acting as agent for the record owner.

(c) A record owner, such as a broker, who holds Shares as a nominee for
others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held for all
or less than all beneficial owners of Shares as to which the holder is the
record owner. In such case the written demand must set forth the number of
Shares covered by such demand. Where the number of Shares is not expressly
stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all Shares outstanding in the
name of such record owner. Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who
intend to exercise appraisal rights should instruct the record owner to comply
strictly with the statutory requirements with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights before the expiration of the 20-day period.

(d) Where Shares are held in "street name" a Stockholder who desires appraisal
rights with respect to such Shares must take such actions as may be necessary
to ensure that 

a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record owner of such
Shares. Shares held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial
institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a
nominee of a central security depositor. Any Stockholder desiring appraisal
rights with respect to such Shares held of record by a brokerage firm, bank or
other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for
appraisal is made by the record holder thereof. Stockholders should instruct
such firm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal must be made by
the record holder of the Shares, which might be the nominee of a central
security depositor if the Shares have been so deposited. As required by
Section 262, a demand for appraisal must reasonably inform the surviving
corporation of the identity of the record holder (which might be a nominee as
described above) and of such Stockholder's intention to seek appraisal of such
Shares.

(e) Stockholders of record who elect to exercise appraisal rights must mail or
deliver their written demands to: Oak Street Holdings Corporation, 11350 N.
Meridian St., Suite 600, Carmel, IN 46032, Attention: Richard S. Dennen, Chief
Executive Officer. The written demand for appraisal should specify the
Stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of Shares owned, and that
the Stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of his or her Shares.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either the surviving corporation or
any Stockholder who has complied with the required conditions of Section 262
and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the fair value of the Shares of the dissenting Stockholders.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed, after a hearing on such
petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which Stockholders are
entitled to appraisal rights and thereafter will appraise the Shares owned by
such Stockholders, determining the fair value of such Shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be
the fair value.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal of their Shares should bear in mind
that the fair value of their Shares determined under Section 262 could be
greater than, the same as, or less than the amount per Share net to the holder
in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, they are
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek
appraisal of their Shares and that opinions of investment banking firms as to
fairness from a financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to
fair value under Section 262. The costs of the appraisal proceeding may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting
Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
be charged pro rata against the value of all Shares entitled to appraisal. In
the absence of such a determination or assessment, each party bears its own 

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Stockholders who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined an appraisal proceeding as a
named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger. After this period,
such Stockholder may withdraw his or her demand for appraisal only with the
consent of the surviving corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed
with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time,
all Stockholders' rights to appraisal will be lost. In such event,
Stockholders who have so failed to timely file a petition for appraisal or
join an appraisal proceeding will remain entitled to receive the applicable
Aggregate Consideration, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Inasmuch as the
surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, and has no
present intention to do so, any Stockholder who desires such a petition to be
filed is advised to file such a petition on a timely basis. However, no
petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal
shall be dismissed as to any Stockholder without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not
affect the right of any Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined an appraisal proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered pursuant to
the Merger Agreement within 60 days after the Effective Time.

The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 which sets forth the
procedures for dissenting from the Merger and demanding statutory appraisal
rights. This summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached
hereto as Annex III. Any Stockholder considering demanding statutory appraisal
rights is advised to consult legal counsel. 





Annex II

Delaware General Corporation Law: Section 251

§ 251\. Merger or consolidation of domestic corporations.

(a) Any 2 or more corporations existing under the laws of this State may merge
into a single corporation, which may be any 1 of the constituent corporations
or may consolidate into a new corporation formed by the consolidation,
pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, as the case may be,
complying and approved in accordance with this section.

(b) The board of directors of each corporation which desires to merge or
consolidate shall adopt a resolution approving an agreement of merger or
consolidation and declaring its advisability. The agreement shall state:

(1) The terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation;

(2) The mode of carrying the same into effect;

(3) In the case of a merger, such amendments or changes in the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by
the merger (which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate
of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety), or, if no such
amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of
incorporation;

(4) In the case of a consolidation, that the certificate of incorporation of
the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the
agreement;

(5) The manner, if any, of converting the shares of each of the constituent
corporations into shares or other securities of the corporation surviving or
resulting from the merger or consolidation, or of cancelling some or all of
such shares, and, if any shares of any of the constituent corporations are not
to remain outstanding, to be converted solely into shares or other securities
of the surviving or resulting corporation or to be cancelled, the cash,
property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity which the
holders of such shares are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of
such shares and the surrender of any certificates evidencing them, which cash,
property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity may be in
addition to or in lieu of shares or other securities of the surviving or
resulting corporation; and

(6) Such other details or provisions as are deemed desirable, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a provision for the payment
of cash in lieu of the issuance or recognition of fractional shares, interests
or rights, or for any other arrangement with respect thereto, consistent with
§ 155 of this title. 

The agreement so adopted shall be executed and acknowledged in accordance with
§ 103 of this title. Any of the terms of the agreement of merger or
consolidation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside of such
agreement, provided that the manner in which such facts shall operate upon the
terms of the agreement is clearly and expressly set forth in the agreement of
merger or consolidation. The term "facts," as used in the preceding sentence,
includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event, including a
determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation.

(c) The agreement required by subsection (b) of this section shall be
submitted to the stockholders of each constituent corporation at an annual or
special meeting for the purpose of acting on the agreement. Due notice of the
time, place and purpose of the meeting shall be mailed to each holder of
stock, whether voting or nonvoting, of the corporation at the stockholder\'s
address as it appears on the records of the corporation, at least 20 days
prior to the date of the meeting. The notice shall contain a copy of the
agreement or a brief summary thereof. At the meeting, the agreement shall be
considered and a vote taken for its adoption or rejection. If a majority of
the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be
voted for the adoption of the agreement, that fact shall be certified on the
agreement by the secretary or assistant secretary of the corporation, provided
that such certification on the agreement shall not be required if a
certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of filing the
agreement. If the agreement shall be so adopted and certified by each
constituent corporation, it shall then be filed and shall become effective, in
accordance with § 103 of this title. In lieu of filing the agreement of merger
or consolidation required by this section, the surviving or resulting
corporation may file a certificate of merger or consolidation, executed in
accordance with § 103 of this title, which states:

(1) The name and state of incorporation of each of the constituent
corporations;

(2) That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved, adopted,
executed and acknowledged by each of the constituent corporations in
accordance with this section;

(3) The name of the surviving or resulting corporation;

(4) In the case of a merger, such amendments or changes in the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by
the merger (which amendments or changes may amend and restate the certificate
of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety), or, if no such
amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of
incorporation;

(5) In the case of a consolidation, that the certificate of incorporation of
the resulting corporation shall be as set forth in an attachment to the
certificate;

(6) That the executed agreement of consolidation or merger is on file at an
office of the surviving corporation, stating the address thereof; and 

(7) That a copy of the agreement of consolidation or merger will be furnished
by the surviving corporation, on request and without cost, to any stockholder
of any constituent corporation.

(d) Any agreement of merger or consolidation may contain a provision that at
any time prior to the time that the agreement (or a certificate in lieu
thereof) filed with the Secretary of State becomes effective in accordance
with § 103 of this title, the agreement may be terminated by the board of
directors of any constituent corporation notwithstanding approval of the
agreement by the stockholders of all or any of the constituent corporations;
in the event the agreement of merger or consolidation is terminated after the
filing of the agreement (or a certificate in lieu thereof) with the Secretary
of State but before the agreement (or a certificate in lieu thereof) has
become effective, a certificate of termination or merger or consolidation
shall be filed in accordance with § 103 of this title. Any agreement of merger
or consolidation may contain a provision that the boards of directors of the
constituent corporations may amend the agreement at any time prior to the time
that the agreement (or a certificate in lieu thereof) filed with the Secretary
of State becomes effective in accordance with § 103 of this title, provided
that an amendment made subsequent to the adoption of the agreement by the
stockholders of any constituent corporation shall not (1) alter or change the
amount or kind of shares, securities, cash, property and/or rights to be
received in exchange for or on conversion of all or any of the shares of any
class or series thereof of such constituent corporation, (2) alter or change
any term of the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation to
be effected by the merger or consolidation, or (3) alter or change any of the
terms and conditions of the agreement if such alteration or change would
adversely affect the holders of any class or series thereof of such
constituent corporation; in the event the agreement of merger or consolidation
is amended after the filing thereof with the Secretary of State but before the
agreement has become effective, a certificate of amendment of merger or
consolidation shall be filed in accordance with § 103 of this title.

(e) In the case of a merger, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving
corporation shall automatically be amended to the extent, if any, that changes
in the certificate of incorporation are set forth in the agreement of merger.

(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, unless
required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of stockholders of a
constituent corporation surviving a merger shall be necessary to authorize a
merger if (1) the agreement of merger does not amend in any respect the
certificate of incorporation of such constituent corporation, (2) each share
of stock of such constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the
effective date of the merger is to be an identical outstanding or treasury
share of the surviving corporation after the effective date of the merger, and
(3) either no shares of common stock of the surviving corporation and no
shares, securities or obligations convertible into such stock are to be issued
or delivered under the plan of merger, or the authorized unissued shares or
the treasury shares of common stock of the surviving corporation to be issued
or delivered under the plan of merger plus those initially issuable upon
conversion of any other shares, securities or obligations to be issued or
delivered under such plan do not exceed 20% of the shares of common stock of
such constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective 

date of the merger. No vote of stockholders of a constituent corporation shall
be necessary to authorize a merger or consolidation if no shares of the stock
of such corporation shall have been issued prior to the adoption by the board
of directors of the resolution approving the agreement of merger or
consolidation. If an agreement of merger is adopted by the constituent
corporation surviving the merger, by action of its board of directors and
without any vote of its stockholders pursuant to this subsection, the
secretary or assistant secretary of that corporation shall certify on the
agreement that the agreement has been adopted pursuant to this subsection and,
(1) if it has been adopted pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection,
that the conditions specified in that sentence have been satisfied, or (2) if
it has been adopted pursuant to the second sentence of this subsection, that
no shares of stock of such corporation were issued prior to the adoption by
the board of directors of the resolution approving the agreement of merger or
consolidation, provided that such certification on the agreement shall not be
required if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of
filing the agreement. The agreement so adopted and certified shall then be
filed and shall become effective, in accordance with § 103 of this title. Such
filing shall constitute a representation by the person who executes the
agreement that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately
prior to such filing.

(g) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, unless
expressly required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of
stockholders of a constituent corporation shall be necessary to authorize a
merger with or into a single direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
such constituent corporation if: (1) such constituent corporation and the
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of such constituent corporation are
the only constituent entities to the merger; (2) each share or fraction of a
share of the capital stock of the constituent corporation outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger is converted in the
merger into a share or equal fraction of share of capital stock of a holding
company having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as the share of stock of
the constituent corporation being converted in the merger; (3) the holding
company and the constituent corporation are corporations of this State and the
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary that is the other constituent
entity to the merger is a corporation or limited liability company of this
State; (4) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the holding company
immediately following the effective time of the merger contain provisions
identical to the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the constituent
corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than
provisions, if any, regarding the incorporator or incorporators, the corporate
name, the registered office and agent, the initial board of directors and the
initial subscribers for shares and such provisions contained in any amendment
to the certificate of incorporation as were necessary to effect a change,
exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation of stock,
if such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination, or
cancellation has become effective); (5) as a result of the merger the
constituent corporation or its successor becomes or remains a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company; (6) the directors of
the constituent corporation become or remain the directors of the holding
company upon the effective time of the merger; (7) the organizational
documents of the surviving entity immediately following the effective time of
the merger contain provisions identical to the certificate of incorporation of
the constituent corporation 

immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than provisions,
if any, regarding the incorporator or incorporators, the corporate or entity
name, the registered office and agent, the initial board of directors and the
initial subscribers for shares, references to members rather than stockholders
or shareholders, references to interests, units or the like rather than stock
or shares, references to managers, managing members or other members of the
governing body rather than directors and such provisions contained in any
amendment to the certificate of incorporation as were necessary to effect a
change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation
of stock, if such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination
or cancellation has become effective); provided, however, that (i) if the
organizational documents of the surviving entity do not contain the following
provisions, they shall be amended in the merger to contain provisions
requiring that (A) any act or transaction by or involving the surviving
entity, other than the election or removal of directors or managers, managing
members or other members of the governing body of the surviving entity, that
requires for its adoption under this chapter or its organizational documents
the approval of the stockholders or members of the surviving entity shall, by
specific reference to this subsection, require, in addition, the approval of
the stockholders of the holding company (or any successor by merger), by the
same vote as is required by this chapter and/or by the organizational
documents of the surviving entity; provided, however, that for purposes of
this clause (i)(A), any surviving entity that is not a corporation shall
include in such amendment a requirement that the approval of the stockholders
of the holding company be obtained for any act or transaction by or involving
the surviving entity, other than the election or removal of directors or
managers, managing members or other members of the governing body of the
surviving entity, which would require the approval of the stockholders of the
surviving entity if the surviving entity were a corporation subject to this
chapter; (B) any amendment of the organizational documents of a surviving
entity that is not a corporation, which amendment would, if adopted by a
corporation subject to this chapter, be required to be included in the
certificate of incorporation of such corporation, shall, by specific reference
to this subsection, require, in addition, the approval of the stockholders of
the holding company (or any successor by merger), by the same vote as is
required by this chapter and/or by the organizational documents of the
surviving entity; and (C) the business and affairs of a surviving entity that
is not a corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of
directors, board of managers or other governing body consisting of individuals
who are subject to the same fiduciary duties applicable to, and who are liable
for breach of such duties to the same extent as, directors of a corporation
subject to this chapter; and (ii) the organizational documents of the
surviving entity may be amended in the merger (A) to reduce the number of
classes and shares of capital stock or other equity interests or units that
the surviving entity is authorized to issue and (B) to eliminate any provision
authorized by § 141(d) of this title; and (8) the stockholders of the
constituent corporation do not recognize gain or loss for United States
federal income tax purposes as determined by the board of directors of the
constituent corporation. Neither paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section nor any
provision of a surviving entity\'s organizational documents required by
paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section shall be deemed or construed to require
approval of the stockholders of the holding company to elect or remove
directors or managers, managing members or other members of the governing body
of the surviving entity. The term "organizational documents", as used in
paragraph (g)(7) of this section and in the preceding sentence, shall, when
used in reference to a corporation, mean 

the certificate of incorporation of such corporation, and when used in
reference to a limited liability company, mean the limited liability company
agreement of such limited liability company.

As used in this subsection only, the term "holding company" means a
corporation which, from its incorporation until consummation of a merger
governed by this subsection, was at all times a direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation and whose capital stock is
issued in such merger. From and after the effective time of a merger adopted
by a constituent corporation by action of its board of directors and without
any vote of stockholders pursuant to this subsection: (i) to the extent the
restrictions of § 203 of this title applied to the constituent corporation and
its stockholders at the effective time of the merger, such restrictions shall
apply to the holding company and its stockholders immediately after the
effective time of the merger as though it were the constituent corporation,
and all shares of stock of the holding company acquired in the merger shall
for purposes of § 203 of this title be deemed to have been acquired at the
time that the shares of stock of the constituent corporation converted in the
merger were acquired, and provided further that any stockholder who
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was not an interested
stockholder within the meaning of § 203 of this title shall not solely by
reason of the merger become an interested stockholder of the holding company,
(ii) if the corporate name of the holding company immediately following the
effective time of the merger is the same as the corporate name of the
constituent corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
the shares of capital stock of the holding company into which the shares of
capital stock of the constituent corporation are converted in the merger shall
be represented by the stock certificates that previously represented shares of
capital stock of the constituent corporation and (iii) to the extent a
stockholder of the constituent corporation immediately prior to the merger had
standing to institute or maintain derivative litigation on behalf of the
constituent corporation, nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or
extinguish such standing. If an agreement of merger is adopted by a
constituent corporation by action of its board of directors and without any
vote of stockholders pursuant to this subsection, the secretary or assistant
secretary of the constituent corporation shall certify on the agreement that
the agreement has been adopted pursuant to this subsection and that the
conditions specified in the first sentence of this subsection have been
satisfied, provided that such certification on the agreement shall not be
required if a certificate of merger or consolidation is filed in lieu of
filing the agreement. The agreement so adopted and certified shall then be
filed and become effective, in accordance with § 103 of this title. Such
filing shall constitute a representation by the person who executes the
agreement that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately
prior to such filing.

(h) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, unless
expressly required by its certificate of incorporation, no vote of
stockholders of a constituent corporation whose shares are listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders
immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger by such
constituent corporation shall be necessary to authorize a merger if:

(1) The agreement of merger, which must be entered into on or after August 1,
2013, expressly provides that such merger shall be governed by this subsection
and shall be 

effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the offer
referred to in paragraph (h)(2) of this section;

(2) A corporation consummates a tender or exchange offer for any and all of
the outstanding stock of such constituent corporation on the terms provided in
such agreement of merger that, absent this subsection, would be entitled to
vote on the adoption or rejection of the agreement of merger;

(3) Following the consummation of such offer, the consummating corporation
owns at least such percentage of the stock, and of each class or series
thereof, of such constituent corporation that, absent this subsection, would
be required to adopt the agreement of merger by this chapter and by the
certificate of incorporation of such constituent corporation;

(4) At the time such constituent corporation\'s board of directors approves
the agreement of merger, no other party to such agreement is an "interested
stockholder" (as defined in § 203(c) of this title) of such constituent
corporation;

(5) The corporation consummating the offer described in paragraph (h)(2) of
this section merges with or into such constituent corporation pursuant to such
agreement; and

(6) The outstanding shares of each class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation not to be canceled in the merger are to be converted in such
merger into, or into the right to receive, the same amount and kind of cash,
property, rights or securities paid for shares of such class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation upon consummation of the offer referred
to in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

If an agreement of merger is adopted without the vote of stockholders of a
corporation pursuant to this subsection, the secretary or assistant secretary
of the surviving corporation shall certify on the agreement that the agreement
has been adopted pursuant to this subsection and that the conditions specified
in this subsection (other than the condition listed in paragraph (h)(5) of
this section) have been satisfied; provided that such certification on the
agreement shall not be required if a certificate of merger is filed in lieu of
filing the agreement. The agreement so adopted and certified shall then be
filed and shall become effective, in accordance with § 103 of this title. Such
filing shall constitute a representation by the person who executes the
agreement that the facts stated in the certificate remain true immediately
prior to such filing. 



Annex III

Delaware General Corporation Law: Section 262

§ 262\. Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder\'s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily
meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or
other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more
shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g)
of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of
this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this
title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of
stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts 

at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on
a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be
available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation\'s certificate of
incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of
this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation", and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation".

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder\'s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder\'s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\'s
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder 

electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), §
253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §
251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the tender or
exchange offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the
date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\'s shares. Such demand will
be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal
of such holder\'s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date
of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the
surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such
holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however,
that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of
this title, later than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending
of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder
who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder\'s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given. 

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder\'s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written
request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\'s written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever
is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\'s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the
addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and
by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be
borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder. 

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on
the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\'s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\'s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\'s fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal
of such stockholder\'s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger
or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter
with the written approval of the 

corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of
Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\'s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set
forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.





Exhibit C



Escrow Agreement



INDEMNITY ESCROW AGREEMENT

THIS INDEMNITY ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of [___], 2015
by and among First Financial Bank, National Association, a national bank
organized under the Laws of the United States (the "Purchaser"), AG-OSF
Holdings LLC, a limited liability company organized under the Laws of the
State of Delaware (the "Stockholders' Representative") and U.S. Bank National
Association, a national banking association, as escrow agent (the "Escrow
Agent"). The Purchaser, the Stockholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent
are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Parties" and
individually as a "Party." Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Stockholders' Representative are parties to
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 23, 2015 (as the
same may be amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time in
accordance with its terms, the "Merger Agreement");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and as part of the
transactions contemplated thereby, the parties thereto agreed to enter into
this Agreement and deliver the Escrow Amount (as defined below) to the Escrow
Agent for the purposes set forth herein;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto
agreed that the Escrow Funds (as defined below) shall be the source of funds
for the satisfaction of amounts that may become payable to the Purchaser by
the Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) under the Merger
Agreement during the term of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser desire to create
an escrow account for the Escrow Amount and appoint the Escrow Agent as the
escrow agent for such account upon the terms and conditions set forth below;
and

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a closing deliverable
under the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties to this Agreement
hereby agree as set forth below.

1. Appointment of the Escrow Agent. The Purchaser and the Stockholders' Representative hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent under and pursuant to the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the duties thereof subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement. 

2. Escrow Deposit. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser has deposited with the Escrow Agent cash in the amount of $7,500,000 in accordance with Section 1.2(e)(iv) of the Merger Agreement (the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount and agrees to hold the Escrow Amount, 

together with all products and proceeds thereof (including all interest,
dividend, gains and other income earned with respect thereto (collectively,
the "Escrow Funds")), in a separate and distinct account (the "Escrow
Account"), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall not distribute or release the Escrow Funds except in accordance
with the express terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3. Permitted Investments. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to establish and maintain the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account and shall invest the Escrow Funds as jointly directed by the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser, from time to time, in writing, in money market accounts and money market mutual funds (including those of the Escrow Agent), treasury bills, treasury notes or any other direct obligations issued by or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America, certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $1,000,000,000 (including the Escrow Agent and its affiliates) and interest-bearing demand accounts of the Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Permitted Investments") as soon as reasonably practical upon receiving such direction. Neither the Purchaser nor the Stockholders' Representative shall be liable or responsible in any manner for any Loss or depreciation resulting from any such Permitted Investment or any liquidation thereof, or for any costs in connection therewith, and all of said Losses and costs shall be borne by the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent shall have no power or authority to invest or reinvest any Escrow Funds except as jointly instructed by the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Escrow Agent has not received instructions from the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser as to investment of the Escrow Funds within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Agent's U.S. Bank Money Market Fund.

4. Release of Escrow Funds. The Escrow Funds shall be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent as follows:

(a) Indemnification Claims. At any time, and from time to time prior to [ ],
2016 (the "Survival Date"), if the Purchaser desires to make a claim pursuant
to Section 7.3 of the Merger Agreement for which the Escrow Funds may be used
to satisfy such claim, then the Purchaser shall deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative a written notice (an "Indemnification Notice") setting forth
the amount of such claim for payment (an "Indemnification Claim") and setting
forth the applicable section of the Merger Agreement under which such
Indemnification Claim is made. The Purchaser shall also deliver to the Escrow
Agent proof of delivery to the Stockholders' Representative of such
Indemnification Notice (which proof may consist of a photocopy of the
registered or certified mail or overnight courier receipt or the signed
receipt if delivered by hand). If the Escrow Agent has not received a written
objection to such Indemnification Claim from the Stockholders' Representative
within ten (10) business days following the Escrow Agent's receipt of such
proof of delivery to the Stockholders' Representative, then on the tenth
business day following such receipt, the Escrow Agent shall release, by wire
transfer to the account or accounts designated by the Purchaser in the
Indemnification Notice, an amount of Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account
equal to the amount of such Indemnification Claim.



(b) Disputes. If the Stockholders' Representative in good faith delivers to
the Escrow Agent and the Purchaser a written objection (a "Dispute Notice") to
any Indemnification Claim or portion thereof within ten (10) business days
following the Escrow Agent's receipt of proof of delivery of such
Indemnification Notice, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 4(c)
below, the Escrow Agent shall not distribute to the Purchaser any Escrow Funds
that are the subject of the Dispute Notice until the Escrow Agent receives
either (i) joint written instructions signed by the Stockholders'
Representative and the Purchaser authorizing the release to the Purchaser of
the Escrow Funds that are the subject of the Dispute Notice or (ii) a copy of
a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, or arbitral award directing
the release to the Purchaser of the Escrow Funds that are the subject of the
Dispute Notice. Upon receipt of such joint written instructions or a copy of
such final decision or binding arbitral award, as the case may be, the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Purchaser the Escrow Funds subject to dispute in
accordance with such joint written instructions or decision or arbitral award.
In the event that the Stockholders' Representative is the prevailing party in
whole or in part in connection with any such dispute, the portion of the
Escrow Funds that were the subject of such Dispute Notice and that are not
released to the Purchaser as provided in the immediately preceding sentence
shall remain in the Escrow Account and shall be available to satisfy other
Indemnification Claims until released as provided in Section 4(d) below. Any
Dispute Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any objection
to the matters set forth in the Indemnification Notice and the portion of such
Indemnification Claim (if less than all) which is the subject of such Dispute
Notice.

(c) Partial Release. If any Dispute Notice includes an objection to only a
portion of an Indemnification Claim and either acknowledges or does not
specifically dispute the release of the remaining portion set forth in the
Indemnification Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to the
Purchaser an amount of Escrow Funds equal to the portion of the
Indemnification Claim that is so acknowledged or not specifically disputed;
provided, that no such partial release by the Escrow Agent shall terminate or
otherwise prejudice the Purchaser's rights with respect to the remainder of
any Indemnification Claim set forth in an Indemnification Notice.

(d) Release of Remaining Escrow Funds.

(i) No later than five (5) business days following the Survival Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the Stockholders' Representative the remaining
balance of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account as of the Survival Date
(together with all Income (as defined below)), less the amount of all
Unresolved Claims. "Unresolved Claims" shall mean the aggregate amount of all
Losses claimed by the Purchaser in accordance with Section 7.3 of the Merger
Agreement which are unsatisfied pursuant to Indemnification Notices previously
delivered. The Stockholders' Representative or the Purchaser may give the
Escrow Agent notice of the occurrence of the Survival Date; provided, that the
Party delivering such notice provides a copy of such notice to the other
Parties.

(ii) Promptly upon the Escrow Agent's receipt of a signed agreement of the
Purchaser and the Stockholders' Representative or the determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction or the arbitrator, as the case may be, of any
Unresolved Claims that



are the subject of a Dispute Notice or upon the expiration of the ten (10)
business day objection period for any Unresolved Claims for which no Dispute
Notice has been delivered, the Escrow Agent shall release by wire transfer to
an account or accounts designated by the Purchaser an amount of Escrow Funds
equal to the amount of Escrow Funds to be released to the Purchaser pursuant
to such signed agreement or such final determination or the amount of such
Unresolved Claim for which no Dispute Notice has been delivered, as the case
may be. After the resolution of any Unresolved Claim, a portion of any
remaining Escrow Funds in excess of the amount of the remaining Unresolved
Claims (if any) (together with an any Income) shall be released promptly
thereafter by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders' Representative.

(e) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate when all of the Escrow Funds
in the Escrow Account have been released and distributed in accordance with
this Section 4. Upon such termination, this Agreement shall have no further
force and effect, except that the provisions of this Section 4(e) and Sections
5, 6, 7, and Sections 9 through 21 below shall survive such termination.

5. Conditions to Escrow. The Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser agree that the Escrow Agent shall not assume any responsibility for the failure of such Parties to perform in accordance with the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. The acceptance by the Escrow Agent of its responsibilities hereunder is subject to the following terms and conditions which the Parties agree shall govern and control with respect to the Escrow Agent's rights, duties and liabilities hereunder:

(a) Documents. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document furnished
to it, not only as to its due execution and validity and the effectiveness of
its provisions, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information
therein contained, which the Escrow Agent in good faith believes to be genuine
and what it purports to be. Should it be necessary for the Escrow Agent to act
upon any instructions, directions, documents or instruments issued or signed
by or on behalf of any Person acting on behalf of the Purchaser or the
Stockholders' Representative, it shall not be necessary for the Escrow Agent
to inquire into such Person's authority. The Escrow Agent is also relieved
from the necessity of satisfying itself as to the authority of the Persons
executing this Agreement in a representative capacity on behalf of the
Stockholders' Representative or the Purchaser.

(b) Liability. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission
taken or suffered in good faith with respect to this Agreement unless such act
or omission is the result of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Escrow Agent.

(c) Legal Counsel. The Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from,
legal counsel in the event of any question as to any of the provisions hereof
or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no Liability and shall be fully
protected in acting in good faith in accordance with the opinion and
instructions of such counsel.



(d) Limitation of Duties. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those
which are expressly set forth herein and it shall not be bound by any
agreement of the other Parties hereto (whether or not it has any knowledge
thereof).

(e) Resignation or Termination of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
have the right to resign at any time by giving written notice of such
resignation to the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser and the
Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser shall have the right to
terminate the services of the Escrow Agent hereunder at any time by giving
written notice (with such written notice being signed by the Purchaser and the
Stockholders' Representative) of such termination to the Escrow Agent, in each
case specifying the effective date of such resignation or termination. If
within thirty (30) days after receiving or delivering either of the aforesaid
notices, as the case may be, the Purchaser and the Stockholders'
Representative appoint a successor escrow agent, and such successor escrow
agent accepts such appointment, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrow
Funds less the amount of any fees owing to the Escrow Agent hereunder as of
such date to such successor escrow agent. If a successor escrow agent has not
been appointed and has not accepted such appointment by the end of such thirty
(30) day period, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent, and each of the
Purchaser and the Stockholders' Representative shall be liable for one-half of
the costs, expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Escrow
Agent in connection with any such proceeding. Any successor escrow agent shall
be a banking corporation or trust company having total assets in excess of
$1,000,000,000. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Stockholders'
Representative and the Purchaser, no Escrow Funds shall be released from the
Escrow Account unless and until a successor escrow agent has (i) been
appointed in accordance with this Section 5(e) and (ii) agreed, in writing, to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. After any such
appointment, such successor escrow agent shall be the "Escrow Agent"
hereunder.

(f) Discharge of the Escrow Agent. Upon delivery of all of the Escrow Funds
pursuant to the terms of Section 4 above or to a successor escrow agent in
accordance with Section 5(e), the Escrow Agent shall thereafter be discharged
from any further obligations hereunder. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized,
in any and all events, to comply with and obey any and all final judgments,
orders and decrees of any court of competent jurisdiction which may be filed,
entered or issued, and all final arbitration awards and, if it shall so comply
or obey, it shall not be liable to any other Person by reason of such
compliance or obedience.

6. Indemnification. The Purchaser and the Stockholders' Representative, jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent for and to hold it harmless against any Losses or reasonable expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and documented out-of-pocket expenses) incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Escrow Agent arising out of or in connection with its performance under this Agreement. Any indemnification payable to the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be payable one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the Stockholders' Representative.

7. Escrow Costs. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to be paid a fee for its services pursuant to the Fee Schedule attached as Schedule I and to be reimbursed for its reasonable costs 



and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with maintaining
the Escrow Account hereunder, which fees, costs and documented out-of-pocket
expenses shall be paid one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the
Stockholders' Representative.

8. Limitations on Rights to Escrow Funds. None of the Parties shall have any right, title or interest in or to, or possession of, the Escrow Account and therefore shall not have the ability to pledge, convey, hypothecate or grant as security all or any portion of the Escrow Funds, unless and until such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to Section 4 above. Accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall be in sole possession of the Escrow Funds and shall not act as custodian of the Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser under this Agreement for the purposes of perfecting a security interest therein, and no creditor of any of the Parties shall have any right to have or to hold or otherwise attach or seize all or any portion of the Escrow Funds as collateral for any obligation and shall not be able to obtain a security interest in any of the Escrow Funds unless and until such Escrow Funds have been released pursuant to Section 4 above.

9. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service or by facsimile to the Parties at the following addresses:

written consent of the other Parties. No course of dealing between or among

12. Taxation of Interest Earned on Investment of Escrow Amount. The Stockholders' Representative and the Purchaser agree that, for federal and state income tax purposes, the Stockholders' Representative will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Funds and will report all interest, dividends, or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Amount (the "Income") as the Stockholders' Representative's income in the taxable year or years in which such Income is properly includable and pay or cause to be paid any taxes attributable thereto. Any such Income shall not be a part of the Escrow Funds from which it was earned or derived from. The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for reporting any Income earned to the Internal Revenue Service.

13. No Other Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give any Person other than the Escrow Agent, the Parties and their permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

14. Interpretation. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be a part of or control or affect the meaning hereof.

15. No Waiver. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any right of further exercise or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The right of the Purchaser or the Stockholders' Representative to receive all or a portion of the Escrow Funds under the circumstances described in Section 4 above is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies that any such Party may have against the other pursuant to the Merger Agreement in the event of a breach of the Merger Agreement.

16. Severability. The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever the provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions shall be automatically replaced by other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions, but are valid and enforceable and (c) the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

17. No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their collective mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The term "including" as used herein shall be by 



way of example, and shall not be deemed to constitute a limitation of any term
or provision contained herein. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

18. Releases on Non-Business Days. In the event that a release of Escrow Funds hereunder is required to be made on a date that is not a business day, such release may be made on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made when required.

19. Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. In furtherance of the foregoing, the internal Law of the State of New York shall control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement, even though under that jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.

20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties individually or in any combination, in one or more counterparts (including by means of telecopied, e-mailed or other means of electronically transmitted signature pages), each of which shall be an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same agreement.

21. Identifying Information. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.
