the merits and risks of his or her investment in RSD. Each DGH Shareholder
has the financial ability to bear the economic risks of his or her entire
investment in RSD for an indefinite period, would be able to sustain a
complete loss of his or her investment, and has no need for liquidity with
respect to his or her investment in RSD.

 

 

Section 5.7 Investment Intent.

 



 

The shares of Common Stock are being acquired by each DGH Shareholder for
each DGH Shareholder\'s own account for investment purposes only, not as a
nominee or agent and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any
part thereof, and each DGH Shareholder has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in or otherwise distributing the same. Each DGH
Shareholder further represents that the DGH Shareholder does not have any
contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell,
transfer or grant participation to such person or third person with respect
to any of DGH Shares.

 

 

Section 5.8 Restrictions on Transfer.

 



 

Each DGH Shareholder understands that the shares of Common Stock have not
been registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under any
foreign or state securities law, and may not be, directly or indirectly,
sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and registration or
qualification under applicable state securities laws or the availability of
an exemption therefrom. In any case where such an exemption is relied upon by
each DGH Shareholder from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and the registration or qualification requirements of such state securities
laws, each DGH Shareholder shall furnish RSD with an opinion of counsel
stating that the proposed sale or other disposition of such securities may be
effected without registration under the Securities Act and will not result in
any violation of any applicable state securities laws relating to the
registration or qualification of securities for sale, such counsel and
opinion to be satisfactory to RSD. Each DGH Shareholder acknowledges that it
is able to bear the economic risks of an investment in the Common Stock for
an indefinite period of time, and that its overall commitment to investments
that are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to its net worth.

 



 

Section 5.9 Informed Investment.

 



 

Each DGH Shareholder has made such investigations in connection herewith as
it deemed necessary or desirable so as to make an informed investment
decision without relying upon DGH for legal or tax advice related to this
investment. In making its decision to acquire the Common Stock, each DGH
Shareholder has not relied upon any information other than information
contained in this Agreement and in the other Offering Documents.

Each DGH Shareholder acknowledges that it has had access to and has reviewed
all documents and records relating to RSD, including, but not limited to, the
RSD SEC Documents, that it has deemed necessary in order to make an
informed investment decision with respect to an investment in RSD; that it
has had the opportunity to ask representatives of RSD certain questions and
request certain additional information regarding the terms and conditions of
such investment and the finances, operations, business and prospects of RSD
and has had any and all such questions and requests answered to its
satisfaction; and that based on the foregoing it understands the risks and
other considerations relating to an investment in RSD.

 



 

Section 5.11 Reliance on Representations.

 



 

Each DGH Shareholder understands that the shares of Common Stock are being
offered and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the
registration and/or public offering requirements of the U.S. federal and
state securities laws and that RSD and DGH is relying in part upon the truth
and accuracy of, and such DGH Shareholder\'s compliance with, the
representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings
of such DGH Shareholder set forth herein in order to determine the
availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of such DGH Shareholder
to acquire the Common Stock. Each DGH Shareholder represents and warrants to
RSD and DGH that any information the DGH Shareholder has heretofore furnished
or furnishes herewith to RSD and DGH is complete and accurate, and further
represents and warrants that it will notify and supply corrective information
to RSD and DGH immediately upon the occurrence of any change therein
occurring prior to DGH\'s issuance of the Common Stock. Within five (5) days
after receipt of a request from DGH, each DGH Shareholder will provide such
information and such documents as may reasonably be necessary to comply with
any and all laws and regulations to which DGH is subject.

 



 

Section 5.12 No General Solicitation.

 



 

Each DGH Shareholder is unaware of, and in deciding to participate in the
transactions contemplated hereby is in no way relying upon, and did not
become aware of the transactions contemplated hereby through or as a result
of, any form of general solicitation or general advertising including,
without limitation, any article, notice, advertisement or other communication

television or radio or the internet, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.13 Representation by Counsel.

 



 

Each DGH Shareholder represents that it is represented by their own counsel
in this transaction and that such counsel has carefully reviewed with it the
terms and legal consequences of the Exchange and, in particular, the Tax
consequences of the Exchange to such DGH Shareholder. DGH and each DGH
Shareholder acknowledges and understands that Michael Paige PLLC, Counsel to

(collectively, "Claims") suffered by such Indemnified Party resulting from or

accountants and employees (each an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any
and all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, judgments, assessments,
losses, liabilities, damages or penalties and reasonable attorneys\' fees and
related disbursements (collectively, "Claims") suffered by such Indemnified
Party resulting from or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any

Section 11.3 Indemnification Procedures.

 



 

(a) Upon obtaining knowledge of any Claim by a third party which has given
rise to, or is expected to give rise to, a claim for indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice ("Notice of
Claim") of such claim or demand to the Indemnifying Party, specifying in
reasonable detail such information as the Indemnified Party may have with
respect to such indemnification claim (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on it and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same). No failure or delay by the Indemnified Party in the performance of the
foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of the Indemnifying
Party to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Party harmless, except to the
extent that such failure or delay shall have actually adversely affected the
Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend against, settle or satisfy any Claims
for which the Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page 20  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof is a claim or demand
asserted by a third party, the Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15)
days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given to notify Indemnified
Party in writing of their election to defend such third party claim or demand
on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend such third party claim or demand, Indemnified Party shall make
available to the Indemnifying Party and its agents and representatives all
records and other materials that are reasonably required in the defense of
such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise cooperate with, and
assist the Indemnifying Party in the defense of, such third party claim or
demand. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending such third party claim
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, settle or compromise such
third party claim or demand. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such
third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of such third party claim or demand, at
such Indemnified Party\'s own expense. In the event, however, that such
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by counsel to the
Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party
could reasonably be expected to present counsel with a conflict of interest,
then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel to represent or defend
it in any such action or proceeding and the Indemnifying Party will pay the
fees and expenses of such counsel. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect
to defend such third party claim or demand or does not defend such third
party claim or demand in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
Indemnifying Party\'s expense, to defend such third party claim or demand;
provided, however, that (i) such Indemnified Party shall not have any
obligation to participate in the defense of, or defend, any such third party
claim or demand; (ii) such Indemnified Party\'s defense of or its
participation in the defense of any such third party claim or demand shall
not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under the agreements of indemnification set forth in this Article XI; and
(iii) such Indemnified Party may not settle any claim without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party and the other Indemnified Parties, if any, shall
cooperate fully in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial in
respect of which indemnity is sought pursuant to this Article VIII,
including, but not limited to, by providing the other party with reasonable
access to employees and officers (including as witnesses) and other
information.

 



 

(d) Except for third party claims being defended in good faith, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations under this Article XI in
respect of a valid claim for indemnification hereunder that is not contested
by DGH in good faith in cash within thirty (30) days after the date on which
Notice of Claim is given.

 

 

Section 11.4 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims.

 



 

In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
against the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a
claim by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver notice
of such claim to the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail.
The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have
to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
has been actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days following
its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim,
such claim specified by the Indemnifying Party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article
XI and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand, or in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the claim is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim
is finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with
respect to such claim in a timely manner, DGH and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant
to Section 13.11.

 

 

Section 11.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

 



 

No claim for indemnification under this Article XI shall be asserted by, and
no liability for such indemnify shall be enforced against, the Indemnifying
Party to the extent the Indemnified Party has theretofore received
indemnification or otherwise been compensated for such Claim. In the event
that an Indemnified Party shall later collect any such amounts recovered
under insurance policies with respect to any Claim for which it has
previously received payments under this Article XI from the Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party
such amount recovered.
