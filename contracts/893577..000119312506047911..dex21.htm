material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of  



 

\- 25 -  circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an

their obligations hereunder by such compliance.

(including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Company

SECTION 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and
the Representatives of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and
its Representatives, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance
with this Section 7.03, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and all
other financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the  



 

\- 58 -  foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall (i) contact
or have any discussions with any of the Companys employees, agents,
or representatives, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written
consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) contact
or have any discussions with any of the landlords/sublandlords,
tenants/subtenants, or licensees or franchisees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ , that
clauses (i) and (ii) shall not be applicable to contacts or discussions not
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be
applicable to contacts and discussions with the Companys executive officers
or its financial advisors, or (iii) damage any property or any portion
thereof. Without limiting the provisions of this Section 7.03(a) and subject
to any rights of tenants under Company Leases, Parent and its Representatives
shall have the right to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering
inspections of each of the Company Properties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Buyer Parties nor their Representatives shall have the right to
take and analyze any samples of any environmental media (including soil,

perform any invasive testing procedure on any building. Parent shall schedule
and coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the
inspection or materials that Parent or its representatives intend to conduct.
The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at all
times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company or the Subsidiaries or contravene
any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
( _provided_ that the Company and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the applicable Third Party or enter
into a customary joint defense agreement to enable the disclosure of such
information). No investigation conducted under this Section 7.03, however,
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in
this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by
Parent pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the confidentiality agreement dated February 10, 2006 between Blackstone
Real Estate Acquisitions V L.L.C., the Operating Partnership and the Company
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

SECTION 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

(a) Subject to Section 7.04(c), none of the Company, the Operating
Partnership, or any other Subsidiary shall, nor shall it authorize or
permit, directly or indirectly, any Representative of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any other Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by
way of furnishing nonpublic information or assistance) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or other action that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an
Acquisition Proposal or release any Person from any standstill agreement or
similar obligation to the Company or any Subsidiary other than the automatic
termination of standstill obligations pursuant to the terms of agreements as
in effect as of the date hereof, by virtue of the execution and announcement
of this Agreement or otherwise,  



 

\- 59 -  (iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in any manner
adverse to any Buyer Party, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) enter into any agreement in principle,
arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall take, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to take,
all actions reasonably necessary to cause their respective Representatives to
immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or communications with any
party or parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 7.04 shall preclude the Company, the Operating
Partnership or their respective Representatives from contacting any such party
or parties solely for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the last
sentence of this Section 7.04(a). The Company and the Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for any failure on the part of their respective Representatives to
comply with this Section 7.04(a). The Company and the Operating Partnership
shall promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal, if any, to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of the Company
or any Subsidiary.

(b) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall promptly notify Parent
(but in no event less than twenty-four hours following the Companys or any
Subsidiarys initial receipt) of an Acquisition Proposal or indication by any
Person considering making an Acquisition Proposal, any request for information
relating to the Company or any Subsidiaries (other than requests for
information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal) or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal which any of the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their Representatives may receive after the date hereof. Such notification
shall include relevant details relating to any of the foregoing, including the
identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request and any related communications to or by the Company, any
Subsidiary or their Representatives (or, if not in writing, a written
description thereof). The Company and the Operating Partnership shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis as to the status of and any
material developments regarding any such proposal, indication, inquiry or
request. None of the Company or any Subsidiary shall, after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit them
from providing such information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall
not permit any Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company
or any Subsidiary is a party and the Company shall, and shall cause each
Subsidiary to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

(c) Subject to the Company Parties compliance with the provisions of this
Section 7.04, and only prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, following
the receipt by the Company or any Subsidiary of a written Acquisition
Proposal, the Company Board may (directly or through Representatives) (I)
contact such Person and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying the
proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions to consummation, so
as to determine whether the proposal for an Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (II) if the Company
Board determines in good faith following consultation with its legal and
financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, the Company Board thereafter may (i) furnish
non-public information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such proposal (provided that the Company (A) has previously
or concurrently furnished such information to  



 

\- 60 -  Parent and (B) shall furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement which is at least as favorable to the Company as
the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding
such proposal, (iii) following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, recommend that the Companys stockholders
approve such Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, the Company
Recommendation, or (iv) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, the
Company Recommendation (any event described in this clause (iv) or clause
(iii) above, a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") but in each case referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) only if, after complying with this Section 7.04(c),
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. Nothing
in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the Company stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, including Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A;
provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be
permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation, unless in each case the requirements of the prior sentence of
this Section 7.04(c) have been satisfied.

(d) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions contained in Article V of the Company Charter or otherwise cause
any of such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken in
connection with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
9.01(h).

SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) The Company has provided Parent with all of the severance, change-in-
control and similar obligations that are payable by their terms upon

From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all
severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to any applicable
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary any amounts with respect
to such agreements. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with
their terms any other employment related contracts, agreements arrangements
and commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries in effect immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time that are applicable to any current
or former employees or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their predecessors.

(b) For a period of not less than twelve months after the Closing Date, with
respect to each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "
_Company Employees_ ") who remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or
its successors or assigns  



 

\- 61 -  or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
Continuing Employees with (i) (A) base salary and (B) cash incentive
compensation (excluding any cash bonuses or dividend equivalent payments
related to equity or equity-based awards) and in each case in an amount at
least equal to the same level that was provided to each such Continuing
Employee or to which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
any equity-based benefits), that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee will be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under any new parallel
employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employee become entitled to participate to the same extent as such employee
was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under the
respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits and except with respect to benefit accrual under a
defined benefit plan). In addition, with respect to any such health benefit
plan in which the Continuing Employee become entitled to participate during
the calendar year that includes the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
shall be given credit for amounts paid by the employee under the respective
Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or
options to acquire Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the
Company Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

(d) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate the Companys
Director Deferred Compensation Plan, Executive Deferred Compensation Plan,
deferred restricted share unit arrangements and all other share or investment-
based non-qualified deferred compensation account-based arrangements
(collectively, the " _Non-Qualified Account Plans_ "), in a manner that is
compliant with Section 409A of the Code. Such action shall be contingent upon,
and effective as of, the Company Merger Effective Time. Payment of the Non-
Qualified Account Plans shall be in cash to the participants in the Non-
Qualified Account Plans in a single lump-sum payment by the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time;
provided, however, that payment shall be delayed to the date six months
following a participants separation from service in the event, and to the
extent, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time the Board of Directors of
the Company determines that such delay is necessary to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,

and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement)
resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of each of the

on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with

is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of

charter and bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Company
Charter, Company Bylaws or the applicable organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, were directors,
officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries (including fiduciaries
under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA)) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such
modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law.

(c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at
least six (6) years the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and employed lawyer liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, that (i) that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies (including run-off or "tail" policies) of at
least the same amounts and containing other terms and conditions which are,
in the aggregate, not materially less advantageous to the insured persons,
provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage
with respect to matters occurring before the Company Merger Effective Time;
(ii) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 7.06(c) more than an amount per year of coverage
equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance. The Company represents that such annual
premium amount is set forth in Section 7.06(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. In
the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more than three hundred
percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred percent
(300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all
obligations thereunder.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-
up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assumes
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06. 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.06 and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.06.

SECTION 7.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 7.01, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
shall (i) make promptly its respective filings and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act and any other Law with respect to
this Agreement and the Mergers, if required, and (ii) use its reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable efforts to
obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of Governmental Authorities with the Company and the Subsidiaries as
are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 7.07, including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject
to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all
related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing,
and, to the extent practicable, none of the parties will file any such
document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without
prior consultation with the other party. Each party shall keep the other
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable
and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit
representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and calls with
such Governmental Authority. None of the parties shall consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including
administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed,  



 

\- 65 -  terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part
restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers,
including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal.

(d) Each of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on
the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material
Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. In
the event that any Company Party shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties
and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result, after the Company Merger Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless required by the applicable
agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, none of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall
pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) none of the Buyer
Parties or their respective affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to
pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation.

SECTION 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together
with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer
Taxes. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding
from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common
Shares, Company Share Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted
Share Units and/or SVUs, all Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 7.09 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Mergers) shall be issued by a party without the
prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the Mergers and the execution of this
Agreement.



 

\- 66 - SECTION 7.10 _Cooperation with Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and
(ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such
definitive agreements that are within their control. In the event any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources
on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or any termination
of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting with the Company
or, if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to materially and
adversely affect or delay in any material respect Parents ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without first
obtaining the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or
any alternative financing) has not been obtained, the Buyer Parties shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Mergers on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this Agreement and to
Parents rights under Section 9.01, regardless of whether the Buyer
Parties have complied with all of their other obligations under this
Agreement (including their obligations under this Section 7.10).

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing
sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to
complete the Mergers and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for any debt raised by Parent to complete the Mergers, (v) forming
new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (vi) providing and executing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and (vii) without limiting the
obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries under Sections 3.07 and 3.08,
cooperating in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any Indebtedness
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as of the Partnership Mergers
Effective  



 

\- 67 -  Time, including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under
any existing mortgage or mezzanine loans of the Company or any Subsidiary
as requested by Parent; _provided_ that none of the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs or incur any other liability
in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Partnership Mergers Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives in connection with
such cooperation. The Buyer Parties shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 8.02(b), as it
applies to the Companys obligations under this Section 7.10(b), shall be
deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has
not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys or the Subsidiaries
willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section 7.10(b).

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b) above
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 7.11  _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Partnership
Mergers Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any Subsidiary
designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least five calendar days
prior to the Closing.

SECTION 7.12  _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties and their respective
boards of directors (or managing members or general partners, as applicable)
shall (a) take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b)
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute.



 

\- 68 - SECTION 7.13 _Delisting and Deregistering of Securities_. Parent and the
Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company
Common Shares to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act promptly following the Company Merger Effective Time.

SECTION 7.14 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:

(a) continue to operate in such a manner as to permit the Company to continue
to qualify as a REIT throughout the period from the date hereof to
the Company Merger Effective Time;

(b) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or
before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws;

(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed;

consistent with past practice; and

(e) terminate all Tax sharing agreements to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party such that there are no further liabilities
thereunder (provided that the foregoing does not apply to existing Tax
Protection Agreements).

SECTION 7.15 _Notices of Certain Events_.

(a) The Company Parties shall notify Parent promptly of (i) any written
communication and, to the knowledge of the Company, any other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, any
of the Subsidiaries or their Representatives), (ii) any communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries or their Representatives), (iii) any material Actions threatened

Subsidiaries that are related to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or (iv) any effect, event, development or change between the date

reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(a) or
8.02(b) not to be satisfied.

(b) The Buyer Parties shall notify the Company promptly of (i) any written
communication and, to the knowledge of Parent, any other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from Parent, any of its subsidiaries or
their Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the response  



 

\- 69 -  thereto from Parent, any of its subsidiaries or their Representatives),
(iii) any material Actions threatened or commenced against or
otherwise affecting Parent or any of its subsidiaries that are related to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or (iv) any effect, event,

(b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated:

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.01(f) or
by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d) (however, only in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 9.01(d) that relates to a breach by the
Company Parties of their obligations under Section 7.02 or Section 7.04) and
(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company Parties or
publicly announced prior to such Termination Date (and with respect to
termination pursuant to Section 9.01(b), such Acquisition Proposal was not
withdrawn prior to the Termination Date), and (B) concurrently with such
termination or within twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, the
Company enters into a Contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not
such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in
the foregoing clause (A)), then the Company shall pay to Parent, if and when
such Contract is entered into or consummation of such Acquisition Proposal
occurs, as applicable, the Company Termination Fee and the reasonable
Expenses of the Buyer Parties not to exceed $7,500,000 (" _Parent Expenses_ ")
(and for purposes of this Section 9.03(b)(i), "50%" shall be substituted for
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal); or

(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g), or the Company pursuant
to Section 9.01(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee and Parent Expenses on the Termination Date, and with respect
to a termination pursuant to Section 9.01(h), such payment shall be made
before or concurrently with such termination and shall be a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 9.03(b)(ii) for termination by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(h), the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses
shall be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing in immediately
available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date of the event
giving rise to the obligation to make such payment.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an
amount equal to $85 million.

(e) Subject to Section 10.06, if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(e), Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3)
Business Days after the date of termination, the reasonable Expenses of the
Company Parties not to exceed $7,500,000 (the " _Company Expenses_ "). If
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  



 

\- 75 -  Section 9.01(d), the Company shall pay to Parent, within three (3) Business
Days after the date of termination, the Parent Expenses. Subject to Section
10.06, the payment of Company Expenses or Parent Expenses set forth in this
Section 9.03 is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to any other
rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law or in
equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to constitute
liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in
any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach of
this Agreement. 

(f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the
Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this Section 9.03.

SECTION 9.04 _Escrow_.

(a) To the extent that the Company Parties recover money damages pursuant to
and subject to Section 10.06 and the Guarantee (the " _Damages Amount_ "),
Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to pay to the Operating Partnership
from the Damages Amount deposited into escrow in accordance with the next
sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Damages Amount and (ii) the
sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Operating Partnership
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H)
or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by
the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event
the Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel
indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in
Section 9.04(b) or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as
described in Section 9.04(b), an amount equal to the Damages Amount less the
amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay
these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Damages Amount with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such
terms (subject to Section 9.04(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Operating Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent. Subject to the terms of
Section 10.06 and the Guarantee, the payment or deposit into escrow of the
Damages Amount pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall be made at the time Parent
is obligated to pay the Operating Partnership such amount pursuant to Section
10.06 and the Guarantee by wire transfer or bank check.

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Damages Amount in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Operating Partnership
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Operating Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent
letter from the Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the
escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a  



 

\- 76 -  letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the Damages Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the
Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Operating Partnership of the Damages Amount would constitute
Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify
Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Damages Amount to the Operating Partnership. Parent agrees to
amend this Section 9.04 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to
(x) maximize the portion of the Damages Amount that may be distributed to the
Operating Partnership hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the
Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
9.04(b) or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this Section 9.04(b). The escrow agreement
shall also provide that any portion of the Damages Amount held in escrow for
five years shall be released by the escrow agent to Parent. Any costs and
expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne solely by the Company.

SECTION 9.05 _Waiver_.

At any time prior to the Partnership Mergers Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive
any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to its own
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company (on behalf of the
Company Parties) or Parent (on behalf of the Buyer Parties), as applicable.
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

SECTION 10.03  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of
this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.



 

\- 78 - SECTION 10.04 _Amendment_.

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their
respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any
time prior to the Partnership Mergers Effective Time; provided, however,
that, after approval of the Company Merger by the stockholders of the Company,
no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or
in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_.

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant
to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except any of the Buyer
Parties may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, provided, however, that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if the
assignee does not perform its obligations.

SECTION 10.06 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.07 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a
party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any
other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the
exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise by it of any other remedy. Without limiting the right to receive any
payment it may be entitled to receive under Sections 2.08 and 7.10(b), each
of the Company Parties agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or
damages (including any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to Section 9.03(e)) in
connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer
Parties and Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be limited to an
amount equal to the amount of the Guarantee, and in no event shall the Company
Parties seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from the
Buyer Parties or Guarantor or their respective Representatives and affiliates
in connection therewith.

SECTION 10.07 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this
Agreement were not performed by any Company Party in accordance with the terms
hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company Parties and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties acknowledge that none of the Company Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the
Company Parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach
shall be the remedy set forth in Section 10.06 and the Guarantee;  _provided_
, _however_ , the Company Parties shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to prevent any breach by the Buyer Parties of Sections 7.03(b) and
7.10(c).



 

\- 79 - SECTION 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 7.06 (which
are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or the
persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such persons).

SECTION 10.09 _Governing Law; Forum_. The Company Merger shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland applicable
to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State without regard to
its rules of conflict of laws. Except as provided in the immediately
proceeding sentence, this Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity
or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not
to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each
of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise
subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and
maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail to the address for notice in Section
10.02 with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal
Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a)
or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Delaware.

SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. 

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any
party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.



 

\- 80 - SECTION 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that
no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that
it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.13.
