NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
subject to the conditions set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to

Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "),
and shall concurrently cause the Certificate of Merger, or any other

California, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the CGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon (a)
such filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or (b) such later date and time as may be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (excluding those conditions that, by their nature, are
to be satisfied as of the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions as of the Closing), unless another time or date is agreed
to in writing by the Parties. The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Mayer Brown LLP, 350 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the Parties.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. Nara shall be the Surviving

that such Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to provide that,
effective as of the Effective Time, the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be changed to a name mutually acceptable to Center Financial and Nara.
The By-laws of Nara as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
amended substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit 1.4_ , shall be the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 _Bank Merger_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, Nara and Center Financial shall cause Nara Bank and Center Bank
to enter into a bank merger agreement in substantially the form attached to
this Agreement as _Exhibit 1.5_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "), providing
for the Bank Merger in accordance with Applicable Legal Requirements and the
terms of the Bank Merger Agreement concurrently with or as soon as reasonably
practicable after consummation of the Merger. 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nara, Center Financial or
the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Parties_. Any shares of
Center Financial Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective

 



2  Time and are owned by Center Financial or Nara (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any DPC shares or shares for which Center Financial is the
record holder for the benefit of another Person) shall be cancelled and
retired and no stock of Nara or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Any shares of Nara Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are owned by
Center Financial (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any DPC shares or
shares for which Center Financial is the record holder for the benefit of
another Person) shall be cancelled and retired.

 

(b) _Conversion of Center Financial Common Stock_. Subject to
_Section 2.2(e)_, each share of Center Financial Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with  _Section 2.1(a)_ and dissenting shares as
provided in _Section 2.1(f)_) shall be converted into 0.7804 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Nara Common Stock. None of
such shares of Center Financial Common Stock shall remain outstanding and all
of such shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each stock certificate previously representing any such shares
shall thereafter represent solely the shares of Nara Common Stock into which
such Center Financial Common Stock has been converted and the right pursuant
to _Section 2.2(e)_ to receive payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares, without interest, if applicable. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Exchange Ratio has been determined based upon (i) the
number of shares of Center Financial Common Stock and Center Financial
Restricted Shares and Nara Common Stock and Naras performance units issued
under the Nara Stock Plan (the " _Nara Performance Units_ ") represented and
warranted herein by the respective Parties to be issued and outstanding, in
each case as of November 30, 2010, as set forth in  _Section 3.1(b)(i)_ and
_Sections 3.2(b)(i)_ and _3.2(b)(iii)_ , respectively, and (ii) on a diluted
basis using the treasury stock method, each issued and outstanding Center
Financial Stock Option and Nara Stock Option with an exercise price that was
below the closing price of a share of Nara Common Stock and Center Financial
Common Stock, respectively, as reported on the NASDAQ website at the close of
NASDAQs regular session of trading on December 8, 2010, and represented and
warranted herein by the respective Parties to be issued and outstanding as of
November 30, 2010, as set forth in _Sections 3.1(b)(i)_ and _3.2(b)(i)_. Other
than any increases in outstanding shares of Center Financial Common Stock or
Nara Common Stock resulting from the exercise of Center Financial Stock
Options and Nara Stock Options issued and outstanding as of the date hereof,
if the number of shares of Center Financial Common Stock or Nara Common Stock
or the number of Center Financial Restricted Shares or Nara Performance Units
that are issued and outstanding shall have increased or decreased as of the
Closing, whether as permitted by or in breach of this Agreement, the Parties
agree that, without limiting any other right or remedy to which the Parties
are entitled at law or in equity, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio such that holders of Center Financial Common Stock and
holders of Nara Common Stock shall receive 45% and 55%, respectively, of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation after the
Merger is consummated. The Exchange Ratio, as recalculated, if applicable,
shall, for all purposes hereunder, constitute the "Exchange Ratio."

(c) _Conversion of Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock_.
Each share of Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Nara

 



3  Preferred Stock designated as Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock, Series B (the " _Nara Series B Preferred Stock_ "), which series of
Nara Preferred Stock shall be authorized by action of the board of directors
of Nara (the " _Nara Board_ ") pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Nara as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Nara Board
shall take all necessary action to create the Nara Series B Preferred Stock
prior to the Effective Time. The shares of Nara Series B Preferred Stock shall
have, in respect of Nara, the same rights, preferences, privileges and voting
powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, as the shares of Center
Financial Series A Preferred Stock had in respect of Center Financial
immediately prior to the Effective Time. None of such shares of Center
Financial Series A Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and all of such
shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each stock certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent solely the shares of Nara Series B Preferred Stock into
which such Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock has been converted,
without interest.

 

(d) _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. Unless
otherwise agreed by Center Financial after the date hereof:

(i) _Assumption of Center Financial Options_. Center Financial and
Nara shall take all actions necessary (including delivery of any required
notices by Center Financial) to provide that, effective as of the Effective
Time, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding
Center Financial Stock Option shall cease to represent the right to acquire
shares of Center Financial Common Stock and shall instead be converted
automatically into an option to acquire shares of Nara Common Stock as
provided below (an " _Assumed Option"_ ), and such Assumed Options will be
assumed by Nara on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the corresponding Center Financial Stock Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective
Time:

 

(1) each Assumed Option will be exercisable for a number of shares of
Nara Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Center
Financial Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of such Center
Financial Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
share; and

 

(2) the per share exercise price for the Nara Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing (x) the per share exercise price for such Center Financial Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Any restriction on the exercisability of such Center Financial Stock Option
in effect as of the date hereof will continue in full force and effect, and
the term, exercisability, and vesting schedule of such Center Financial Stock
Option as in effect on the date hereof will remain unchanged. As soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation will deliver to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a

 



4  document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Center Financial Stock
Option by the Surviving Corporation. Center Financial and Nara will cooperate
and coordinate with respect to any materials to be submitted to the holders
of Center Financial Stock Options in connection with any notice required under
this _Section 2.1(d)(i)_.

 

(ii) _Assumption of Center Financial Stock Plan_. By virtue of the
Merger, and without any action by any holders of equity awards, the Surviving
Corporation shall, subject to the foregoing, assume the Center Financial Stock
Plan (the " _Assumed Plan_ "), with such assumption to be effective as of the
Effective Time. Upon and following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be able to grant stock awards, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Legal Requirements and applicable stock exchange listing
regulations, under the terms of the Assumed Plan, to issue the reserved but
unissued shares of Center Financial Common Stock under the Assumed Plan and
the shares that would otherwise return to the Assumed Plan pursuant to the
terms thereof, except that immediately upon the Effective Time, all references
to a number of shares of Center Financial Common Stock will be (A) changed to
references to Nara Common Stock and (B) converted to a number of shares of
Nara Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Center
Financial Common Stock stated in the Center Financial Stock Plan multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation (or a committee thereof) shall,
effective as of the Effective Time, become the administrator of the Assumed
Plan.

(iii) _Center Financial Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time,
each Center Financial Restricted Share then outstanding shall be assumed by
Nara. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Center Financial
Stock Plan and any applicable award or other agreement, each award of Center
Financial Restricted Shares then outstanding shall be converted into the
number of shares of Nara Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Center
Financial Common Stock subject to the Center Financial Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share of Nara Common Stock) (the "
_Assumed Restricted Shares_ "). Except as specifically provided in the
preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, each Assumed Restricted
Shares shall otherwise be subject to the same restrictions, terms and
conditions as were applicable to such shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Center Financial and Nara shall take all steps necessary to
cause the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.1(d)(iii)_ to occur,
including but not limited to delivering all required notices. Center
Financial and Nara will cooperate and coordinate with respect to any materials
to be submitted to the holders of Center Financial Restricted Shares in
connection with any notice required under this  _Section 2.1(d)(iii)_.

(iv) _Violation of Applicable Legal Requirements_. No provision of
_Sections 2.1(d)(i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ shall be implemented with respect
to an individual if such implementation would violate Applicable
Legal Requirements, including those applicable to the Troubled Asset Relief
Program.

 



5 (e) _Warrant_. The Warrant issued on December 12, 2008 to the
United States Department of the Treasury in connection with the issuance of
the Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Center Financial TARP
Warrant_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any Person, cease to be a warrant to purchase Center Financial Common Stock
and will become, automatically in accordance with its terms, a warrant to
purchase Nara Common Stock, and, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any Person, Nara will assume such warrant subject
to its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time:

 

(i) the number of shares of Nara Common Stock purchasable upon
exercise of the Center Financial TARP Warrant will equal the product of (x)
the number of shares of Center Financial Common Stock that were purchasable
pursuant to the Center Financial TARP Warrant immediately before the Effective
Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
(1/100th) of a share; and

(ii) the per share exercise price for the Center Financial TARP Warrant
will equal the quotient of (x) the per share exercise price of the Center
Financial TARP Warrant in effect immediately before the Effective Time and
(y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent.

(f) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Center Financial Stock that have not
been voted in favor of approving the principal terms of the Merger and with
respect to which dissenters rights shall have been properly demanded and may
properly be exercised in accordance with the CGCL shall not be converted as
set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_ at or after the Effective Time unless and
until the holder of such shares withdraws such holders demand for appraisal
in accordance with Applicable Legal Requirements or becomes ineligible for
such appraisal, at which time such shares shall be converted as set forth in
_Section 2.1(b)_, without interest. Center Financial shall give Nara (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for
appraisal and any other instruments in respect thereof received by Center
Financial prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.
Without the prior written consent of Nara, Center Financial shall not make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not settle or
offer to settle any such demands.

 

(g) _Nara Capital Stock_. Each share of Nara Common Stock and each
share of Nara Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding without change
following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation, except as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)_.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Nara shall deposit
or make available to a bank or trust company designated by Nara and reasonably
acceptable to Center Financial (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of Center Financial Common Stock for exchange in accordance with
this _Article II_ , (i) certificates or, at the option of Nara, evidence of
shares in book entry form (collectively " _Nara Certificates_ ") representing
the shares 

 



6  of Nara Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in exchange for
such shares of Center Financial Common Stock and (ii) sufficient cash to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of shares of
Center Financial Common Stock of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time whose shares were converted into shares of Nara Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that, with
respect to Center Financial Certificates, delivery shall be effected and risk
of loss and title to the Center Financial Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Center Financial Certificates and such letter of transmittal
to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Nara and Center Financial may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Center Financial
Certificates or Center Financial Common Stock held in book entry form, as
applicable, in exchange for Nara Certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Nara Common Stock into which such Center Financial Common Stock has
been so converted. Upon surrender of a Center Financial Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal or
submission of a letter of transmittal in respect of shares of Center
Financial Common Stock in book entry form, as applicable, duly executed, and
such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder
of such Center Financial Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a Nara Certificate representing that number of whole shares
of Nara Common Stock, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Center Financial Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ (after taking into account all shares of Center Financial
Common Stock then held by such holder), and the Center Financial Common Stock
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Center Financial Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Center Financial, a Nara Certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Nara Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if
a duly executed letter of transmittal accompanied, in the case of Center
Financial Common Stock in certificated form, by the relevant Center Financial
Certificate representing such Center Financial Common Stock, is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Center Financial Certificate and each book entry in respect of Common Stock
in book entry form shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the Nara Common Stock into which such shares of Center
Financial Common Stock have been converted as provided in this _Article II_
and the right to receive upon such surrender cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Nara Common Stock, if applicable, as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Nara Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Center Financial Common Stock with respect to the shares
of Nara Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder of unsurrendered Center
Financial Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, until the holder 

 



7  of such Center Financial Common Stock shall have complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_. Subject to the effect of Applicable
Legal Requirements, following the surrender of any such Center Financial
Common Stock, there shall be paid to the holder of whole shares of Nara Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share
of Nara Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_, if applicable, and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole
shares of Nara Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Nara Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All shares of Nara Common Stock
issued upon conversion of shares of Center Financial Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (in each case, including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or _2.2(e)_ ) and all shares of Nara Series B
Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Center Financial Series
A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Center Financial Common Stock or Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock,
respectively; subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Center Financial on
such shares of Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Center Financial Common Stock or Center Financial Series A Preferred
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Center Financial Certificate or letter of
transmittal in respect of shares of Center Financial Common Stock in book
entry form, as applicable, is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, the Center Financial Common Stock represented thereby or referred to
therein shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Nara Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Center Financial Common Stock, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of the Surviving Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the
applicable Center Financial Common Stock by submission of a letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent accompanied, in the case of Center Financial
Common Stock in certificated form, by the applicable Center Financial
Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall pay each holder of such Center
Financial Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Center Financial Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing
price on NASDAQ, as reported on the NASDAQ website at the close of NASDAQs
regular session of trading, for a share of Nara Common Stock on the last
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 



8 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Center Financial for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Center Financial Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Nara Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Nara Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Nara Common Stock.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Nara, Center Financial or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Center
Financial Common Stock or to any holder of shares of Center Financial Series A
Preferred Stock for shares of Nara Common Stock or Nara Series B Preferred
Stock, as applicable, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Nara shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Center Financial Common Stock or to any holder of shares
of Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Nara, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Center
Financial Common Stock or Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Nara.

(i) _Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock_. The Parties shall
contact the holder of the Center Financial Series A Preferred Stock prior to
the Closing Date to make arrangements reasonably acceptable to such holder for
the exchange of such holders shares of such stock after the Effective Time.

 

2.3 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Parties shall have the right to change the method of
effecting the Merger and/or the Bank Merger to an alternative structure
mutually agreed by the Parties, including by re-structuring the transactions
contemplated hereby and under the Bank Merger Agreement to provide for the
merger of Nara with and into Center Financial, with Center Financial being the
surviving corporation, the merger of Nara Bank with and into Center Bank,
with Center Bank being the surviving bank, or both; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any actions taken pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall not (a) alter or
change the kind or amount of consideration to be issued to or retained by
holders of Center Financial Common Stock, Center Financial Series A Preferred
Stock, Nara Common Stock or Nara Series B Preferred Stock, as compared with
what they would otherwise receive or retain pursuant to this Agreement,

and regulations of the SBA thereunder.

 

(d) _SEC Documents; Regulatory Reports; Undisclosed Liabilities_. 

(i) Nara has filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents required under Applicable Legal Requirements to be filed by it
with the SEC since December 31, 2007 (the " _Nara SEC Documents_ "). Nara has
delivered or made available to Center Financial true, correct and complete
copies of all Nara SEC Documents, all comment letters received by Nara from
the SEC since December 31, 2007, all responses to such comment letters by or
on behalf of Nara and all other correspondence since December 31, 2007
between the SEC and Nara, in each case to the extent not available to the
public in completely unredacted form on EDGAR. No Subsidiary of Nara is, or
since December 31, 2007 has been, required to file any form,
report, registration statement or other document with the SEC. As of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such filing), the Nara SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the SOX Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Nara SEC
Documents, and none of the Nara SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) of Nara included in
the Nara SEC Documents complied, as of their respective dates of

 



30  filing with the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Nara and
its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations,
changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of such companies as of the
dates and for the periods shown, subject, in the case of interim financial
statements, to (i) the omission of notes to the extent permitted by
Regulations S-X of the SEC (but only if, in the case of interim financial
statements included in Nara SEC Documents since Naras most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K, such notes would not differ materially from the notes to
the financial statements included in such Annual Report) and (ii) normal,
recurring year-end adjustments (but only if the effect of such adjustments
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material). No financial
statements of any Person other than the Subsidiaries of Nara are, or, since
December 31, 2007 have been, required by generally accepted accounting
principles to be included in the consolidated financial statements of Nara.

(ii) Since December 31, 2007, Nara and each of its Subsidiaries have
timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were required to be
filed by them under any Applicable Legal Requirements with the Federal
Reserve, the FDIC, the DFI and with any other applicable Governmental Entity,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except to the extent that the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Nara. As of their respective dates (and without giving
effect to any amendments or modifications filed after the date of this
Agreement with respect to reports and documents filed before the date of this
Agreement), each of such reports, registrations and statements (including the
financial statements, exhibits and schedules therein) complied in all
material respects with the applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders
enforced or promulgated by the Governmental Entity with which they were filed.

 

(iii) Except for (A) those liabilities that are fully reflected or
reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of Nara included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010,
as filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) liabilities
incurred since September 30, 2010 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and (C) liabilities which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Nara, Nara and its Subsidiaries do not have, and
since September 30, 2010 Nara and its Subsidiaries have not incurred (except
to the extent permitted by _Section 4.2_), any liabilities or obligations of
any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and
whether or not required to be reflected in Naras financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).

 



31 (iv) Nara is, and since December 31, 2007 has been, in compliance with

filed, furnished, transmitted or otherwise made available to the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity.

 

(e) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Nara for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held
in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by Nara with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Center Financial for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4.

 

(f) _Compliance with Applicable Legal and Reporting Requirements_. 

(i) Nara and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, authorizations,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities which are material to the operation of the businesses of Nara and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the " _Nara Permits_ "), the Nara Permits are
in full force and effect and Nara and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms of the Nara Permits, except where the failure so to hold, be in full
force and effect or comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara.

 

(ii) Since December 31, 2007, Nara and each of its Subsidiaries has
conducted its business in compliance with all Applicable Legal Requirements
(including the SOX Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, any other applicable

discrimination-related statutes, rules or regulations) or to the employees
conducting such businesses, except for possible

 



32  violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara. To the knowledge of Nara,
no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to Nara or any of
its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in each case, those the
outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara. 

(g) _Accounting and Internal Controls_.

 

(i) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Nara and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Nara or its Subsidiaries (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following clause.

 

(ii) Nara and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to

Act), and such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that (1) all
information required to be disclosed by Nara in the reports it files under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Naras management, including
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (B) disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Naras auditors and
the audit committee of the Nara Board (1) any significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any
material respect Naras ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for Naras auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material,
that

internal controls. Nara has made available to Center Financial a summary of
any such disclosure made by management to Naras auditors and audit committee
since December 31, 2007.

(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Nara or any of its Subsidiaries or their internal control over
financial reporting, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Nara or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices.

 

(h) _Legal Proceedings_. There is no suit, action, investigation
or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending
or, to the knowledge of Nara, threatened, against or affecting Nara or any
Subsidiary of Nara as to which there is a significant possibility of
an adverse outcome which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against Nara or any Subsidiary of Nara having, or
which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Nara or on the Surviving Corporation.

(i) Each of Nara and the Nara Subsidiaries has timely filed, or has
caused to be timely filed on its behalf (taking into account any extension of

settled examinations or any concluded litigation have been fully paid.

 



34 (iv) Neither Nara nor any Nara Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code within the two-year period
ending on the Closing Date.

(v) Neither Nara nor any Nara Subsidiary has any liability for any tax
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of any

similar provision of any other tax law.

 

(vi) Neither Nara nor any Nara Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take

Code.

permit any Center Financial Subsidiary or any Nara Subsidiary to dispose of
or discontinue any Center Financial Subsidiarys significant historic
business assets or to substantially alter any Center Financial Subsidiarys
significant historic business lines. The Parties agree that any bulk sales
after the Merger of certain non-performing loans previously owned by Center
Financial, representing not more than 20% of Center Financials loan portfolio
immediately before the Merger, are not inconsistent with the representation in
the preceding sentence. 

(j) _Certain Agreements_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(j)_
of the Nara Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement, neither Nara
nor any of its Subsidiaries

 



35  is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (i) with respect to the employment of any directors or executive
officers, or with any consultants that are natural persons, involving the
payment of $150,000 or more per annum, (ii) which is a "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii)
which limits the ability of Nara or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any
line of business, in any geographic area or with any Person, or which requires
referrals of business or requires Nara or any of its affiliates to make
available investment opportunities to any Person on a priority, equal or

reasonably be expected to be material to Nara and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, (iv) with or to a labor union or other collective
bargaining representative (including any collective bargaining agreement),
(v) in the case of a Nara Benefit Plan, any of the benefits of which will be

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) which would prohibit
or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (vii) which involve the payment of more than $250,000 and are not
terminable without penalty on notice of 90 days or less, (viii) real property

the ordinary course of business. Nara has previously made available to Center

commitment or understanding of the type described in this _Section 3.2(j)_
(collectively referred to herein as the " _Nara Contracts_ "). All of the Nara
Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except to the extent they
have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure to be
in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara. Neither Nara
nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the best knowledge of Nara, none of
the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or committed or
failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists, which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the
provisions of, any Nara Contract, except in each case for those violations and
defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Nara.

(k) _Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) With respect to each Benefit Plan under which any employee or
former employee of Nara or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future
right to benefits, and which is maintained or contributed to by Nara or any of

the Code.

 

(ii) None of the Nara Benefit Plans are subject to Title IV of ERISA.

ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state law.

 

(iv) Each Nara Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation

2005 through the date hereof.

 

(v) With respect to the Nara Benefit Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Nara, there exists
no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Nara or any of

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Nara under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(vi) True and complete copies of the Nara Stock Plans as in effect
on the date hereof, and copies of all outstanding awards agreements relating
thereto, have been provided or made available to Center Financial.

(vii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(k)(vii)_ of the Nara
Disclosure Schedule, no Nara Benefit Plan or Nara Stock Plan exists that could
result in the payment to any present or former employee of Nara or any
Subsidiary of Nara of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any
other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of Nara or any
Subsidiary of Nara as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(viii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(k)(viii)_ of the
Nara Disclosure Schedule, none of the assets of any Nara Benefit Plan are
invested in employer securities or employer real property.

(ix) With respect to each of the Nara Benefit Plans, all contributions or
premium payments due and payable on or before the Closing Date have been
timely made, and, to the extent not presently payable, appropriate reserves
have been established for the payment and properly accrued in accordance with
customary accounting practices.

similar undertaking to, or is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order
or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter
from, or has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the
request of, any Governmental Entity which restricts materially the conduct of
its business, imposes any material requirements or procedures or in any manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies or its
management, nor has Nara been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of
issuing or requesting) any such agreement, decree, memorandum of
understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, order,
directive or similar submission, or any such policy, procedure or board
resolutions. Nara and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all of the
foregoing so listed in _Section 3.2(m)_ of the Nara Disclosure Schedule,
except to the extent that the failure so to comply would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Nara. There are no formal or informal investigations, known to Nara, relating
to any regulatory matters pending before any Governmental Entity with respect
to Nara or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(n) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From September 30,
2010 through the date of this Agreement: (i) Nara and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
their past practices, (ii) there has not been any change, circumstance or
event (including any event involving a prospective change) which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Nara and (iii) there has not been (A) any action or event
of the type that would have required the consent of Center Financial under
_Section 4.2_ or (B) any material loss, damage or destruction to, or any
material interruption in the use of, any of the assets of Nara or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by insurance).

 

(o) _Board Approval_. The Nara Board, by resolutions duly adopted
by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly called and held (the "

Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Nara and its stockholders and
declared the Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Merger, and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Nara adopt this
Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration
by Nara stockholders at the Nara Stockholders Meeting. No state takeover
statute is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



38 (p) _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Nara Common Stock to adopt this
Agreement (the " _Required Nara Vote_ ") is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of Nara capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

(q) _Properties_. Nara or one of its Subsidiaries (i) has good and
marketable title to all the properties and assets reflected in the latest
audited balance sheet included in the Nara SEC Documents filed prior to the
date hereof as being owned by Nara or one of its Subsidiaries or acquired
after the date thereof which are material to Naras business on
a consolidated basis (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since
the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all
claims, liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and (ii) is the lessee of all
leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements
included in such Nara SEC Documents or acquired after the date thereof which
are material to its business on a consolidated basis (except for leases that

the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid
without default thereunder by the lessee or, to Naras knowledge, the lessor,

Adverse Effect on Nara.

 

(r) _Intellectual Property_. Nara and its Subsidiaries own or have
a valid license to use all trademarks, service marks and trade names
(including any registrations or applications for registration of any of the
foregoing) (collectively, the " _Nara Intellectual Property_ ") necessary to
carry on their business substantially as currently conducted, except where
such failures to own or validly license such Nara Intellectual Property would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Nara. Neither Nara nor any such Subsidiary has
received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and to Naras
knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts with, the rights of
others with respect to the use of any Nara Intellectual Property which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Nara.

(s) _Derivatives_. All Derivative Contracts, whether entered into
for Naras own account, or for the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries
or their respective customers, were entered into (i) in accordance with
prudent business practices and all Applicable Legal Requirements and (ii) with
counterparties which Nara believes to be financially responsible. Each
Derivative Contract of Nara or any of its Subsidiaries constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of Nara or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, that is enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equitable principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither Nara nor its
Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of Nara any other party thereto, is in
breach of any of its obligations under any Derivative Contract of Nara or one
of its Subsidiaries. The financial position of Nara and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis under or with respect to each such Derivative Contract has
been reflected in the books and records of Nara

 



39  and such Subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

 

(t) _Loan Portfolio_.

 

(i) Neither Nara nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any written

the foregoing. Set forth in _Section 3.2(t)_ of the Nara Disclosure Schedule

Loans of Nara and its Subsidiaries that, as of September 30, 2010, were
classified as such, together with the aggregate principal amount of and

include any Loans so classified by Nara or by any Governmental Entity. Nara
shall provide to Center Financial, on a monthly basis, (1) a schedule of Loans
of Nara and its Subsidiaries that become classified in the manner described in
the previous sentence, or any Loan of Nara and its Subsidiaries the
classification of which is changed to a lower classification or to OREO, and
(2) a schedule of Loans of Nara and its Subsidiaries in which the obligor is
delinquent in payment by 30 days or more, in each case after the date of this
Agreement.

 

(ii) Each Loan of Nara and its Subsidiaries (A) is evidenced by notes,

Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by
the SEC as promptly as is reasonably practicable and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Nara and Center Financial shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with
copies of any written comments and advise the other Party of any oral
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate and provide the other Party
with a reasonable opportunity to 

 



50  review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and
each Party will provide the other Party with a copy of all such filings made
with the SEC. Nara shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the Merger and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it
and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Nara will advise Center Financial, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Nara Common Stock and Nara Series B Preferred Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to either of the Parties, or their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either Party
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Center Financial and Nara.

 

(b) Center Financial shall duly take all lawful action to call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the
" _Center Financial Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Required Center Financial Vote. The Center Financial Board shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Center Financial stockholders the
Required Center Financial Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
covenant shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Center Financial Board
to make a Change in Recommendation in compliance with _Section 5.1(f)_.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Center
Financial of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for
a vote on the approval of the principal terms of the Merger. Subject to
_Section 5.1(f)_, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
recommendation of the Center Financial Board that the stockholders of Center
Financial vote to approve the principal terms of the Merger (such
recommendation being referred to herein as the " _Center Financial Board
Recommendation_ ").

 

(c) Nara shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the " _Nara
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Nara Vote.
The Nara Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Nara
stockholders the Required Nara Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Nara Board to
make a Change in Recommendation in compliance with _Section 5.1(f)_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Nara of its obligation
to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the adoption
thereof. Subject to  _Section 5.1(f)_, the Joint Proxy

 



51  Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation of the Nara Board that
the stockholders of Nara vote to approve and adopt this Agreement (such
recommendation being referred to herein as the " _Nara Board Recommendation_
" and, together with the Center Financial Board Recommendation, the " _Board
Recommendations_ ").

(d) Center Financial and Nara shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Center Financial Stockholders Meeting and the Nara
Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same date.

(e) Subject to  _Section 5.1(f)_, neither the Center Financial Board
or the Nara Board nor any committee of either thereof shall: (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify its Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the other
Party, or adopt or propose a resolution to withdraw, modify or qualify its
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the other Party or take any other
action that is or becomes disclosed publicly and which can reasonably be
interpreted as indicating that such board of directors or any committee
thereof does not support the Merger and this Agreement or does not believe
that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests of its
stockholders; (ii) fail to reaffirm, without qualification, its
Board Recommendation or fail to state publicly, without qualification, that
the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests of its stockholders
within five business days after the other Party requests in writing that such
action be taken; (iii) fail to announce publicly within ten business days
after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Center Financial Common
Stock (in the case of the Center Financial Board) or the Nara Common Stock (in
the case of the Nara Board), shall have been commenced, that it recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (iv) fail to issue within 10
business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced with respect
to Center Financial (in the case of the Center Financial Board) or Nara (in
the case of the Nara Board) a press release announcing its opposition to such
Acquisition Proposal; (v) approve, endorse or recommend any such Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Center Financial (in the case of the Center
Financial Board) or Nara (in the case of the Nara Board) or (vi) resolve or
propose to take any action described in _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_ of this
sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in  _clauses (i)_ through
_(vi)_ of this sentence being referred to herein as a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ").

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Sections
5.1(b)_ , _5.1(c)_ or _5.1(e)_ , at any time prior to the approval of
the principal terms of the Merger by the Required Center Financial Vote (in
the case of Center Financial) or at any time prior to the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Nara Vote (in the case of Nara),
the Center Financial Board or the Nara Board, as the case may be, may effect,
or cause Center Financial or Nara, respectively, to effect a Change in
Recommendation:

(i) if: (A) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer to effect a transaction of the type referred to in the
definition of the term Superior Proposal is made to Center Financial or Nara
(such Party under such circumstances being referred to herein as a " _Target
Party_ ") and is not withdrawn; (B) such unsolicited, bona fide, written offer
was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a breach of, or
any action inconsistent with, this Agreement; (C) the Target Party has
materially complied with its obligations to provide notices to the other Party
of any Acquisition Proposal and other matters requiring notice under _Section
5.4(b)(ii)_; (D) at

 



52  least five business days prior to each meeting of the board of directors of
a Target Party, at which such board of directors will consider and determine
whether any such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Target Party
provides the other Party with a written notice specifying the date and time of
such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions
of the offer that is the basis of the potential action by the board of
directors of the Target Party (including a copy of any draft definitive
agreement reflecting the offer) and the identity of the Person making the
offer (it being agreed that any change to the terms and conditions of such
offer shall require a new notice and five business day period); (E) such
board of directors determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into
account the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and its outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (F) such board of directors does not effect, or cause the Target
Party to effect, a Change in Recommendation at any time within five business
days after the other Party receives written notice from the Target Party
confirming that such board of directors has determined that such offer is a
Superior Proposal and intends to effect a Change in Recommendation; (G) during
such five business day period, if requested by such other Party, the Target
Party engages in good faith negotiations with such other Party to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal; (H) at the end
of such five business day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party as a result of the
negotiations required by _clause (G)_ or otherwise); and (I) the board of
directors of the Target Party reasonably determines in good faith, after
obtaining and taking into account the advice of its outside legal counsel
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, a Change in Recommendation is
required in order for such board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties to its stockholders under the Applicable Legal Requirements; or

 

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances occurs
(that is not an Acquisition Proposal) or arises after the date of this
Agreement that was neither known to Center Financial or Nara or any of their
respective executive officers, directors, advisors and representatives
nor reasonably foreseeable by Center Financial or Nara or any of their
respective executive officers, directors, advisors and representatives as of
the date of this Agreement (such material development or change in such
circumstances being referred to herein as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (B) at
least five business days prior to each meeting of the Center Financial Board
or the Nara Board at which such board of directors intends to consider whether
such Intervening Event requires such board of directors to effect or cause
Center Financial (in the case of the Center Financial Board) or Nara (in the
case of the Nara Board) to effect, a Change in Recommendation, the Party whose
board of directors is to meet for such purpose provides the other Party with
a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons
for holding such meeting, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the
Intervening Event (it being agreed that any material change in such
Intervening Event shall require a new notice and five business day period);
(C) during such five business day period, if requested by the Party so
notified, the Party whose board of directors is to meet for such purpose
engages in good faith negotiations with the Party so notified to amend this
Agreement in a manner that obviates the need to effect or cause

 



53  a Change in Recommendation as a result of such Intervening Event; and (D)
the board of directors that is considering whether to effect a Change in
Recommendation reasonably determines in good faith, after obtaining and
taking into account the advice of outside legal counsel, that, in light of
such Intervening Event, a Change in Recommendation is required in order for
such board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to
its stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements.

 

5.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, Center Financial and Nara shall each
(and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the
representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts
and records and, during such period, each of Center Financial and Nara shall
(and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) make available to
the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws, federal or state banking
laws or the rules and regulations of self regulatory organizations (other than
reports or documents which such Party is not permitted to disclose under
Applicable Legal Requirements) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request.
Neither Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties will
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) The Parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the letter dated as of October 8, 2010, among Center Financial Bank, Center
Financial, Nara Bank and Nara (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

(c) No such investigation by either Nara or Center Financial shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other.

 

5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of Center Financial and Nara shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all Applicable Legal
Requirements which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and/or any other public or private third party which is
required to be obtained or made by such

 



54  Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Applicable Legal Requirements
or any contract or other obligation in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a
Party shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the foregoing if
the taking of such action or such compliance or the obtaining of such consent,
authorization, order, approval or exemption will result in a condition or
restriction on such Party or on the Surviving Corporation having an effect of
the type referred to in _Section 6.1(f)_. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the Parties obligations under this  _Section 5.3_, each of
the Parties further agrees as follows:

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, each of Center
Financial and Nara shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all
reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation and effect all
necessary filings in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

 

(ii) The Parties will cooperate with each other and will each furnish
the other and the others counsel with all information concerning themselves,
their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with any
application, petition or any other statement or application made by or on
behalf of any Party or its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger. Center Financial and Nara shall have the right to
review in advance all filings made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Entity (other than with
regard to information reasonably considered confidential by the providing
Party). In addition, Center Financial and Nara shall each furnish to the
other a final copy of each such filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Entity
(other than any part of such filings reasonably considered confidential by the
providing Party). 

(iii) Subject to Applicable Legal Requirements, Center Financial and
Nara shall permit each other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or
material oral communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) between it
and any Governmental Entity (except for any confidential portions thereof).

(iv) Center Financial and Nara shall promptly inform each other of and
supply to each other any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda)
received by them from, or given by them to, any Governmental Entity, in each
case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(v) Center Financial and Nara shall ensure that representatives of
Center Financial and Nara shall have the right to attend and participate in
any hearing, proceeding, meeting, conference or similar event before or with
any Governmental Entity or other organization relating to any Requisite
Regulatory Approval or otherwise relating to any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as may otherwise be required by such Governmental
Entity. In furtherance of the foregoing, Center Financial and Nara shall
provide each other reasonable advance notice of any such hearing, proceeding,
meeting, conference or similar event.

 



55 (b) Nara agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the
Effective Time, supplemental indentures and other instruments required for the
due assumption of Center Financials outstanding debt, guarantees and other
securities to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees and
securities and the instruments and agreements relating thereto, including
under the Indenture dated as of December 30, 2003 between Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee, and Center Financial, relating to the
issuance by Center Financial of its Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due
January 7, 2034.

 

(c) Each of Center Financial and Nara and their respective boards
of directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Each of Nara and Center Financial agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage
or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Subsidiaries or
any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including
stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting
securities that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or
the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning securities representing
20% or more of the total voting power of it (or of the surviving parent entity
in such transaction) or of any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer
or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other Party or an
affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential
information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

(b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of
each Party shall be permitted, prior to its respective meeting of stockholders
to be held pursuant to _Section 5.1_, and subject to material compliance by
such Party with the other terms of this _Section 5.4_ and to such Party
first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the Person making the

 



56  Acquisition Proposal described below having provisions that are no less
favorable to such Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic
information or data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal by such Person first made after the date of this
Agreement which such Partys board of directors concludes in good faith
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

 

(ii) Each Party shall notify the other Party promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its Subsidiaries by
any Person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that it
is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry
from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such Party
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally
and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if
in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Each Party shall
also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other Party,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data
to any Person in accordance with this _Section 5.4(b)_ (and shall promptly
provide to the other Party copies of all material nonpublic information so
provided not previously provided to the other Party) and shall keep the other
Party promptly and fully informed of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including
by providing within 24 hours of receipt a copy of all material documentation
or correspondence relating thereto (including copies of all changes in any
terms).

 

(iii) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit either
Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules shall
not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to
such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section
7.1(d)_ or _7.1(e)_ , as applicable.

 

(c) Each of Nara and Center Financial agrees that (i) it will and will
cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents,
representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and will
promptly request each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with such Party in connection with the consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal, to return or destroy all confidential
information or data heretofore furnished to such Person, (ii) it shall enforce
(and not release any third party from or waive) any provisions of, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
(iii) it will not take any action to render inapplicable or to exempt any
Person from Section 203 of the DGCL or any other antitakeover legislation.
Each of Nara and Center Financial agrees that it will use reasonable best
efforts to inform its and its Subsidiaries

 



57  respective directors, executive officers, key employees, agents and
representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 5.4_.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall (i) permit either Party to
terminate this Agreement or (ii) affect any other obligation of the Parties
under this Agreement. Neither Party shall submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

 

(e) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) made pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)(iii)_ shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation by Center Financial or Nara, as the case may be, unless
the board of directors of the Party making such disclosure expressly
reaffirms its Board Recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger or the adoption of this
Agreement, as applicable.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ shall be deemed, as between
the Parties, to apply to each Party, its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries directors and employees, agents and representatives to the same
extent as such provisions apply to the respective Parties, and each Party
shall be responsible for any breach of such provisions by any of its or its
Subsidiaries directors, employees, agents or representatives.

5.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Nara shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause the shares of Nara Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Closing Date.

 

5.6 _Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Nara and Center Financial agree that, except as otherwise
provided herein (including as set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Center
Financial Disclosure Schedule) and unless otherwise mutually determined, the
Nara Benefit Plans and Center Financial Benefit Plans in effect at the date of
this Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective Time with respect
to employees covered by such plans at the Effective Time, and the Surviving
Corporation shall as promptly as practical formulate Benefit Plans for the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with respect both to employees
who were covered by the Nara Benefit Plans and Center Financial Benefit Plans
at the Effective Time and employees who were not covered by such plans at the
Effective Time, that provide benefits for services on a basis that does not
discriminate between employees who were covered by the Nara Benefit Plans and
employees who were covered by the Center Financial Benefit Plans. Center
Financial shall adopt such amendments to the Center Financial Benefit Plans
as requested by Nara to implement the foregoing and to avoid the duplication
of benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if
requested by Nara, Center Financial shall terminate the Center Financial
Severance Program (Revised August 12, 2009) and any other plans, policies,
programs or arrangements providing severance benefits, such termination to be
effective prior to the Effective Date.

 

(b) Center Financial and Nara further agree that, to the extent
that employees of Center Financial and its Subsidiaries or Nara and its
Subsidiaries are covered by Benefit Plans of the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Corporation shall: (i) provide employees of Center 

 



58  Financial and its Subsidiaries and employees of Nara and its Subsidiaries
credit for all years of service with Center Financial or any of its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors, or Nara and any of its Subsidiaries and
their predecessors, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time for the purpose
of eligibility and vesting, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing
condition under comparable Benefit Plans applicable to the individual
immediately prior to the Closing Date) and eligibility waiting periods under
group health plans of the Surviving Corporation to be waived with respect to
employees of Center Financial and its Subsidiaries and Nara and its
Subsidiaries who remain as employees of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) and (iii) cause to be credited,
for purposes of the Surviving Corporations health plans, any deductibles or
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees of Center Financial and its
Subsidiaries and Nara and its Subsidiaries and their beneficiaries and
dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to their
participation in the Surviving Corporations health plans with the objective
that there be no double counting during the year in which the Closing Date
occurs of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, to the extent that the Surviving Corporation
reasonably determines that legal, administrative, or other impediments make
compliance with the preceding sentence not reasonably practicable or that such
compliance would result in the duplication of benefits, the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligations or liabilities with respect to the
requirements of the preceding sentence. Center Financial and Nara hereby
further agree that, except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the
Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with
their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual
rights of, current and former employees of Center Financial and its
Subsidiaries and Nara and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Nara shall recognize and honor all unused sick leave and
unused vacation accrued by the employees of Center Financial and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time notwithstanding any limitations on sick
leave accruals or carry-overs or vacation accruals applicable under Naras
sick leave or vacation accrual policies.

 

5.7 _Center Financial Stock Option and Center Financial
Restricted Shares_.

(a) Center Financial shall deliver to Nara the Section 16 Information
reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, and the Nara Board, or a
committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a
resolution providing that the receipt by the Center Financial Insiders of Nara
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Center Financial Common Stock
(including Center Financial Restricted Shares), and of options to purchase
Nara Common Stock upon conversion of Center Financial Stock Options, in each
case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such
securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by Center
Financial to Nara prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such
receipt shall be so exempt.

 

(b) Nara agrees to file with the SEC, no later than 30 days after
the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form) relating to the Nara Common Stock issuable with respect to the Assumed
Options and the Assumed Restricted Shares and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the 

 



59  effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any
of Assumed Option or Assumed Restricted Shares remain outstanding.

 

5.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expense, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_ hereof and except
that (a) if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or
cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on either
Party in connection with the Merger, and (b) the filing fees and printing
and mailing expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally
by Nara and Center Financial.

 

5.9 _Governance; Name Change_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Nara shall use its reasonable
best efforts to adopt the amendment to the By-laws of Nara substantially in
the form set forth in _Exhibit 1.4_ and to effect the requirements and adopt
the resolutions referenced therein. On or prior to the Effective Time, Nara
shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the board of directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be 14. Of the members of
the initial board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective
Time, seven shall be current members of the Nara Board as designated by Nara
prior the Effective Time, and seven shall be current members of the Center
Financial Board as designated by Center Financial prior to the Effective Time.
No other directors or employees of Nara or Center Financial shall be
designated to serve on the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at
the Effective Time. Subject to and in accordance with the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation (as amended substantially in the form set forth in 
_Exhibit 1.4_ ), effective as of the Effective Time, (i) Mr. Ki Suh Park shall
serve as the Chairman of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation,
(ii) Mr. Chang Hwi Kim shall serve as the Vice Chairman of the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation and (iii) Mr. Alvin D. Kang shall serve

(b) Nara shall, and shall cause Nara Bank to, take all actions
necessary, including by adopting, and causing Nara Bank to adopt, an amendment
to the Certificate of Incorporation of Nara and Nara Bank, respectively, to
provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, each of the names of the
Surviving Corporation and Nara Bank shall be changed to a name mutually

5.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of
Center Financial or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit,

 



60  proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of Center Financial or any Subsidiary of Center Financial, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (" _Indemnified
Liabilities_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
Center Financial pursuant to Center Financials Articles of Incorporation, By-
laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof
with any directors, officers and employees of Center Financial and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Center
Financial ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the
premiums paid as of the date hereof by Center Financial for such insurance ("
_Center Financial s Current Premium_"), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 250% of Center Financials Current Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of
Center Financials Current Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, Center
Financial, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Nara, may obtain
on or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy or "extended
discovery period" under Center Financials existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that does not exceed Center Financials Current Premium.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an
Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this _Section 5.10_.

 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.10_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section 5.10_ (i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and representatives and (ii)

 



61  are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

5.11 _Public Announcements_. Nara and Center Financial shall use
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
Applicable Legal Requirements or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other
before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent
disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.1_ or as otherwise permitted
under _Section 4.4_, no Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement or disclosure concerning the other Party or the other
Partys business, financial condition or results of operations without the
consent of such other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Each Party shall provide the other Party with its stockholder
lists and allow and facilitate the other Partys contact with its stockholders
and prospective investors and following a Change in Recommendation by Center
Financial or Nara, as the case may be, such contacts may be made without
regard to the above limitations of this _Section 5.11_.

 

5.12 _Tax Matters_. (a) Center Financial and Nara each shall not,
and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken
any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, which would reasonably
be expected to disqualify the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) Center Financial and Nara each agree to
file all tax returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

5.13 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises

of each Party shall take all such necessary action.

_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.10_ shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 8.10_ shall not constitute
a

 



76  general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall
have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section 8.10_. The
Parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

AMENDMENT TO NARA BYLAWS

The bylaws of Nara shall be amended at or prior to the Effective Time to
include, as of the Effective Time, the following new Article II, Section 9:

 

Section 9. Integration Period

9.1 The Board of Directors has resolved that the governance and other
provisions set forth in this Article II, Section 9 shall apply and be
effective during the period beginning at the Effective Time (as defined in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 9, 2010, by and between
the Corporation and Center Financial Corporation ("Center Financial"), as may
be amended from time to time (the "Merger Agreement")), and ending on a date
not to be later than the second anniversary of the Effective Time or such
earlier date, but not prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, as
may be determined by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board
of Directors (the "Integration Period"). Terms defined in the Merger Agreement
are used in this Article II, Section 9 as so defined.

 

9.2 The Board of Directors shall consist of 14 members. Effective as of
the Effective Time, seven members of the Board of Directors shall be current
members of the Board of Directors designated by the Corporation prior to the
Effective Time, including each of the persons designated for specified board
of director or officer positions with the Corporation or Nara Bank in this
Article II, Section 9 (such seven persons and their replacements, if any, as
determined in accordance with Article II, Section 9.5 being referred to in
this Article II, Section 9 as the "Continuing Nara Directors"), and seven
members of the Board of Directors shall be current members of the board of
directors of Center Financial designated by Center Financial prior to the
Effective Time, including each of the persons designated for board
of director positions with the Corporation or Nara Bank in this Article II,
Section 9 (such seven persons and their replacements, if any, as determined in
accordance with Article II, Section 9.5 being referred to in this Article II,
Section 9 as the "Continuing Center Financial Directors"), in each case,
subject to such designee satisfying the eligibility criteria to serve as a
Director of the Corporation as set forth in the Nomination and Governance
Committee Charter of the Corporation (the "Eligibility Criteria") as of the
Effective Time.

 

9.3 Effective as of the Effective Time, Mr. Ki Suh Park shall serve as
Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mr. Chang Hwi Kim shall serve as Vice
Chairman of the Board of Directors. In the event that Mr. Ki Suh Park ceases
to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors for any reason during the
Integration Period, his successor as Chairman of the Board of Directors shall
be selected by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Continuing
Nara Directors. In the event that Mr. Chang Hwi Kim ceases to serve as Vice
Chairman of the Board of Directors for any reason during the Integration
Period, his successor as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be
selected by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Continuing
Center Financial Directors. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that
Mr. Ki Suh Park or Mr. Chang Hwi Kim ceases to serve as a Director of the
Corporation for any reason during the Integration Period, their respective

with Article II, Section 9.5. 9.4 Effective as of the Effective Time, Mr. Kevin S. Kim shall serve
as Chairman of the board of directors of Nara Bank and Mr. Scott Whang shall

Chairman of the board of directors of Nara Bank shall be selected by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Continuing Center
Financial Directors. In the event that Mr. Scott Whang ceases to serve as
Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Nara Bank for any reason during the
Integration Period, his successor as Vice Chairman of the board of directors
of Nara Bank shall be selected by the affirmative vote of at least a majority
of the Continuing Nara Directors. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that Mr. Kevin S. Kim or Mr. Scott Whang ceases to serve as a Director of the
Corporation for any reason during the Integration Period, their respective
successors as Directors of the Corporation shall be determined in accordance
with Article II, Section 9.5.

9.5 All vacancies on the Board of Directors, and any Committees
thereof, created through the cessation of service for any reason of (i) any
Continuing Nara Director shall be filled by a nominee proposed to the
Nomination and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (together with
any successor Committee thereto, the "Nomination and Governance Committee") by
a majority of the remaining Continuing Nara Directors and approved by the
Board of Directors or (ii) any Continuing Center Financial Director shall be
filled by a nominee proposed to the Nomination and Governance Committee by a
majority of the remaining Continuing Center Financial Directors and approved
by the Board of Directors. If the Nomination and Governance Committee does not
appoint any such proposed nominee, or if the Board of Directors does not
approve any such nominee proposed by the Nomination and Governance Committee,
a majority of the remaining Continuing Nara Directors or a majority of the
remaining Continuing Center Financial Directors, as applicable, shall propose
a substitute nominee to the Nomination and Governance Committee. This process
shall be repeated if necessary until the applicable vacancy has been filled.
All Directors of the Corporation so nominated and appointed or elected
pursuant to this Article II, Section 9.5 shall be considered "Continuing
Nara Directors" or "Continuing Center Financial Directors," as the case may
be, for purposes of this Article II, Section 9.

9.6 The Nomination and Governance Committee shall recommend to the
Board of Directors that each Continuing Nara Director and each Continuing
Center Financial Director be nominated, and the Board of Directors shall
nominate each Continuing Nara Director and each Continuing Center Financial
Director so recommended, for election at each annual meeting of stockholders
that is held during the Integration Period, in each case, so long as such
Continuing Nara Director or Continuing Center Financial Director, as the case
may be, continues to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at such time. In the
event that any Continuing Center Financial Director or Continuing Nara
Director no longer satisfies the Eligibility Criteria at such time, a
replacement nominee shall be selected in accordance with Article II, Section
9.5.

9.7 Effective as of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors shall
establish a Consolidation Committee of the Board of Directors (together with

development of integration policies and procedures and overseeing managements
efforts in the integration of the Corporation and Center Financial during the
Integration Period and shall have such additional responsibilities, if any, as
may be further  delegated to it by the Board of Directors. The Consolidation Committee shall
consist of a total of four members, of which two shall be Continuing Nara
Directors selected by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
Continuing Nara Directors, and two shall be Continuing Center Financial
Directors selected by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
Continuing Center Financial Directors, and none of whom shall be employees of
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

9.8 Subject to any independence and expertise requirements under
Applicable Legal Requirements, during the Integration Period: (i) all

least a majority of the total number of Directors of the Corporation
authorized by this Article II, Section 9; provided that any Director of the
Corporation who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
shall be recused from voting on any such matter that may only be decided by
independent directors under Applicable Legal Requirements.

 

9.9 Effective as of the Effective Time, Mr. Alvin D. Kang shall serve
as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. The removal of Mr. Kang from
the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation during the 18-month
period commencing as of the Effective Time, including any reduction of his
authority not consistent with being a chief executive officer, or the failure
to appoint or re-elect Mr. Kang to the position of Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation during such 18-month period, to which action Mr. Kang does not
consent, shall each require the affirmative vote of at least 66 percent of
the total number of Directors of the Corporation authorized by this Article
II, Section 9. Any amendment to or termination of any employment agreement Mr.
Kang may have with the Corporation to which Mr. Kang does not consent during
such 18-month period shall require the affirmative vote of at least a majority
of the total number of Directors of the Corporation authorized by this Article
II, Section 9, including the vote of at least one Continuing Nara Director,
with Mr. Kang abstaining; provided, however, that no such termination during
such 18-month period shall terminate, or be deemed to terminate, Mr. Kangs
status as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. In the event that Mr.
Kang ceases to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for any
reason during such 18-month period, his successor as Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation shall be selected by the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the Continuing Nara Directors. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that Mr. Kang ceases to serve as a Director of the Corporation for any
reason during the Integration Period, his successor as a Director of the
Corporation shall be determined in accordance with Article II, Section 9.5.

9.10 This Article II, Section 9 may be modified, amended or repealed,
and any provision of these Bylaws inconsistent with the provisions of this
Article II, Section 9 may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the total number of Directors of the Corporation authorized by
this Article II, Section 9, including the vote of at least one Continuing
Nara  Director and at least one Continuing Center Financial Director, provided
that any modification, amendment or repeal of the second sentence of Article
II, Section 9.9 shall require the affirmative vote of at least 66 percent of
the total number of Directors of the Corporation authorized by this Article
II, Section 9, with Mr. Kang abstaining with respect to any modification,
amendment or repeal of Article II, Section 9.9. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no provision of this Article II, Section 9.10 shall derogate
from the right of the stockholders to modify, amend or repeal any or all
provisions of this Article II, Section 9 pursuant to Article VII, Section 5 of
these Bylaws. In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this
Article II, Section 9 and any other provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, the provisions of this Article II, Section 9
shall govern and control.

 

9.11 Whenever it is stated in this Article II, Section 9 that a
specified action shall require the affirmative vote of a specified percentage
of the Board of Directors, if the application of such percentage does not
result in a whole number of required votes, the vote required to approve,
adopt or ratify any such action shall be the next highest whole number. _EXHIBIT 1.5_
