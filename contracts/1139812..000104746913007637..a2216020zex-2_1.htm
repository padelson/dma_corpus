Corporation and/or any Subsidiaries and thereafter, the Corporation and Bank shall
indemnify and hold Executive harmless to the maximum extent now or hereafter permitted under the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation or Bank, as applicable. In the event that
legal action is instituted or threatened against the Executive during or after the term of his employment with, or membership on the board of directors of, the Bank, the Corporation or any Subsidiary,
in connection with such employment or membership, the Corporation or Bank will advance to the Executive the costs and expenses incurred by Executive in the defense of such action (including reasonable
attorneys, expert and other professional fees) to the maximum extent permitted by law without prejudice to or waiver by the Corporation or Bank of its rights and remedies against the Executive. In the
event that there is a final judgment entered against the Executive in any such litigation which, in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, is not subject to indemnification, then
the Executive shall reimburse the Corporation or Bank for all such costs and expenses paid or incurred by it in the Executive's defense of such litigation (the "Reimbursement Amount"). The
Reimbursement Amount shall be paid by the Executive within 30&nbsp;days after rendition of the final judgment and a determination by the Board of Directors that such costs and expenses are not
subject to indemnification. The parties shall cooperate in the defense of any asserted claim, demand or liability against the Executive or the Bank, Corporation, Subsidiary or any other affiliates.
The term "final judgment" as used herein shall be defined to mean the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, and in the event of an appeal, then the decision of the appellate court, after
petition for rehearing has been denied, or the time for filing the same (or the filing of further appeal) has expired. The rights to indemnification under this Section&nbsp;11 shall be in addition
to any rights which Executive may now or hereafter have under any insurance contract maintained by the Bank, Corporation, or any Subsidiary or other affiliates or any other agreement between
Executive, Bank, Corporation, Subsidiary or any other affiliates. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Executive's indemnification rights under this Section&nbsp;11, the
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation or Bank and applicable law, shall survive the termination of Executive's employment with the Bank and his membership on the board of directors
of the Bank, Corporation or any Subsidiary. </FONT></P>

of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Code
Section&nbsp;409A and the Bank or Corporation concurs with such belief or the Bank (without any obligation whatsoever to do so) independently makes such determination, the Bank or Corporation shall,
after consulting with the Executive, reform such provision to try to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with
Code Section&nbsp;409A. To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to the maximum
extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to the Executive and the Bank or Corporation of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code

Code Section&nbsp;409A(a)(2)(B) apply, such payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (A)&nbsp;the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the
date of such "separation from service" of the Executive, and (B)&nbsp;the date of the Executive's death (the "Delay Period"). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits
delayed pursuant to this Section&nbsp;20(b) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the
Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Whenever a

actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Bank or Corporation. The Executive's right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Agreement
