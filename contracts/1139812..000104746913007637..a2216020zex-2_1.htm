AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), is dated as of July
14, 2013, by and between MB FINANCIAL, INC., a Maryland corporation (" _MB_
"), and TAYLOR CAPITAL GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _TCG_ ").

  

    
W I T N E S S E T H: 

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of MB and TCG have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to
consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant
to which TCG will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge
with and into MB (the " _Merger_ "), so that MB is the surviving corporation
(in such capacity, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger;

  

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to each party to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of each of TCG and MB have simultaneously herewith entered into a
voting and support Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (each a " _Voting and Support Agreement_ ") in connection with
the Merger; and

  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

  

    1.1 _ The Merger. _ Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ ") and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "),
at the Effective Time, TCG shall merge with and into MB. MB shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Maryland. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of TCG shall terminate.

  

    
 1.2 _ Effective Time. _ The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") and the articles of merger to be filed with the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Department_ "), respectively, on the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificates of Merger. 

  

    
 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger. _ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificates of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and MGCL. 

        

    
 1.4 _ Conversion Generally. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of MB, TCG or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of MB (" _MB Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Subject to _Sections 1.4(d)_, _1.4(e)_ , _1.4(f)_ and _2.4_ , (i) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of TCG (" _TCG Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares, but excluding any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares, and (ii) each share of Nonvoting Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value, of TCG (" _TCG Nonvoting Preferred Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Dissenting Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article II_, into the right to receive (A) a fraction of a share of MB Common Stock equal to 0.64318 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and $4.08 in cash (collectively, the " _Base Merger Consideration_ "), which shall be paid as provided in _Section 2.3_, and (B) the Additional Merger Consideration, if any, as defined in, and payable by MB in accordance with the provisions of,  _Section 2.6_. The Base Merger Consideration and Additional Merger Consideration, if any, is hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_."

 Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by TCG to MB concurrently herewith (the " _TCG Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the TCG Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by TCG that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other section of _Article III_ specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (B) other sections of _Article III_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any TCG Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by TCG since December 31, 2010, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly nonspecific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), TCG hereby represents and warrants to MB that the representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_ are true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, in each case in accordance with the Article III Standard.

TCG has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets as presently owned, operated or leased and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. TCG is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TCG. As used in this 

  

      

  

Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to MB,
TCG or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, (i) a material adverse
effect on the business, properties, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or
market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in
interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally
and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public
disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly
required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent
of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby,

failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections, but not, in either
case, including the underlying causes thereof; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate), (ii) claims,
demands or causes of action by third parties or Governmental Entities,
or fines, penalties or similar assessments by Governmental Entities, pending
or threatened, against a party and/or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, would warrant the reserve by a party under
GAAP, in the case of MB, of an amount in excess of $40.0 million or, in the

attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next

The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each TCG Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of TCG, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any TCG Qualified Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating thereto.

 (ii) make, declare or pay any dividend, or make any other distribution on, its capital stock (except (A) regular quarterly dividends on MB Common Stock not to exceed $0.15 per share, (B) dividends paid by any of the MB Subsidiaries to MB or another wholly-owned MB Subsidiary, or (C) regular distributions on MB\'s outstanding trust preferred securities; 

    

 (b) take any action or knowingly fail to take any action where such action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent either the Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; 

  

 (c) except for the MB Charter Amendment, amend the MB Articles, the MB Bylaws or the comparable organization or governing documents of any MB Subsidiary; 

   

 (d) take any action that is intended or expected to result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect at any 

  

      

  

time prior to the Effective Time, or in any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in _Article VII_ not being satisfied or in a violation of
any provision of this Agreement, except, in every case, as may be required by
applicable law;

  

 (e) take any action that would reasonably be likely to materially delay the effectiveness of the S-4; 

  

 (f) implement or adopt any material change in its accounting principles, practices or methods, other than as may be required by GAAP; or 

  

 (g) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of its board of directors or similar governing body in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this _Section 5.3_. 

  

  

 For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, TCG\'s consent shall be deemed to have been given if MB has made a written request for permission to take any action otherwise prohibited by _Section 5.3_ and has provided TCG with information sufficient for TCG to make an informed decision with respect to such request, and TCG has failed to respond to such request within two (2) business days after TCG\'s receipt of such request. 

  

    
ARTICLE VI 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

    6.1 _ Regulatory Matters_.  

  

  

 (a) MB and TCG shall promptly prepare and use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and MB shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of MB and TCG shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and MB and TCG shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the S-4 is declared effective. MB shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and TCG shall furnish all information concerning TCG and the holders of TCG Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger (collectively the " _Bank Regulatory Applications_ ")), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. MB and TCG shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to TCG or MB, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to 

  

      

  

completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and customary in
connection with transactions similar to those contemplated by this Agreement,
give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require MB or TCG to take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on, or materially and adversely
affect the economic benefits to be realized by, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  

 (c) MB and TCG shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of MB, TCG or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) MB and TCG shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. 

  

  

    
 6.2 _ Access to Information_.  

  

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of MB and TCG, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of MB and TCG shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party, to the extent permissible under applicable law (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws or federal or state banking laws which is generally not available on the SEC\'s EDGAR internet database, and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither MB nor TCG nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of MB\'s or TCG\'s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

      

  

 (b) Each of MB and TCG shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations. 

  

  

    
 6.3 _ Stockholders\' Approvals. _ Each of MB and TCG shall call a meeting of its stockholders (the " _MB Meeting_ " and the " _TCG Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of (a) obtaining the Requisite MB Vote and the Requisite TCG Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, (b) conducting, in the case of the TCG Meeting, a non-binding, advisory stockholder vote with respect to executive compensation as required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act and (c) in the case of the MB Meeting, if so determined by MB, the requisite approval of the stockholders of MB with respect to an amendment to the MB Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of MB Common Stock authorized for grant and the individual award limitations under such plan (the " _MB Stock Plan Amendment_ "), and, if so desired and mutually agreed, to consider such other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of MB and TCG shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of MB and TCG, as the case may be, the Requisite MB Vote, and, if applicable, the requisite approval of the stockholders of MB with respect to the MB Stock Plan Amendment, in the case of MB, and the Requisite TCG Vote, in the case of TCG, including by communicating to its respective stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and/or approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, if the Board of Directors of TCG or MB, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its stockholders, such Board of Directors may submit this Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (x) it gives the other party at least three (3) business days\' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (y) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and will require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.3_. MB or TCG shall adjourn or postpone the MB Meeting or the TCG Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally 

        

scheduled there are insufficient shares of MB Common Stock or TCG Common
Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting TCG or MB, as applicable, has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
TCG Vote or the Requisite MB Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, each of the MB Meeting and TCG Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of each of MB and TCG at the
MB Meeting and the TCG Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the
adoption and/or approval of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either MB or
TCG of such obligation.

  

    
 6.4 _ Legal Conditions to Merger. _ Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_, each of MB and TCG shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by TCG or MB or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 6.5 _ Stock Exchange Listing. _ MB shall cause the shares of common and preferred capital stock of MB to be issued in conjunction with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

    
 6.6 _ Employee and Related Matters_.  

  

  

 (a) Following the Effective Time, MB shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are employees of TCG and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable (and equivalent) to the employee benefits that are made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated employees of MB or its Subsidiaries (other than TCG and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; _provided_ that (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of MB or its Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as MB shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans that are made available to similarly situated employees of MB or its Subsidiaries (other than TCG and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employee\'s continued participation in employee benefit plans of TCG or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the MB Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each MB Benefit Plan). To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a MB Benefit Plan, MB shall cause such MB Benefit Plan to recognize years of prior service from the date of the most recent hire of such Covered Employee with TCG or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under any plan that determines benefits on an actuarial basis, for benefit accrual, but only to the extent that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Closing Date under a comparable TCG Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service. 

  

 (b) MB shall, or shall cause an MB Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Covered Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other 

  

      

  

than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect
to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date
under any welfare plan maintained for the Covered Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid in the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans in which employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date.

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, MB shall, or shall cause a MB Subsidiary to, honor the obligations of TCG and/or Cole Taylor Bank under (i) the Executive Employment Agreement, dated September 4, 2001 with Bruce W. Taylor, and (ii) (A) the TCG Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended and restated effective December 31, 2008 (the " _TCG Senior Officer Plan_ "), including the Consolidated Amendment Agreements with respect to each participant in the TCG Senior Officer Plan, which agreements are substantially similar to the Consolidated Amendment Agreement with Lawrence Ryan dated June 19, 2009, (B) the TCG and Cole Taylor Bank Executive Severance Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2010, and (C) the TCG and Cole Taylor Bank Base Severance Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2010, provided that MB shall maintain, for at least one year following the Effective Time, the TCG and Cole Taylor Bank Executive Severance Plan and the TCG and Cole Taylor Bank Base Severance Plan or plans in lieu thereof providing substantially similar or better benefits to any Covered Employee whose employment is terminated during the one year following the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, MB and Mark A. Hoppe have entered into an employment agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_, (the " _Hoppe New Employment Agreement_ "), which shall become effective at the Effective Time if Mark A. Hoppe is employed by TCG immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Hoppe New Employment Agreement shall replace and supercede the Executive Employment Agreement between TCG, Cole Taylor Bank, and Mark A. Hoppe dated as of January 30, 2008, as amended by a First Amendments to Executive Employment Agreement effective September 2, 2008 and November 21, 2008, respectively (the " _Hoppe Existing Employment Agreement_ "). 

  

 (e) Prior to the Closing Date, TCG shall, and to the extent necessary or appropriate shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all necessary action to freeze the TCG Deferred Compensation Plan as of the Effective Time. Subject to the foregoing, MB shall at the Effective Time assume and honor the obligations of TCG under the TCG Deferred Compensation Plan and the Trust under the TCG Deferred Compensation Plan (the " _Deferred Compensation Trust_ "). 

  

 (f) After the date of this Agreement, neither TCG nor any TCG Subsidiary shall make any payments or incur any obligations under the Management Services Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2013, by and between TCG and Financial Investments Corporation (the " _Management Services Agreement_ ") other than for services actually rendered or as otherwise required pursuant to its terms prior to the Effective Time. TCG shall also cause the Management Services Agreement to be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date without penalty, premium or any other obligation thereunder on the part of TCG or any TCG Subsidiary, except for services actually performed thereunder prior to termination. 

  

 (g) TCG shall have sole and complete discretion to amend any TCG Benefit Plan to the extent necessary to make the bonus, incentive compensation and deferred compensation payments contemplated by _Section 5.2(f)(iv)_ of this Agreement. 

  

 (h) Prior to the Closing Date, TCG shall be permitted, with the prior written approval of MB which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to treat an employee whose employment is terminated not for cause prior to the Effective Time as having been terminated immediately following the Effective Time for purposes of determining the rights and benefits of such employee under the 

  

      

  

TCG Stock Plan and TCG Senior Officer Plan. TCG shall be permitted, to the
extent it deems necessary, to amend the TCG Stock Plan and the TCG Senior
Officer Plan to accomplish the foregoing.

   

 (i) This _Section 6.6_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.6_. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any TCG Benefit Plan or any MB Benefit Plan, (ii) alter or limit the ability of MB or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any of the TCG Benefit Plans or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, (iii) confer upon any current or former employee or other service provider of TCG or its Subsidiaries, any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with MB or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation), or constitute or create an employment or agreement with, or modify the at-will status of any, employee or other service provider, (iv) permit any payment to be made to an employee or service provider of TCG or any TCG Subsidiary that requires prior approval or non-objection from a Regulatory Agency without obtaining such prior approval or non-objection or (v) alter or limit the ability of MB or any of its Subsidiaries to exercise discretion with respect to eligibility, participation, amounts awarded or payable, or benefits provided, under the terms or provisions of any of the MB Benefit Plans. 

  

  

    
 6.7 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance_.  

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of MB and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of TCG and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _TCG Indemnified Parties_ "), and any person who becomes a TCG Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of TCG or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by TCG pursuant to the TCG Certificate, the TCG Bylaws, the organization or governing documents of any Subsidiary of TCG or any other agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement; and MB and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such TCG Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by TCG pursuant to the TCG Certificate, TCG\'s Bylaws, the organization or governing documents of any Subsidiary of TCG or any other agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the TCG Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such TCG Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by TCG ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of 

  

      

  

the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by TCG for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving
Corporation\'s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time. In lieu of the foregoing, MB, or TCG
with the consent of MB, may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy under TCG\'s existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing single limit (not annual) coverage equivalent to
the aggregate coverage described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that does not exceed in the
aggregate 400% (or such higher percentage approved by MB in writing) of the
current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by TCG for such insurance.

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each TCG Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. 

  

  

    
 6.8 _ Additional Agreements. _ In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of MB, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of TCG, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by MB. 

  

    
 6.9 _ Advice of Changes. _ MB and TCG shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event known to it (a) that has had or is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article VII_; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied. 

  

    
 6.10 _ Corporate Governance_.  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of MB shall take all necessary corporate action to cause the TCG Designated Directors to become directors of the Surviving Corporation as provided in _Section 1.9_. 

   

    
 6.11 _ Acquisition Proposals_.  

  

  

 (a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event either party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be 

  

      

  

furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations
or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of such party
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided further_ , that, prior
to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
the foregoing proviso, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party. Each party
will promptly (within seventy-two (72) hours) advise the other party following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof
(including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person
making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the other party
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on
Section 6.11(a) of the TCG Disclosure Schedule, any offer, proposal or inquiry
relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (A) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of more than the Specified
Percentage of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or more
than the Specified Percentage of any class of equity or voting securities of
a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than the Specified Percentage of the consolidated assets of
the party, (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially
owning more than the Specified Percentage of any class of equity or voting
securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than the Specified Percentage of the consolidated
assets of the party, or (C) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than the Specified
Percentage of the consolidated assets of the party. For purposes hereof, "
_Specified Percentage_ " means 24.9% in the case of TCG and 49.9% in the case
of MB.

  

 (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or other applicable disclosure legal requirements or the rules applicable to issuers with securities listed on the NASDAQ with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

  

  

    
 6.12 _ Public Announcements. _ TCG and MB shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

    
 6.13 _ Change of Method_.  TCG and MB shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination of TCG and MB (including the provisions of _Article I_), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided, however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change, in any way, the type or amount of the Merger Consideration, (b) adversely affect the Tax 

        

treatment of TCG\'s stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (c) adversely
affect the Tax treatment of TCG or MB pursuant to this Agreement or (d)
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties agree to reflect any such
change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both
parties in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

  

    
 6.14 _ Takeover Statutes. _ None of TCG, MB or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute. 

  

    
 6.15 _ Trust Preferred Securities. _ Upon the Effective Time, MB shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by TCG under (i) the Indenture dated as of October 21, 2002, between TCG and Bank of America, N.A.

In connection therewith, MB and TCG shall execute and deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents, and the parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof, required to make such assumptions effective. 

  

    
 6.16 _ Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). _ TCG and MB agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain TCG Insiders, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that TCG Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of TCG Common Stock and TCG Nonvoting Preferred Stock into shares of MB Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.16_. Assuming TCG delivers to MB in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of TCG subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _TCG Insiders_ "), the Board of Directors of MB and of TCG, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of TCG Common Stock, TCG Series A Preferred Stock, TCG Series B Preferred Stock, TCG Nonvoting Preferred Stock, TCG Warrants, TCG Stock Options and TCG Restricted Stock Awards by the TCG Insiders, and any acquisitions of MB Common Stock, MB Series A Preferred Stock or the stock issued pursuant to _Section 1.5_ by any TCG Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

    
 6.17 _ Redemption of TCG Series B Preferred Stock. _ Subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, TCG shall use commercially reasonable efforts to repurchase or redeem the 

        

outstanding shares of TCG Series B Preferred Stock prior to February 15,
2014, which is the date that the dividend rate on such securities increases
from the rate in effect on the date hereof.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT 

  

    8.1 _ Termination. _ This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval or
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of MB or TCG:

  

  

 (a) by mutual consent of MB and TCG in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board; 

  

 (b) by either MB or TCG if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

 (c) by either MB or TCG (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June 30, 2014 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date 

  

      

  

shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein, (ii) the TCG Meeting (including any adjournments or postponement
thereof) shall have concluded and the Requisite TCG Vote shall not have been
obtained, or (iii) the MB Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Requisite MB Vote shall
not have been obtained;

   

 (d) by either MB or TCG ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of TCG, in the case of a termination by MB, or MB, in the case of a termination by TCG, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_, in the case of a termination by MB, or _Section 7.3_, in the case of a termination by TCG, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to TCG, in the case of a termination by MB, or to MB, in the case of a termination by TCG, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date); 

  

 (e) by TCG, (i) if the Board of Directors of MB shall have failed to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of MB approve this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to TCG, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within two (2) business days after TCG requests in writing that such action be taken, or (ii) if MB shall have breached its obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _6.11_ in any material respect; 

  

 (f) by MB, (i) if the Board of Directors of TCG shall have failed to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of TCG adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to MB, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within two (2) business days after MB requests in writing that such action be taken, (ii) if the Board of Directors of TCG shall have (A) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal or (B) failed to issue a press release announcing its opposition to a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal within five (5) business days after written request from MB to do so, or (iii) if TCG shall have breached its obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _6.11_ in any material respect; or 

  

 (g) by TCG if TCG receives a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , TCG shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ unless (i) it has not breached _Section 6.3_ or _6.11_ in any material respect, (ii) subsequent to delivering such notice of termination, it intends to enter into a letter of intent, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, and (iii) it has provided MB at least five (5) days prior written notice advising MB that the Board of Directors of TCG is prepared to accept the Superior Proposal and has given MB, if it so elects, an opportunity to amend the terms of this Agreement (and negotiated with MB in good faith with respect to such terms) in such a manner that would enable TCG\'s Board of Directors to proceed with the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ "means an Acquisition Proposal for TCG that is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of TCG, after consultation with TCG\'s financial advisor, to be on terms that are more favorable to the stockholders of TCG than the Merger and that there is a reasonable likelihood of such transaction being consummated in accordance with its terms. 

  

  

    
 8.2 _ Effect of Termination. _ 

  

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either MB or TCG as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of MB, 

  

      

  

TCG, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors
of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i)
_Sections 3.3(a)_, _4.3(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ , this _Section 8.2_ and _Article
IX_ (other than _Section 9.1_) shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, neither MB nor TCG shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

 (b) (i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by MB pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, then TCG shall pay to MB a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount of $20,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") not later than ten (10) business days following such termination of this Agreement; 

    

 (ii) in the event this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or by MB pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ and (A) prior thereto an Acquisition Proposal with respect to TCG shall have been presented or made known to the Board of Directors of TCG or made directly to the stockholders of TCG generally or publicly announced and (B) within twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement TCG enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummates any Acquisition Proposal, then at such time TCG shall pay the Termination Fee to MB, in immediately available funds; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, all references in the definition of Specified Percentage to "24.9%" shall instead refer to "49.9%"; or 

  

 (iii) in the event this Agreement is terminated by TCG pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, then TCG shall pay the Termination Fee to MB, in immediately available funds, not later than the earlier of (A) ten (10) business days following such termination of this Agreement and (B) the date TCG enters into a letter of intent, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to a Superior Proposal. 

    

 (c) (i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by TCG pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then MB shall pay an amount equal to the Termination Fee to TCG in immediately available funds, not later than ten (10) business days following such termination of this Agreement; or 

    

 (ii) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or by TCG pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ and (A) prior thereto an Acquisition Proposal with respect to MB shall have been presented or made known to the Board of Directors of MB or made directly to the stockholders of MB generally or publicly announced and (B) within twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement MB enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummates any Acquisition Proposal, then at such time MB shall pay the Termination Fee to TCG, in immediately available funds. 

    

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by a single party under this _Section 8.2_ shall be equal to the Termination Fee. 

   

 (e) Each of MB and TCG acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if MB or TCG, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the nonpaying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such nonpaying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if MB or TCG, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts 

  

      

  

payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, then such party shall pay interest
on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

  

  

    
 8.3 _ Amendment. _ Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of MB and TCG; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that after approval or adoption of this Agreement by the respective stockholders of MB or TCG, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

    
 8.4 _ Extension; Waiver. _ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after approval or adoption of this Agreement by the respective stockholders of MB or TCG, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  MB FINANCIAL, INC. 

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY 

  

 MB Financial, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Corporation"), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that: 

  

 FIRST: Under a power contained in Article 5 of the charter of the Corporation, the board of directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"), by the following resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors, classified and designated a series of Four Million (4,000,000) shares of preferred stock of the Corporation designated as "Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A" (the "Designated Preferred Stock"): 

  

  

 RESOLVED, that pursuant to the provisions of the charter of the Corporation and applicable law, a series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation be and hereby is created, and that the designation and number of shares of such series, and the preferences, voting powers and other rights, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption, of the shares of such series, are as follows: 

  

 

ARTICLE I

  

DEFINITIONS

  

 "Appropriate Federal Banking Agency" means the "appropriate Federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1813(q)), or any successor provision. 

  

 "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

   

 "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions in Chicago, Illinois are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. 

  

 "Common Stock" means the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation. 

  

 "Corporation" means MB Financial, Inc., a Maryland corporation. 

   

 "Dividend Payment Date" shall have the meaning set forth in Article II, Section 3(a) hereof. 

  

 "Dividend Period" shall have the meaning set forth in Article II, Section 3(a) hereof. 

  

 "Junior Stock" means the Common Stock and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized over which the Series A Preferred Stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 

   

 "Nonpayment" shall have the meaning set forth in Article II, Section 6(b) hereof. 

  

 "Parity Stock" means [the Series B Preferred Stock and] any [other] class or series of stock of the Corporation that ranks on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

Preferred Stock, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial
decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement
interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after the

capital adequacy guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

 ["Series B Preferred Stock" means the Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation.] 

  

ARTICLE II

  

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK

  

 1. _ Designation._ The distinctive serial designation of such series is "Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A." Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series A Preferred Stock. 

  

 2. _ Number of Shares._ The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be 4,000,000. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding) by the Board. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series. The Corporation shall have authority to issue fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

  

 3. _ Dividends._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Rate._ Holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $25 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 beginning on [February 15, 2014]; _provided, however_ , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which dividends are payable a "Dividend Payment Date"). The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a "Dividend Period." Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of $25 per share at a rate _per annum_ equal to 8.00%. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be the fifteenth calendar day preceding such Dividend Payment Date. The amount of dividends payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable thereto, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines. 

  

 (b) _ Non-Cumulative Dividends._ Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock 

  

 

EXHIBIT B PART II-2     

  

on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise,
on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate
and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no
obligation to pay, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
right to receive, dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the
Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or interest with respect to
such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent
Dividend Period with respect to Series A Preferred Stock, Parity Stock,
Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the
Corporation.

  

 (c) _ Priority of Dividends._ So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to _pro rata_ offers to purchase all, or a _pro rata_ portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, during such dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series A Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. If the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends as may be determined by the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available therefor, and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 

  

  

 4. _ Liquidation Rights._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Liquidation._ In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series A Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation\'s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $25 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, 

  

 

EXHIBIT B PART II-3     

  

dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what
is expressly provided for in this Section 4(a).

  

 (b) _ Partial Payment._ If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. 

  

 (c) _ Residual Distributions._ If the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Corporation. 

  

 (d) _ Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation._ For purposes of this Section 4, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. 

  

  

 5. _ Redemption._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Optional Redemption._ Except as described below, the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Corporation prior to February 15, 2018. The Corporation, at the option of the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency and to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent to redemption set forth in the capital guidelines or regulations of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may redeem in whole or from time to time in part the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after February 15, 2018 upon notice given as provided in Section 5(c) below, at the Redemption Price in effect at the redemption date as provided in this Section 5(a). The "Redemption Price" for shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be $25 per share, together (except as otherwise provided herein) with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date (but with no amount in respect of any dividends that have not been declared prior to such date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at any time prior to February 15, 2018, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may provide notice of its intent to redeem as provided in Section 5(c) below, and subsequently redeem, all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at the Redemption Price applicable on such date of redemption. 

  

 (b) _ No Sinking Fund._ The Series A Preferred Stock will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right to require redemption or repurchase of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

  

 (c) _ Notice of Redemption._ Notice of every redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. 

  

 

EXHIBIT B PART II-4     

  

Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 5(c) shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such
notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such
notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred
Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or
any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock at such time and in any manner permitted by such
facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (i) the redemption
date; (ii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed
and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the
number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the Redemption
Price; and (iv) if shares of Series A Preferred Stock are evidenced
by definitive certificates, the place or places where certificates for such
shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price.

  

 (d) _ Partial Redemption._ In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either _pro rata_ or by lot or in such other manner as the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 

  

 (e) _ Effectiveness of Redemption._ If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the Redemption Price of such shares. 

  

  

 6. _ Voting Rights._ 

  

  

 (a) _ General._ The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors of the Corporation, except as set forth below or as otherwise from to time required by law. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have one vote per share on any matter in which holders of such shares are entitled to vote, including when acting by written consent. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have exclusive voting rights on any charter amendment that would alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Corporation\'s charter, of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

  

 (b) _ Right to Elect Two Directors upon a Nonpayment Event._ 

    

 (i) _ Voting Right._ If and whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section have been conferred and are exercisable, [including the Series B Preferred Stock,] have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (each such event, a "Nonpayment"), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board shall automatically be increased by two, and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock (together with holders of 

   

 

EXHIBIT B PART II-5     

   

any other class of the Corporation\'s authorized preferred stock having
equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock
would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in
dividends did not exist), shall have the right, voting separately as a single
class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common
Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created
directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships),
provided that the Board shall at no time include more than two such
directors. Each such director elected by the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on
parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a
"Preferred Stock Director." No person may be elected as a Preferred Stock
Director who would cause the Corporation to violate any corporate governance
requirements of any securities exchange or other trading facility on which the
Corporation\'s securities may then be listed or traded that listed or traded
companies must have a majority of independent directors. The Preferred
Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.

  

 (ii) _ Election; Notice._ The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation\'s stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 6(b)(i) above, the President, the Chairman of the Board, or a majority of the Board may, and within 20 days after the written request of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock (addressed to the Board at the Corporation\'s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in this Section. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation\'s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. 

  

 (iii) _ Removal; Vacancy._ The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting or annual meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation\'s stockholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to this Section.

Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors will cease (but subject

terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate
and the authorized number of directors constituting the Board will be reduced
accordingly.

 (iii) _ Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations and Other Transactions._ Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting corporation, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or a corporation controlling such corporation that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and (y) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such new preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of Series A Preferred Stock. 

    

 (d) _ Changes after Provision for Redemption._ No vote or consent of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be required pursuant to Section 6(c) above if, at or prior to the time when any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for 

  

 

EXHIBIT B PART II-7     

  

redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside
for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 5 above.

 7. _ Conversion or Exchange._ The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert or exchange such Series A Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation. 

  

 8. _ Rank._ Notwithstanding anything set forth in the charter or these articles supplementary to the contrary, the Board or any authorized committee of the Board, without the vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 6 hereof, any class of securities ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

 (b) The term "Date of Termination" means the date upon which the Executive\'s employment with the Bank and, if applicable, the Corporation and any of their respective subsidiaries (each a "Subsidiary" and collectively the "Subsidiaries"), ceases, as specified in a notice of termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof; provided, that "termination," "termination of employment" and "Date of Termination" as used herein are intended to mean a termination of employment which constitutes a "separation from service" under Code Section 409A determined without regard to Executive\'s service as a member of the Board of Directors or of the board of directors of any subsidiary of the Corporation. 

  

 (c) Subject to the remainder of this Section 1(c), the term "Involuntary Termination" means the termination of the employment of the Executive (i) by the Bank without his express written consent or (ii) by the Executive by reason of a material breach of the Agreement by the Bank, including (without limitation) any of the following actions unless consented to in writing by the Executive: (1) a requirement that the Executive be based at any place other than Chicago, Illinois, or within a radius of 35 miles from the location of MB Financial Center at 6111 North River Road, Rosemont, Illinois, except for reasonable travel on Corporation or Bank business; (2) a material demotion of the Executive; (3) a material reduction in the number or seniority of personnel reporting to the Executive or a material reduction in the frequency with which, or in the nature of the matters with respect to which such personnel are to report to the Executive, other than as part of a Corporation or Bank-wide reduction in staff; (4) a material reduction in the Executive\'s Base Salary, other than as part of an overall program applied uniformly and with equitable effect to all senior executives of the Bank and Corporation; (5) a material permanent increase in the required hours of work or the workload of the Executive beyond what is expected of comparably situated bank chief executive officers performing substantially the same duties; (6) the failure to elect, or the removal of, the Executive as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank (or any successor of the Bank); or (7) failure of the Bank to obtain an assumption agreement from a successor as required by Section 12(a) hereof; or (iii) by the Executive within 90 days after he receives written notice from the Bank pursuant to Section 2 hereof that the term of this Agreement will not be extended. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in order for Executive\'s resignation pursuant to clause (ii) above to constitute an Involuntary Termination, the Executive shall be required to comply with the notice and other provisions of Section 9\. The term "Involuntary Termination" does not include Termination for Cause, termination of employment due to death or disability or termination pursuant to Section 7(g) of this Agreement, or suspension or temporary or permanent prohibition from participation in the conduct of the Bank\'s affairs under Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 

  

 (d) The terms "Termination for Cause" and "Terminated For Cause" mean termination of the employment of the Executive with the Bank, or if applicable, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, because of the Executive\'s willful misconduct, breach of a fiduciary duty involving 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-2     

  

personal profit, repeated failure to perform stated duties (after written
notice and reasonable opportunity to cure), willful violation of any law,
rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or
final cease-and-desist order issued by a federal banking regulator, or (except
as provided below) material breach of any provision of this Agreement (after
written notice and reasonable opportunity to cure). No act or failure to act
by the Executive shall be considered willful unless the Executive acted or
failed to act in bad faith and without a reasonable belief that his action or
failure to act was in the best interest of the Corporation or the Bank. The
Executive shall not be deemed to have been Terminated for Cause unless and
until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority
of the entire membership of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board
of Directors duly called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice
to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the
Executive\'s counsel, to be heard before the Board of Directors), stating
that in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors the Executive has
engaged in conduct described in the preceding sentence and specifying the
particulars thereof in detail.

   

 (e) The term "Voluntary Termination" shall mean termination of employment by the Executive voluntarily as set forth in Section 7(d) of this Agreement. 

  

  

    
 2. _ Term. _ This Agreement and Executive\'s employment under this Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date, provided Executive has remained in the continuous employment of TCG and Cole Taylor Bank through immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. The term of this Agreement shall be a period of three years commencing on the Effective Date hereof, subject to earlier termination as provided herein, and upon the second anniversary of the Effective Date, and on each anniversary thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other party at least 90 days prior to such second or any subsequent anniversary. 

  

    
 3. _ Employment. _ The Executive shall be employed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. As such, the Executive shall have such duties, authority and responsibility as are customary for an officer having similar executive capacities, and shall have such other powers and duties as the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the Bank (the "Bank Board") may prescribe from time to time consistent with services performed by similarly situated executives and consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Executive shall also render services without additional compensation to the Corporation and any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as requested by the Corporation from time to time. The Executive shall report to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and to the Bank Board. The Executive shall also serve as a member of the Bank Board and may serve as a member of the board of directors of any Subsidiary. The Executive shall devote his best efforts and reasonable time and attention to the business and affairs of the Bank, and the Corporation and the Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to discharge his responsibilities hereunder. The Executive may (a) serve on charitable boards or committees at the Executive\'s discretion without consent of the Board of Directors and, in addition, on such corporate boards as are approved in a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors, and (b) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not interfere materially with performance of his responsibilities hereunder. 

  

    
 4. _ Compensation. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Salary._ The Bank agrees to pay the Executive during the term of this Agreement a base salary (the "Base Salary") the annualized amount of which shall be not less than $700,000. The Base Salary shall be paid no less frequently than monthly and shall be subject to customary tax withholding. The amount of the Base Salary may be increased (but under no circumstances may the Base Salary be decreased) from time to time in accordance with the amounts of salary approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof (the "Committee"). In order to 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-3     

  

effectuate the purpose of the preceding sentence, the amount of the Base
Salary shall be reviewed by the Committee or Board of Directors at least every
year during the term of this Agreement. If and to the extent that the
Corporation and/or any Subsidiaries pay salary or other amounts or provide
benefits to the Executive that the Bank is obligated to pay or to provide to
the Executive under this Agreement, the Bank\'s obligations to the Executive
shall be reduced accordingly.

  

 (b) _ Annual Incentive Bonus._ Upon commencing employment, Executive will be eligible to participate in the Corporation\'s annual incentive compensation program. Eligibility and benefits shall be determined by the terms of the program as then in effect. Executive\'s annual incentive target shall be 75% of Executive\'s Base Salary, although Executive\'s actual award ("Annual Cash Bonus"), if any, shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the program. The Annual Cash Bonus earned by the Executive for a calendar year shall be paid within two and one-half (21/2) months after the last day of such calendar year. Executive shall also be entitled to receive such other annual bonus compensation, if any, as the Committee or Board of Directors may in its sole discretion, award to Executive. 

  

 (c) _ Stock-Based Incentive Compensation._ In accordance with the Merger Agreement, to the extent pre-established performance goals under the LTIP (as defined in Section 5.2(f) of the TCG Disclosure Schedule to the Merger Agreement)(the "TCG LTIP") are satisfied, Executive will receive an award under the TCG LTIP on or before March 15, 2014. Commencing in 2015, each calendar year while the Executive is employed pursuant to this Agreement, he shall be considered for an award of stock options and/or other stock-based awards ("Stock-Based Awards") under the Corporation\'s Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan and any successor or substitute for such plan (the "Omnibus Incentive Plan") by the Committee at such time as awards are granted to other senior executives of the Bank. Executive\'s annual target grant date value for Stock-Based Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan shall be 125% of the Base Salary earned by the Executive for the preceding calendar year, although Executive\'s actual Stock-Based Awards, if any, shall be determined by the Committee or Board of Directors utilizing the same methodology that is used for grants of annual Stock-Based Awards granted at such time to other senior executives of the Bank. The Stock-Based Awards will be made in the form of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares or other forms of award permitted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and the mix and terms and conditions of which shall be no less favorable than the awards made at such time to the other senior executives of the Bank or Corporation. 

  

 (d) _ Expenses._ The Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services under this Agreement in accordance with the policies and procedures applicable to the senior executives of the Bank; _provided that_ the Executive accounts for such expenses as required under such policies and procedures. 

   

 (e) _ Effective Date Award._ In consideration for Executive\'s acceptance of employment with the Bank under the terms and provisions of this Agreement, on or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Committee or Board of Directors shall grant to Executive a restricted stock award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Effective Date Award"). The Effective Date Award shall be for that number of shares of common stock of the Corporation which, based on the closing price of the common stock on the Effective Date, has a value of $1.25 million. The Effective Date Award will vest in 25% increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the Effective Date; provided, that the Effective Date Award shall vest in full upon Executive\'s Date of Termination where such Executive\'s termination of employment is an Involuntary Termination or due to Executive\'s death or disability. The other terms and conditions of the Effective Date Award shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of the annual restricted stock grants made to senior executives under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-4      

    
 5. _ Employee Benefits. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Participation in Benefit Plans._ While the Executive is employed by the Bank, the Executive shall be entitled to participate, to the same extent as senior executives of the Bank generally, in the plans, programs and practices of the Bank relating to retirement, profit-sharing, savings, group or other life insurance, hospitalization, medical and dental coverage, travel and accident insurance, education and other employee benefits, in each case in accordance with the applicable plan documents as in effect from time to time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive shall be designated as a participant under the MB Financial Non-Stock Deferred Compensation Plan and the MB Financial Stock Deferred Compensation Plan and shall be entitled to make voluntary deferrals and receive Bank contributions thereunder on a basis no less favorable than applicable to those senior executives of the Bank or Corporation (other than the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation) who are participants in such plans. 

  

 (b) _ Fringe Benefits._ While Executive is employed by the Bank, Executive shall be eligible to participate in and receive benefits under fringe benefit programs which are or may become generally available to the Bank\'s and Corporation\'s senior executives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bank agrees to pay for Executive\'s membership dues for Westmoreland Country Club and The Chicago Club. 

  

  

    
 6. _ Vacations; Leave. _ The Executive shall be entitled (i) to annual paid vacation in accordance with the policies established by the Board of Directors which shall not be less favorable than that provided to any other senior executives of the Bank or Corporation, and (ii) to voluntary leaves of absence, with or without pay, from time to time at such times and upon such conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its discretion. 

  

    
 7. _ Termination of Employment. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Involuntary Termination._ If the Executive experiences an Involuntary Termination prior to (and not in connection with) a Change in Control, such termination of employment shall be subject to the Bank\'s obligations under this Section 7(a) in lieu of any other compensation and employee benefits under this Agreement. In the event of such Involuntary Termination, the Effective Date Award shall become fully vested in accordance with Section 4(e), any unvested TCG Restricted Stock Award (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall become fully vested, and Bank shall pay to the Executive monthly, during the twenty-four months after the Date of Termination, an amount equal to the sum of: (i) one-twelfth of the Base Salary at the annual rate in effect under Section 4(a) immediately prior to the Date of Termination, (ii) one-twelfth of the average Annual Cash Bonus, based on the average amount of such Annual Cash Bonus for the two full calendar years preceding the Date of Termination (or, if such Date of Termination occurs prior to the completion of two full calendar years of employment after the Effective Date, then the target bonus for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs shall be substituted for each uncompleted calendar year) and (iii) for up to eighteen months, an amount equal to 150% of the monthly premium paid by the Executive for COBRA coverage elected by Executive under Bank\'s group health plan. In addition to the foregoing, in connection with an Involuntary Termination, the Executive shall be entitled to receive (A) any accrued Base Salary through the Date of Termination within 30 days after the Date of Termination, (B) any unpaid Annual Cash Bonus earned by the Executive for the preceding calendar year within the time period set forth in Section 4(b) hereof, (C) prompt reimbursement of any expenses incurred through the Date of Termination in accordance with Section 4(d), and (D) all vested employee benefits described in Section 5 hereof (collectively, the "Accrued Compensation") such benefits to be paid in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable plan, program, arrangement or agreement. If the Executive should die after amounts become payable under this Section 7(a), such amounts shall thereafter be paid to the Executive\'s estate until satisfied in full. 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-5     

  

 (b) _ Change in Control._ If the Executive experiences an Involuntary Termination in connection with or within 24 months following a Change in Control which occurs after the Effective Date, such termination of employment shall, in lieu of any other compensation and employee benefits under this Agreement, be subject to the Bank\'s (or its successor-in-interest\'s) obligations under this Section 7(b). 

    

 (i) _ Accrued Compensation._ In addition to any other amounts to which the Executive may be entitled to receive under this Section 7(b), the Bank (or its successor-in-interest) shall pay to the Executive the Accrued Compensation. 

   

 (ii) _ Change in Control Payment._ The Bank (or its successor-in-interest) shall pay to the Executive in cash, within 30 days after the Date of Termination, an amount equal to three times the sum of the Base Salary and the target Annual Cash Bonus in effect under Sections 4(a) and 4(b) respectively, immediately prior to the Date of Termination. 

  

 (iii) _ COBRA Premium Reimbursement._ For a period up to eighteen months, the Bank (or its successor-in-interest) shall pay Executive monthly an amount equal to 150% of the monthly premium paid by the Executive for COBRA coverage elected by Executive under Bank\'s group health plan. 

   

 (iv) _ Vesting of Certain Awards._ The Effective Date Award shall become fully vested in accordance with Section 4(e) and any unvested TCG Restricted Stock Award (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall become fully vested. 

    

 If the Executive should die after amounts become payable under any provision of this Section 7(b), such amounts shall thereafter be paid to the Executive\'s estate until satisfied in full. 

  

 (c) _ Termination for Cause._ In the event of Termination for Cause, the Bank shall have no further obligation to the Executive under this Agreement after the Date of Termination except for the Accrued Compensation. 

  

 (d) _ Voluntary Termination._ The Executive may terminate his employment voluntarily at any time by a notice pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement. In the event that the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment other than by reason of any of the actions that constitute Involuntary Termination ("Voluntary Termination"), the Bank shall be obligated to the Executive only for the amount of the Accrued Compensation, and the Bank shall have no further obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. 

  

 (e) _ Death._ In the event of the death of Executive during the term of this Agreement and prior to any termination of employment, the Bank shall pay to the Executive\'s estate the Accrued Compensation. In addition, the Effective Date Award shall become fully vested in accordance with Section 4(e) and any unvested TCG Restricted Stock Award (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall become fully vested. 

   

 (f) _ Disability._ If the Executive becomes entitled to benefits under the terms of the then-current disability plan, if any, of the Bank (a "Disability Plan"), he shall be entitled to receive such group and other disability benefits, if any, as are then provided by the Bank for senior executives. In the event of such disability, this Agreement shall not be suspended, except that (i) the Bank\'s obligation to pay the Base Salary to the Executive shall be reduced in accordance with the amount of disability income benefits received by the Executive, if any, pursuant to this Section 7(f) such that, on an after-tax basis, the Executive shall realize from the sum of disability income benefits and Base Salary the same amount as he would realize on an after-tax basis from the Base Salary if the Bank\'s obligation to pay salary were not reduced pursuant to this Section 7(f); (ii) the Executive shall not be entitled to earn an Annual Cash Bonus pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof or Stock-Based Awards pursuant to Section 4(c) if the disability prevents the 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-6     

  

Executive from rendering full-time service to the Bank for a period of in
excess of six months during an applicable calendar year; and (iii) upon a
resolution adopted by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors, the Bank may discontinue payment of the Base Salary beginning six
months following a determination that the Executive has become entitled to
benefits under a Disability Plan or otherwise unable to fulfill his duties
under this Agreement. The Bank may terminate the employment of the Executive
at any time after the expiration of one year following such disability if
such disability is then continuing, and upon such termination the Executive
shall be entitled to receive only the Accrued Compensation. In addition, the
Effective Date Award shall become fully vested in accordance with Section
4(e) and any unvested TCG Restricted Stock Award (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) shall become fully vested.

   

 (g) _ Regulatory Action._ Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, if the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank\'s affairs by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(e)(4) and (g)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, except for the obligation of the Bank to pay the Accrued Compensation. 

  

 (h) _ No Other Obligation to Mitigate Damages; No Offset._ Except as provided in Section 7(i), Executive shall not be obligated to mitigate amounts payable or arrangements made under the provisions of this Section 7 and the obtaining of other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the Bank\'s obligations under this Section 7\. Except as provided in Section 7(i), the Bank\'s obligation to make payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Bank may have against the Executive or others. 

  

 (i) _ Release and Restrictive Covenants._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank\'s obligations to pay or provide any benefits under this Section 7 above shall (i) cease as of the date the Executive knowingly and materially violates the provisions of Section 8 hereof and (ii) be conditioned on the Executive signing a release of claims in favor of the Bank in the form annexed hereto within forty-five (45) days of such termination and the expiration of any revocation period provided for in such release. 

  

  

    
 8. _ Protective Covenants Agreement. _ On or prior to the Effective Date, the Executive shall enter into an MB Financial Protective Covenants Agreement (the "Protective Covenants Agreement"), a form of which has been provided to Executive. The Executive agrees to be subject to and bound by all terms and conditions of the Protective Covenants Agreement during the period of employment and, to the extent provided therein, thereafter, as if such terms and conditions were set forth in full herein. References in this Agreement to Executive\'s obligations under Section 8 shall mean references to his obligations under the Protective Covenants Agreement. 

  

    
 9. _ Notice of Termination. _ Subject to the provisions of Section 1(d) hereof, in the event that the Corporation or the Bank, or both, desire to terminate the employment of the Executive during the term of this Agreement, the Corporation or the Bank, or both, shall deliver to the Executive a written notice of termination, stating whether such termination constitutes Termination for Cause, Involuntary Termination or termination for disability, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that are the basis for the termination, and specifying the date upon which employment shall terminate, which date shall be at least 30 days after the date upon which the notice is delivered, except in the case of Termination for Cause. In the event that the Executive determines in good faith that he has experienced an Involuntary Termination of his employment in accordance with Section 1(c)(ii), he shall (a) send a written notice to the Corporation and Bank stating the circumstances that constitute such Involuntary Termination, which notice shall be given within 90 days of the Executive\'s first learning of such circumstances and shall state his intention to terminate his employment due to such Involuntary 

  

EXHIBIT E-7      

Termination and (b) provide the Corporation and Bank with 30 days from the
date of such notice to cure such circumstances. If the Corporation and Bank
fails to cure such circumstances, then Executive will be deemed to have
terminated his employment due to Involuntary Termination at the end of such
30-day period. In the event that the Executive desires to effect a
Voluntary Termination, he shall deliver a written notice to the Corporation
and Bank, stating the date upon which employment shall terminate, which date
shall be at least 90 days after the date upon which the notice is delivered,
unless the Corporation or Bank requests a date sooner.

  

    
 10. _ Professional Fees. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Bank shall pay the reasonable legal fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts, evidence and counsel) incurred by the Executive as a result of the Executive\'s seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement or by any other plan or arrangement maintained by the Bank (or any successor), the Corporation or the Consolidated Subsidiaries under which the Executive is or may be entitled to receive benefits; _provided that_ the Bank\'s obligation to pay such fees and expenses is subject to the Executive\'s prevailing with respect to the matters in dispute. 

  

 (b) The Bank shall reimburse the Executive for any professional fees (attorneys, accountants, tax advisers) incurred by the Executive in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement, but in an amount not to exceed $15,000. 

  

  

    
 11. _ Indemnification. _ During Executive\'s term of employment with the Bank and, if applicable, the Corporation and/or any Subsidiaries and thereafter, the Corporation and Bank shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless to the maximum extent now or hereafter permitted under the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation or Bank, as applicable. In the event that legal action is instituted or threatened against the Executive during or after the term of his employment with, or membership on the board of directors of, the Bank, the Corporation or any Subsidiary, in connection with such employment or membership, the Corporation or Bank will advance to the Executive the costs and expenses incurred by Executive in the defense of such action (including reasonable attorneys, expert and other professional fees) to the maximum extent permitted by law without prejudice to or waiver by the Corporation or Bank of its rights and remedies against the Executive. In the event that there is a final judgment entered against the Executive in any such litigation which, in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, is not subject to indemnification, then the Executive shall reimburse the Corporation or Bank for all such costs and expenses paid or incurred by it in the Executive\'s defense of such litigation (the "Reimbursement Amount"). The Reimbursement Amount shall be paid by the Executive within 30 days after rendition of the final judgment and a determination by the Board of Directors that such costs and expenses are not subject to indemnification. The parties shall cooperate in the defense of any asserted claim, demand or liability against the Executive or the Bank, Corporation, Subsidiary or any other affiliates. The term "final judgment" as used herein shall be defined to mean the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, and in the event of an appeal, then the decision of the appellate court, after petition for rehearing has been denied, or the time for filing the same (or the filing of further appeal) has expired. The rights to indemnification under this Section 11 shall be in addition to any rights which Executive may now or hereafter have under any insurance contract maintained by the Bank, Corporation, or any Subsidiary or other affiliates or any other agreement between Executive, Bank, Corporation, Subsidiary or any other affiliates. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Executive\'s indemnification rights under this Section 11, the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation or Bank and applicable law, shall survive the termination of Executive\'s employment with the Bank and his membership on the board of directors of the Bank, Corporation or any Subsidiary. 

  

EXHIBIT E-8      

    
 12. _ No Assignments. _ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto, and neither may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of the other party; _provided, however_ , that this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor of the Bank and the Bank shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by an assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Executive\'s resignation following the failure of the Bank to obtain such an assumption agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 1(c). 

  

 (b) This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive\'s personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 

  

  

    
 13. _ Notice. _ For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or five days after the date that sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the Corporation and Bank at their respective home offices, to the attention of the Board of Directors and Bank Board, as applicable, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation, or, if to the Executive, to such home or other address as the Executive has most recently provided in writing to the Bank. 

  

    
 14. _ Amendments. _ No amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. 

   

    
 15. _ Headings. _ The headings used in this Agreement are included solely for convenience and shall not affect, or be used in connection with, the interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

    
 16. _ Severability. _ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. 

  

    
 17. _ Governing Law. _ This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. 

  

    
 18. _ Successors to Code Sections. _ All provisions of this Agreement referring to sections of the U.S.C. (United States Code) or to the Code shall be deemed to refer to successor code sections in the event of renumbering of code sections. 

  

    
 19. _ Existing Employment Agreement; Effect on Other Agreements. _ As of the Effective Date, this Agreement shall supersede and replace the Existing Employment Agreement in its entirety, the Existing Employment Agreement shall terminate and have no further force or effect and neither the Corporation nor Bank shall have any obligation, nor the Executive have any claims for severance or other payments, under the Existing Employment Agreement. The TCG 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan and Executive\'s TCG Restricted Stock Awards (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be assumed in accordance with the Merger Agreement. 

  

    
 20. _ Code Section 409A. _ 

  

  

 (a) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively "Code Section 409A") and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If the Executive notifies the Bank and Corporation (with specificity as to the reason therefore) that the Executive believes that any 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-9     

  

provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including
equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur any
additional tax or interest under Code Section 409A and the Bank or
Corporation concurs with such belief or the Bank (without any obligation
whatsoever to do so) independently makes such determination, the Bank or
Corporation shall, after consulting with the Executive, reform such provision
to try to comply with Code Section 409A through good faith modifications to
the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Code Section 409A.
To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with
Code Section 409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to
the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and
economic benefit to the Executive and the Bank or Corporation of the
applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code Section 409A.
No action or failure by the Bank or Corporation in good faith to act, pursuant
to this Section 20, shall subject the Bank or Corporation to any claim,
liability, or expense, and neither the Bank nor the Corporation shall have
any obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Executive from the
obligation to pay any taxes pursuant to Section 409A. The Bank and
Corporation do not make any representations as to the personal income tax
treatment of any severance payments or other benefits provided to the
Executive.

  

 (b) If the Executive is deemed on the date of "separation from service" to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit which constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A to which the six-month delay provisions of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) apply, such payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such "separation from service" of the Executive, and (B) the date of the Executive\'s death (the "Delay Period"). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 20(b) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Whenever a payment (i) is to be made promptly after a date, it shall be made within sixty (60) days thereafter or (ii) specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Bank or Corporation. The Executive\'s right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. 

  

 (c) With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits: (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year, provided that the foregoing shall not be violated with regard to expenses covered by Code Section 105(h) that are subject to a limit related to the period in which the arrangement is in effect. Any expense or other reimbursement payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Bank or Corporation referred to herein, shall be made on or before the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expense or other payment is to be reimbursed. 

  

 (d) If the sixty (60) day period following the Executive\'s "separation from service" begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year (a "Crossover 60-Day Period"), and if there are any payments which constitute non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A due the Executive that are: (i) conditioned on the Executive signing and not revoking a release of claims and (ii) otherwise due to be paid during the portion of the Crossover 

  

 

EXHIBIT E-10     

  

60-Day Period that falls within the first year, then such payments will be
delayed and paid in a lump sum during the portion of the Crossover 60-Day
Period that falls within the second year.

  

  

    
 21. _ No Excise Tax Gross-Up; Possible Reduction in Payments. _ Any provision of this Agreement or any other compensation plan, program or agreement to which Executive is a party or under which Executive is covered to the contrary notwithstanding, Executive will not be entitled to any gross-up or other payment for golden parachute excise taxes Executive may owe pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event that any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7 hereof or other payments or benefits otherwise payable to Executive (a) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (b) but for this Section 21 would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such amounts payable under this Agreement and under such other plans, programs and agreements shall be either (i) delivered in full, or (ii) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any equivalent state or local excise taxes), results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction in payments and/or benefits required by this Section 21 shall occur in the following order: (1) reduction of amounts payable under Section 7(a) or 7(b)(ii) or other cash payments, beginning with payments scheduled to occur soonest; (2) reduction of vesting acceleration of equity awards (in reverse order of the date of the grant); and (3) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to Executive. 

  

    
 22. _ Regulatory Requirements and Compensation Recovery (Clawback). _ Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it is intended that, to the extent required, this Agreement, and any compensation described herein or made hereunder, comply with any legislative or regulatory limitations or requirements which are or may become applicable to the Bank, Corporation or any subsidiary or to any such payments, including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations issued thereunder (collectively, the "Regulatory Requirements"). Such limitations or requirements may include, but not limited to, provisions limiting, delaying or deferring payment of certain bonus, incentive or retention compensation to certain officers or highly compensated employees, requiring that the Corporation or Bank recover (clawback) bonus and incentive compensation in certain circumstances, and precluding or requiring modifications to bonus and incentive arrangements that may subject the Corporation or Bank to inappropriate risk or may result in excessive compensation. The Executive acknowledges this Agreement and Executive\'s bonus, stock-based or other incentive compensation payments or awards will be subject to any such clawback provisions and to possible change due to applicable Regulatory Requirements.

Should any provision of this Agreement and General Release be declared illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction and should the provision be incapable of being modified to be enforceable, such provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement and General Release in full force and effect. Nothing herein, however, shall operate to void or nullify any general release language contained in the Agreement and General Release. 

  

 7. _ Nonadmission of Wrongdoing_. Executive agrees neither this Agreement and General Release nor the furnishing of the consideration for this Release shall be deemed or construed at any time for any purpose as an admission by Corporation of any liability or unlawful conduct of any kind.
