 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated
as of July 3, 2007, among Hilton Hotels Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), BH Hotels LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Parent_ "), and BH Hotels Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the Company and Merger
Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "
_Constituent Corporations_ ").

  

RECITALS

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Merger Sub and the
Company and the managing members of Parent have approved this Agreement and
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement.

  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, Blackstone Real Estate Partners VI L.P. and Blackstone Capital
Partners V L.P. (the " _Guarantors_ ") are entering into a guarantee with the
Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantors are
guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the
" _Buyer Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement.

  

WHEREAS, the Company and the Buyer Parties desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  

# ARTICLE I

  

# _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

  

## 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the Company shall continue its corporate
existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the
effects provided by this Agreement and the DGCL and other applicable Law.     

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 1888 Century Park East,
Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California, at 6:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) as promptly
as practicable (but in no event later than the third (3rd) third business
day) (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York and the City of Los Angeles.

  

## 1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed by the office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

# ARTICLE II

  

# _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  

## 2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as to read in
its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Charter_ "), until duly
amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be Hilton Hotels Corporation and the provision in
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall
be omitted.

  

## 2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

        



  

# ARTICLE III

  

# _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

  

## 3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, consist of the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL.

  

## 3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time (other
than Stephen Bollenbach) shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter, Bylaws and the
DGCL.

  

# ARTICLE IV

  

# _Effect of the Merger; 
 Exchange of Certificates_

  

## 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, the
holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub:

  

### (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value
$2.50 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(each Share referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) being an " _Excluded
Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted
into the right to receive $47.50 per Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than the
Shares to remain outstanding pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and each
certificate formerly represent­ing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which
reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

        



  

### (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than
Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
the Company and not held on behalf of third parties, which shall remain
outstanding) referred to in Section 4.1(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(ii) shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the holder of any
Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(ii) to receive the payment to
which reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent
to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively, in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned
to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under Section 4.1(a).

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any
event within five (5) business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the

        

### Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may
be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

### (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

        



  

### (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

### (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned
by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder.
The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) shall permit Parent to direct and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal
under the DGCL.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent given (or not) in its sole and absolute discretion, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  

### (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

## 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  

(a) _Options_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the holder and
Parent, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a
" _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled and shall only

        

entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than seven (7) business
days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to

Equity Compensation Plan of the Company, shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable

days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to such Performance Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time using the achievement level under the respective award
agreement and 2004 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan of the Company set forth
in Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter _times_ (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Performance
Units granted in January 2005 shall be terminated for no consideration.

  

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
holder and Parent, at the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit (an " _RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans, shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than seven (7) business
days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to such RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _times_  (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

(d) _Company Awards_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the holder and
Parent, at the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and
each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any
other Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, the stock units under the

amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time _times_  (y)
the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for
payments to the extent the

        



  

value of the Shares exceeds a specified reference price, the amount, if any,
by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price),
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

  

(e) _Corporate Actions_.  At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions to
implement the provisions of Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c) and 4.3(d)
(including any agreements in writing between a holder and Parent).  The
Company hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 4.3, prior to the Effective Time the Company will make
alternative appropriate proposals to those contained in Sections 4.3(a),
4.3(b), 4.3(c) and 4.3(d) above in any jurisdiction where a statutory
corporation tax deduction or other taxation benefit would be available in
respect of any Company Options, RSUs, Performance Units or any other share-
based awards existing under the Stock Plans, so as to make reasonable efforts
to ensure that such statutory corporation tax deduction or other taxation
benefit is obtained.

  

## 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Subject to compliance with
Section 6.1, in the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of
a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock

as promptly as practicable following the date of receipt of the Offer
Documents from Parent pursuant to subparagraph (c) below and written
instructions from Parent to commence the Debt Offers (as defined below),
offers to purchase, and related consent solicitations (or, in the case of the
3.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the " _Convertible Senior Notes_
"), a consent solicitation which is not related to a concurrent offer to
purchase) with respect to Senior Notes (as defined below) on the terms and
conditions set forth in Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (or as
may otherwise be agreed between the Company and Parent) and such other
customary terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company (including the related or stand-alone consent solicitations,
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_  that (i) this Agreement
shall have not been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, (ii) the
Company shall have received from Parent the completed Offer Documents which
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and
(iii) at the time of such commencement, the Buyer Parties shall have
otherwise performed or complied with all of their agreements and covenants
required by this Agreement to be performed on or

  

### 

        



  

### prior to the time that the Debt Offers are to be commenced. The Company
shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the
Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no order
prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested
by Parent in writing and shall not, without the written consent of Parent,
waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers
other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. The Company does not
need to make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Offers without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, _provided_  that such consent shall not be required for (A) an
increase in any consideration payable in the Debt Offers, (B) any extension
of any consent date, price determination date, settlement date or expiration
date, (C) any change in the provisions of the indentures governing the Senior

### (b) The Company agrees that, promptly following the consent expiration
date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as is necessary shall execute supplemental indentures to the
indentures governing the Senior Notes, which supplemental indentures shall
implement the amendments set forth in the Offer Documents and shall become
operative upon acceptance of the Senior Notes for payment pursuant to the
Debt Offers (or in the case of a Debt Offer which is a stand-alone consent
solicitation, the conditions thereto being satisfied or waived) and
concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to accept for payment and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
promptly pay for the Senior Notes that have been properly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and, subject to receipt of the
requisite consents, pay for consents validly delivered and not revoked in
accordance with the Debt Offers.

  

### (c) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent, at its own
expense, shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Offers, including the offers to purchase, related
consents and letters of transmittal and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate

        

### with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer
Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings
to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall
be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and
shall be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If at
any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the
Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party in writing, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the
Company to the holders of the applicable Senior Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 4.5, the Company shall comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and any other applicable Law to the extent
such Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offers. To the extent
that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this Section 4.5, the
Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have
breached their obligations hereunder by such compliance.

  

### (d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers or solicitation agents (of which one such dealer manager or
solicitation agent shall be UBS Securities LLC and which others will be
reasonably acceptable to the Company), information agents, depositaries and
other agents to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company
shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements
(including indemnities) with such parties so selected and on terms and
conditions acceptable to Parent. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of
any dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers, and Parent further
agrees to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable fees and expenses of
their Representatives) in connection with the Debt Offers promptly following
incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs. The Buyer
Parties shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries, their Representatives (other than any direct
indemnification of any dealer manager or solicitation agent, which shall be
indemnified under the applicable dealer manager or solicitation agent
agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parties shall indemnify
the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any dealer manager
or solicitation agent agreement) from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offers and
the Offer Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that none 

        

### of the Buyer Parties shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless any such party or person to the extent that such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred arises from disclosure regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries supplied by such party or person or included in any
Company Report that is determined to have contained a material misstatement
or omission.

  

### (e) To the extent that, as of the Closing Date, the requisite consents
specified in Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Letter have not been
validly delivered (without having been properly withdrawn) in accordance with
the Debt Offers with respect to any series of Senior Notes by the holders
thereof, at the request of Parent, the Company shall, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, issue an irrevocable notice of optional redemption for
all of the then outstanding Senior Notes of such series as have not delivered
the requisite consents and which are redeemable in accordance with the terms
of such series of Senior Notes and the applicable indenture governing such
series of Senior Notes and which shall provide for the satisfaction and
discharge of such Senior Notes and such indentures with respect to such
series of Senior Notes or assist Parent in making arrangements for the
defeasance of any such series of Notes in accordance with the terms of the
applicable indenture and the terms of such series to the extent that such
instruments permit such defeasance; _provided_ , Parent shall have provided
written notice to the Company confirming that all conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (or with respect to Section 7.2
waived) and that the Buyer Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with
the Closing; and provided further that, Parent shall irrevocably deposit with
the applicable trustee under the applicable indenture at the Closing
sufficient funds or securities, as applicable, to effect such satisfaction
and discharge or defeasance.

### (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.  Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate, limited partnership, limited
liability company or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or similar entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended to the date hereof (collectively, the " _Organizational
Documents_ "), and each as so made available is in effect on the date hereof.
 Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) no dissolution, revocation or
forfeiture proceedings regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
been commenced and (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the Organizational Documents.

  

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of
the securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting
power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons
performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by
such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries; (ii) " _Significant
Subsidiary_ " means those Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Section
5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter; (iii) " _Affiliate_ " means, with
respect to any Person, any other Person, directly or indirectly, controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with, such Person. For purposes of
this definition, the term "control" (including the correlative terms
"controlling", "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, as trustee or executor, by contract, credit
agreement or otherwise; and (iv) " _Company Material __ Adverse Effect_"
means an effect, event, development or change that is materially adverse to
the financial condition, business, assets, or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that
none of the following shall constitute or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is a Company Material Adverse Effect:

  

##### (A) changes in conditions in the U.S. or global economy or capital or
financial markets generally, including changes in interest or exchange rates;

        

##### (B) changes in Law or tax, regulatory, political or business conditions
that, in each case, generally affect the geographic regions or industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct their business (unless, and
only to the extent, such effect, event, development or change affects the
Company and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate manner as compared to
other Persons or participants in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct their business and that operate in the geographic
regions affected by such effect, event, development or change),

  

##### (C) changes in GAAP or interpretation thereof after the date hereof,

  

##### (D) the negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the impact thereof on
the Companys credit ratings and/or relationships, contractual or otherwise,
with tenants, suppliers, lenders, financing sources, investors, venture
partners or employees,

  

##### (E) acts of war, armed hostilities, sabotage or terrorism, or any
escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, armed hostilities, sabotage
or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement (unless,
and only to the extent, such effect, event, development or change affects the
Company and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate manner as compared to
other Persons or participants in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct their business and that operate in the geographic
regions affected by such effect, event, development or change),

  

##### (F) earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters (unless, and
only to the extent, such effect, event, development or change affects the
Company and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate manner as compared to
other persons or participants in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct their business and that operate in the geographic
regions affected by such effect, event, development or change),

  

##### (G) any action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the request
or with the consent of any of the Buyer Parties,

  

##### (H) any failure by the Company to meet any internal or public
projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for any period
ending on or after the date of this Agreement, _provided_  that any effect,
event, development or change underlying such failure shall be considered in
determining whether there has been or is a Company Material Adverse Effect,
or

        

##### (I) any action brought or threatened by or on behalf of any holder of
equity interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

##### With respect to references to Company Material Adverse Effect in the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1(d), the exceptions
set forth in clause (D) shall not apply. The parties agree that the mere fact
of a decrease in the market price of the Shares shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, but any effect, event,
development or change underlying such decrease (other than any such effects,
events, developments or changes set forth in clauses (A) through (I)
above) shall be considered in determining whether there has been or is a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### (b) _Capital Structure_.

  

#### (i) The authorized Common Stock of the Company consists of 500,000,000
Shares, of which 389,985,067 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on June 29, 2007; and the authorized Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Company consists of 24,832,700 shares, none of which
were outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As
of June 29, 2007, there were Company Options to purchase 14,564,758 Shares
outstanding, 4,755,791 RSUs outstanding, Performance Units that have been

Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and, except for directors qualifying shares, and as
would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest,
claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, performance units,

        

#### redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans
or conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, such Shares will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and
clear of any Liens. Except for the Convertible Senior Notes, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter. For purposes of this Agreement,
a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall include any Subsidiary of the
Company of which all of the shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary, other
than director qualifying shares, are owned by the Company (or a wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company). Since June 29, 2007 and through the date
of this Agreement, other than the issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise
of Company Options, the issuance of shares pursuant to RSUs, Performance
Units or Company Awards or the conversion of Convertible Senior Notes, in
each case outstanding as of June 29, 2007, there has been no change in the
number of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company or the number of
Company Options, RSUs or Performance Units.

  

#### (ii) The Company has provided Parent with a list of the Company Options
(with the exercise prices thereunder), RSUs, Performance Units and other
Company Awards, in each case outstanding as of June 29, 2007, and the name of
the Person to whom such Company Options, RSUs, Performance Units and other
Company Awards have been granted.

  

#### (iii) Except as set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation
or the Companys bylaws, there are no agreements or understandings to which
the Company is a party with respect to the voting of any Shares or which
restrict the transfer of any such shares, nor as of the date of this
Agreement does the Company have knowledge of any third party agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting of any such shares.

  

#### (iv) As of June 29, 2007, there was no outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of $10,000,000
in principal amount, other than indebtedness in the amounts identified by
instrument in Section 5.1(b)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
excluding inter-

        

#### company indebtedness among the Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantees by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of the indebtedness of any other Person.

  

#### (v) The Company does not have a "poison pill" or similar stockholder
rights plan.

  

### (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Opinion of Company Financial

materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

#### (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation

#### (ii) other than regular quarterly dividends on Shares (at the rate of
$0.04 per Share for each regular quarterly dividend), any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect
to any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(except for dividends or other distributions by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company); or

  

#### (iii) any material change in any tax method or election by the Company
or any Subsidiary.

  

### (h) _Litigation and Liabilities_. (i) Except as set forth in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and except for shareholder or
derivative litigation that may be brought relating to this Agreement or to
the transactions contemplated by or the events leading up to this Agreement,
there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective assets or any director, officer or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Person, in each case, for
whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to (i) prevent or
materially impair or delay the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any Governmental Entity specifically imposed upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which, would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to (i) prevent or materially impair or delay the ability
of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(i) _Employee Benefits_. (i) All material benefit and compensation
plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former
employees or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Employees_
") or current or former directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries under
which there is a continuing financial obligation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, employment, change
in control, severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans, agreements, programs,
policies or arrangements

        

sponsored, contributed to, entered into, or maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or for which the Company or its Subsidiaries could be reasonably
expected to have any present or future liability (whether or not material,
the " _Benefit Plans_ "), other than Benefit Plans maintained outside of the
United States primarily for the benefit of Employees working outside of the
United States (such plans hereinafter being referred to as "
_Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), are listed on Section 5.1(i)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and each Benefit Plan which has received a favorable
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office, has been
separately identified. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed
on Section 5.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter have been

meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and Non

substantial compliance with their respective terms and ERISA, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and other applicable Laws,
except for violations that, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each U.S.
Benefit Plan, which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification
of such ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA
in an amount which would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

#### (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is expected
to incur any material liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan",
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material
withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA
Affiliate).

   

21

be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any Benefit Plan.

  

#### (v) Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with another event) could reasonably be
expected to (A) entitle any executive officer or director to severance pay or
any material increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment
after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans or (C) result
in any payment or benefit that would not be deductible under Section 280G of
the Code.

  

#### (vi) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
their terms and applicable local Law. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, all contributions to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans required to be made by
the Company or its Subsidiaries through the Effective Time have been made or,
if applicable, shall be accrued in accordance with country specific
accounting practices.

  

### (j) _Takeover Statutes_. The board of directors of the Company has taken
all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set
forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not
applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each, including Section 203 of
the DGCL, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or any anti-takeover provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws is applicable to the
Company, the Shares, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Adverse Effect, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable
title to all real property owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries and good
title to all other properties owned by them, in each case, free and clear of
all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions
or encumbrances of any kind except such as do not affect the value of
such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made
of such property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) all of the
leases and subleases of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and under which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds properties listed in Section

leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the rights
of the Company or such Subsidiary to the continued possession of the leased
or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease.

pursuant to a ground lease, capital lease or operating lease.

  

### (iv) True and correct copies of those management agreements listed in
Section 5.1(k)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter have been made available
to Parent (excluding any amendments thereto). Section 5.1(k)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Letter describes the hotel that is the subject of each
such agreement. Each such agreement, as amended, is valid, binding and in
full force and effect as against the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
(and, to the knowledge of the Company, the other party thereto).

receivables.

Person that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company or
any its Subsidiaries.

is obtained, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request
therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Company also promptly makes such information
available to Parent and if the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms; it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the
making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal and provided that in the event
the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with any Person on terms
more favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to
Blackstone Real Estate Advisor VI L.P., the Company shall offer to amend the
Confidentiality Agreement to extend such more favorable terms to Blackstone
Real Estate Advisor VI L.P.; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) adopt, approve or recommend or propose
to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action
described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to take **** such action could reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors **** fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the
information then available and after consultation with the Companys legal
and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and, in connection with approving
or recommending such Superior Proposal, effects a Change in Recommendation
and authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the

        

### implementation of such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Company
shall not enter into any such agreement unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated by the Company in accordance with Section 8.3(a); and provided
further that, in the case of an unsolicited bona fide tender or exchange
offer the board of directors has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall not be required to authorize or enter into a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Proposal if it has complied with (A) and (B) above and the Person making such
Superior Proposal refuses to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
thereto.

  

### (c) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction or (ii) any other direct or indirect
acquisition, in each case in clauses (i) and (ii), involving 20% or more of
the total voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company, or
20% or more of the consolidated total revenues or consolidated assets
(including, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each
case whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
involving more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of
the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole that the board of directors of the Company has
determined in its good faith judgment, would, if consummated, result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement after
taking into account (x) any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent and any other information provided by Parent (including pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement), (y) the likelihood and timing of
consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby) and (z)
all material legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such proposal.

  

### (d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.2, the board of directors of
the Company shall not:

#### (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other

Proposal;

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained and other
than in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the board of directors of the
Company may effect a Change in Recommendation if the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so could reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. In
determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Proposal or otherwise, the board of directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement (including
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement) proposed by Parent and any
other information provided by Parent.

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the board of directors of the Company from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the

Company nor the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation, except as permitted by Section 6.2(b).

  

### (f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within
48 hours) notify Parent **** if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the parties and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including
any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement,
enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it
from providing such information to Parent.

  



   

40  

   

### (g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply
unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(a).

  

## 6.3. _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC
the preliminary proxy statement (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and in any event
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the Proxy Statement
with the SEC within 20 business days after the date of this Agreement. The
Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that, at the date of
mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations

Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to
be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in
proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other, to respond as promptly

Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance from
the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or the
Buyer Parties or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the

        

## Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and will include in such documents or responses all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent, and to the extent practicable, the Company
will provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in any substantive
calls between the Company, or any of its Representatives, and the SEC
concerning the Proxy Statement.

  

## 6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (including
any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as
promptly as practicable after the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to
Section 6.2, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend such
adoption and shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption of this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting shall not be affected by a Change
in Recommendation.

  

## 6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) _Cooperation_. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent

rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable.  Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5, shall

shall permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to participate
in any meeting or telephone conversations with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.  The Company shall notify Parent promptly of any effect,
event, development or change between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time which, to the Knowledge of the Company, causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section

any effect, event, development or change between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, which to the knowledge of Parent, causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 and 7.3 not to be satisfied.  The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.5(c) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

        

### (d) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this Section 6.5, each of the Company (in the case of Subsection

below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

  

#### (i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or

Approvals or Parent Approvals of non-privileged information and documents
requested by any such Governmental Entity or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

#### (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or
enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would materially
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale,
disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or
businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with,
and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving
effect thereto) if such action should be necessary or advisable to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)

any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would
materially delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger by any Governmental Entity; and

  

#### (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the
event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted,
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would

prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting
of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of
this Section 6.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,

shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
third party consents (i) identified and mutually agreed by the parties after

from occurring prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the Company
shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and the Buyer Parties and their respective businesses resulting, or
which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts

(B) would violate any applicable Law; or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Representatives

accruals under any defined benefit pension plan).

  

### (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any
successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge in accordance with their
terms any employment related contracts, agreements, arrangements and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that

### employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their predecessors; _provided_ that this shall not prevent

under the Company Benefit Plan which were previously held by the Company.

  

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" within the meaning of each Company Benefit Plan listed in Section

(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with coverage of not less than the
coverage under, and with such other terms that are at least as favorable in
the aggregate to, the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual
or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in

(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the premium payable for such insurance

_however_ ,

        

### that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for 2007
for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

  

### (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.11.

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

### (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or similar
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable
employment or indemnification agreement or Laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
similar organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect
as of the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

  

## 6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall, consistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors, promptly grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise promptly act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

## 6.13. _Parent Vote_. Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or
cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and
any shares of common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any
of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to
provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this

        

## Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub,
respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at
all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action
of stockholders of either the Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a
meeting).

  

## 6.14. _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the

  _that_ Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt
Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms would not
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions within its control applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, and (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments or on
other terms no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent). In the event that all
conditions to the Financing Commitments have been satisfied in Parents good
faith judgment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders providing the Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing required to consummate the Merger. Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required or
expressly permitted under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result
in termination of, any of the Financing Commitments. If any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing
Commitments, of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, or any termination
of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing.

  

### (b) Subject to applicable Laws, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers,
employees and advisors, including legal, tax and accounting, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation
reasonably requested in writing by Parent in

        

### connection with arrangement of the Financing, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assist Parent and
its financing sources with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the Financing, (iii) furnish Parent
and Merger Sub and their financing sources with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
(iv) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and its
financing sources for any Financing to be raised by Parent to complete the
Merger, (v) provide and execute documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, (vi) form new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (vii) transfer or
otherwise restructure its ownership of existing Subsidiaries, Properties or
other assets effective as of or immediately prior to and conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time, (viii) without limiting its obligations
under Section 4.5, cooperate in connection with the repayment or defeasance
of any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time, including delivering such payoff, defeasance or similar
notices under any existing mortgage or mezzanine loans of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent, and (ix) permit Parent
and its Representatives to conduct appraisal and environmental and
engineering inspections of each real estate property owned and, subject to
obtaining required third party consents (which the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ( _provided,_ _however,_ that (A) neither Parent nor its
Representatives shall have the right to take and analyze any samples of any
environmental media (including soil, groundwater, surface water, air or
sediment) or any building material or to perform any invasive testing
procedure on any such property, (B) Parent shall schedule and coordinate all
inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least three
(3) business days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection
or materials that Parent or its Representatives intend to conduct, and (C)
the Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times
during any such inspection); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or
give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time.  Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation and indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising therefrom.

  

### (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b)
above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality

## 9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an
original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the
same agreement.

  

## 9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.  (a) THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE
LAW ARE APPLICABLE), WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF
CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR
PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The parties
consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and any
courts from which appeals from judgments of that court are heard) as to any
dispute or claim as to which there is subject matter jurisdiction in that
court and, for all other disputes or claims, any state or federal court
located in Delaware (and any courts from which appeals from judgments of that
court are heard). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
(subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on

        

the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any Delaware State or Federal court in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 9.5(a). Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
9.6 (Notices).  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

  

### (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.5.

the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 25, 2007, between Blackstone Real
Estate Advisor VI L.P. and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
constitute the entire

        

agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT
FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

  

## 9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time
occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto.  Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

## 9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_.  Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

        

## 9.10. _Remedies_

  

(a) The Company agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages
in connection with this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of
Parent and Merger Sub for such loss or damages shall be limited to an amount
equal to the Parent Termination Fee and Company Expenses and any amounts owed
to the Company pursuant to Section 4.5(d), Section 6.1(d), Section 6.14(b)
and Section 8.5(d), (ii) the maximum liability of the Guarantors, directly or
indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations of the Guarantors
under the Guarantee, (iii) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any
money damages in excess of such amount from the other parties or the
Guarantors and (iv) in no event shall any of the respective former, current,
or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Guarantors, have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer
Parties or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such
breach shall be the remedy set forth in Section 8.5(c) and Section 9.10(a);
provided, that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub of Section
6.6(b) or Section 6.14(c).

  

## 9.11. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation when due.

  

## 9.12. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  

## 9.13. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such

        

invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  

## 9.14. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and
headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

  

### (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

### (c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of
information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed
by this Agreement.

  

## 9.15. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of
the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.
