are no Contracts that are material to the business, properties, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of
Monaker. Monaker is not in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is
a party or to which it or any of its properties or assets is subject, except
for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect of Monaker.

Section 5.12 _SEC Reports_.

  



  

(a) Monaker has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act (the "SEC Reports").

  



  

(b) As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports and any registration
statements filed by Monaker under the Securities Act (the "Registration
Statements") complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and none of the SEC Reports or
Registration Statements, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All material
Contracts to which Monaker is a party or to which the property or assets of
Monaker are subject have been filed as exhibits to the SEC Reports and the
Registration Statements as and to the extent required under the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as applicable. The financial statements of Monaker
included in the SEC Reports and the Registration Statements comply in all
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing, were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the
case of unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q), and fairly present
in all material respects (subject in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring audit adjustments) the financial position of Monaker as at
the dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended. The disclosure set forth in the SEC Reports and
Registration Statements regarding Monaker's business is current and complete
and accurately reflects operations of Monaker as it exists as of the date
hereof. There is no order issued by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of
any outstanding Registration Statement and there are no proceedings for that
purpose that have been initiated or threatened by the SEC.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Internal Accounting Controls_. Monaker maintains a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
general or specific authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset
accountability; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; and (d) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Monaker has established disclosure controls and procedures for Monaker and
designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to Monaker is made known to the officers by others
within Monaker. Monaker's officers have evaluated the effectiveness of
Monaker's controls and procedures. Since Monaker's Most Recent Fiscal Year
End, there have been no significant changes in Monaker's internal controls
or, to the Knowledge of Monaker, in other factors that could significantly
affect Monaker's internal controls.

Principal Market or any other trading market on which the Monaker Common Stock
is currently listed or quoted. The issuance and sale of the Restricted
Monaker Shares under this Agreement, assuming the approval of Monaker's
stockholders for the issuance of such Monaker Shares at the Stockholders'

trading market on which the Monaker Common Stock is currently listed or

the Monaker Common Stock.

  



  

Section 5.16 _Application of Takeover Protections_. Monaker has taken
all necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control
share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any
distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-
takeover provision under the Monaker Organizational Documents or the Laws of
its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Returns required to be filed (if any) by or on behalf of Monaker and such
subsidiary and have paid all Taxes of such entity required to have been paid
(whether or not reflected on any Tax Return). No Governmental Authority in
any jurisdiction has made a claim, assertion or threat to Monaker or any of
its subsidiaries that Monaker or such subsidiary is or may be subject to
taxation by such jurisdiction; there are no Liens with respect to Taxes on
Monaker's or any of its subsidiaries' property or assets; and there are no Tax

behalf of Monaker (i) has executed or entered into a closing agreement
pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision thereof or

are a party to any Contract or arrangement for services that would result,

Monaker nor any its subsidiaries are a "consenting corporation" within the
meaning of Section 341(f) of the Code. Neither Monaker nor any its
subsidiaries have any "tax-exempt bond financed property" or "tax-exempt use
property" within the meaning of Section 168(g) or (h), respectively of the

her duties as a director, officer or employee of Monaker; or (ii) the ability

Section 7.9 _HotPlay Acquisition of Majority Control of HP Thailand;
BOI Application_.

  



  

(a) The Parties acknowledge that due to legislation in Thailand that
restricts foreign investment, the lawful acquisition of the HP
Thailand Shares by HotPlay is conditioned upon the grant of a Foreign
Business Certificate by MOC, that the grant of a Foreign Business Certificate
is subject to the discretion of the MOC officials who review the application,
and that the bureaucratic process to obtain the Foreign Business Certificate
requires approximately nine to twelve months. Accordingly, until such time as
a Foreign Business Certificate may be issued to HP Thailand and HotPlay may
be lawfully allowed to acquire ninety nine and eight tenths per cent (99.8%)
of the HP Thailand Shares, the Parties shall, upon the execution of this
Agreement, proceed as follows:

  



  

(b) Prior to the HP Thailand Deadline, (i) HotPlay shall acquire 49% of
the issued and outstanding shares of Class A stock of HP Thailand; and (ii)
HP Thailand's organizational documents shall be lawfully amended, and such
other necessary transactions shall be undertaken by HP Thailand (including
where necessary, designating preferred stock), HotPlay, the Stockholders, and
their representatives, with the result that after such transactions, HotPlay
shall hold the HotPlay Preference Interest, and will therefore
effectively 'control' HP Thailand.

   



  

(c) Notwithstanding the above section (b), HotPlay and the
Stockholders shall take such actions which are necessary for HP Thailand to
file an application to the BOI for the grant of Investment Promotion, which
shall entitle HP Thailand to certain benefits and privileges, including ninety
nine and eight tenths per cent (99.8%) foreign ownership if applicable
(subject to further permission being granted by the MOC pursuant to a Foreign
Business Certificate), of HP Thailand by Monaker following the Closing and HP
Thailand shall file an application to the MOC for the issuance of a
Foreign Business Certificate, which shall grant formal recognition of
Monaker's indirect ownership interest in HP Thailand following the Closing,
in accordance with local legislation in Thailand regarding foreign investment.

Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement. HotPlay shall deliver to
Monaker a true, accurate and complete copies of the full HotPlay Disclosure
Schedule as required pursuant to the introductory paragraph of Article VI
above within ten (10) days of the date of this Agreement (the "Subsequently

following such delivery, Monaker shall provide HotPlay and the Stockholders
with written notice (the "Initial Disclosure Objection Notice") of any
concerns or objections to any matters disclosed in the Subsequently Delivered
HotPlay Disclosure Schedule, including anything which (A) has, or could

HotPlay or HP Thailand, (B) results in any representation, warranty or
covenant made herein by HotPlay or the Stockholders being materially
incorrect or misleading at the time it was made, (C) departs materially, from
any written or oral disclosures relating to HotPlay, HP Thailand or the
Stockholders (or their financial statements, liabilities, agreements,
litigation, assets, operations or prospects) which has been provided by
HotPlay or the Stockholders, or their representatives, to Monaker or its
representatives, prior to the date of this Agreement, or (D) materially
affects the ability of HotPlay or the Stockholders to complete the
transactions contemplated herein. Upon receipt of an Initial Disclosure
Objection Notice, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve those
matters raised in the Initial Disclosure Objection Notice, including
amendments to this Agreement as agreed to and to the extent warranted and
deemed necessary by Monaker. If, after good faith negotiations, the Parties
are unable to resolve those matters raised in the Initial Disclosure
Objection Notice no later than twenty (20) days from the Initial Disclosure
Objection Notice (the "Disclosure Schedule Cure Period"), this Agreement may
be terminated by Monaker as set forth in _Section 10.1(g)_  hereof. If
Monaker does not provide an Initial Disclosure Objection Notice within five
(5) Business Days of the receipt of the Subsequently Delivered HotPlay
Disclosure Schedule, Monaker will be deemed to have waived any objection to
that specific matter disclosed in the Subsequently Delivered HotPlay
Disclosure Schedule, unless such disclosure is discovered or uncovered later
to be false or misleading in any material respect, effective as of such date.

inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the

indemnification, payment of damages, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

Section 11.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Monaker shall
indemnify and hold harmless the HotPlay Indemnified Parties, from and against
any all costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, "Damages") arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with: (i) any breach (or alleged breach) of any representation or
warranty made by Monaker in this Agreement or any Transaction Document or in
any certificate delivered by Monaker pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any
breach (or alleged breach) by Monaker of any covenant or obligation of
Monaker in this Agreement or any Transaction Document required to be performed
by Monaker on or prior to the Closing Date or by Monaker after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(b) From and after the execution of this Agreement, HotPlay and the
Stockholders, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Monaker Indemnified Parties, from and against any all Damages
arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with: (i) any breach
(or alleged breach) of any representation or warranty made by HotPlay or the
Stockholders in this Agreement or any Transaction Document or in any
certificate delivered by HotPlay or the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement; or (ii) any breach (or alleged breach) by HotPlay or the
Stockholders of any covenant or obligation of HotPlay or the Stockholders in
this Agreement or any Transaction Document required to be performed by
HotPlay or Stockholder on or prior to the Closing Date or by HotPlay or the
Stockholders after the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 11.3 _Matters Involving Third Parties_. Promptly after the
assertion of any claim by a third party or occurrence of any event which
may give rise to a claim for indemnification from an indemnifying party
("Indemnifying Party") under this Article XI, an indemnified party
("Indemnified Party") shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such claim.
The Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the control and defense of any
such action (including, but without limitation, tax audits), provided that
the Indemnitee may participate in the defense of such action subject to the
Indemnitor\'s reasonable direction and at Indemnitee's sole cost and expense.
The party contesting any such claim shall be furnished all reasonable
assistance in connection therewith by the other party and be given full
access to all information relevant thereto. In no event shall any such claim
be settled without the Indemnitor's consent.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the indemnification provisions in this Article XI shall be the
exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than for fraud and willful misconduct.

ARTICLE XII. 
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 12.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party will bear its respective expenses incurred in connection
with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses
of agents, representatives, counsel, and accountants. In the event of
termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each Party to pay its own
expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party arising from a breach of
this Agreement by another Party.

  



  

Section 12.2 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) The Parties will maintain in confidence, and will cause their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors to maintain
in confidence, any written, oral, or other information obtained in confidence
from another Person in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless (i) such information is already known
to such Party or to others not bound by a duty of confidentiality or such
information becomes publicly available through no fault of such Party; (ii)
the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any required
filing with the SEC, or obtaining any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) the
furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or
appropriate in connection with legal proceedings.

  



  

(b) In the event that any Party is required to disclose any
information of another Person pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of Section
12.2(a) above, the Party requested or required to make the disclosure (the
"disclosing party") shall provide the Person that provided such information
(the "providing party") with prompt notice of any such requirement so that
the providing party may seek a protective Order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 12.2. If, in the
absence of a protective Order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by
the providing party, the disclosing party is nonetheless, in the opinion of
counsel, legally compelled to disclose the information of the providing
party, the disclosing party may, without liability hereunder, disclose only
that portion of the providing party's information which such counsel advises
is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the disclosing party
exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
providing party's information, including, without limitation, by cooperating
with the providing party to obtain an appropriate protective Order or other
relief assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the providing
party's information.

  



  

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, each Party will return or destroy all of such
written information each party has regarding the other Parties, subject to
customary backup and related procedures relating to such information.

applicable party or Parties at the address specified below, subject to notice
of changes thereof from any party with at least ten (10) business

Section 12.5 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Parties are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by
any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement
or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no claim
or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
Parties; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.6 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties with respect to its
subject matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this
Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may
not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the Party against
whom the enforcement of such amendment is sought, provided that Section 8.3
may only be amended after the Closing as set forth in _Section 8.3_.

  



  

Section 12.7 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights_. No
Party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior
consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties. Except as set forth in Article XI hereof, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

  



  

Section 12.9 _Section Headings_. The headings of Articles and Sections
in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Article" or "Articles" or
"Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Article or Articles or
Section or Sections of this Agreement, unless the context indicates
otherwise.

Section 12.10 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word
"including" shall mean including without limitation. The Parties intend that
each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of such representation, warranty, or covenant. All words
used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as
the circumstances require.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by
facsimile transmission, electronic delivery, or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation
of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile, electronic copy, or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of
the Parties agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the U.S. or any state thereof having
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the provisions
set forth in Section 12.13 below), in addition to any other remedy to which
they may be entitled, at Law or in equity.

  



  

Section 12.13 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Florida, without regard to conflicts of Laws principles. Each of
the Parties submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in Broward County, Florida, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each
of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Any
Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 12.3. Nothing in this Section
12.13, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law or at equity.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

expressly represents and warrants to all other Parties hereto that (a) before
executing this Agreement, said Party has fully informed itself of the terms,
contents, conditions and effects of this Agreement; (b) said Party has relied
solely and completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; (c)
