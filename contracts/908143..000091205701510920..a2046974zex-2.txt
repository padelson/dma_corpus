iv    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated
as of April 19, 2001 (this "Agreement"), by and between MidCity Financial
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MidCity"), and MB Financial, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("MB").   W I T N E S S E T H :   WHEREAS, MidCity
and MB desire to combine their respective holding companies through a tax-
free, stock-for-stock merger transaction so that the respective stockholders
of MidCity and MB will have continued equity ownership of the combined
holding company;   WHEREAS, neither the Board of Directors of MidCity nor
the Board of Directors of MB seeks to sell its respective holding company at
this time but both Boards desire to merge their respective holding companies
in a transaction structured as a merger of equals;   WHEREAS, to accomplish
this result, (i) MB and MidCity will form a new Delaware corporation named
MB-MidCity Inc. ("NewCo"), (ii) MB will, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, merge with and into NewCo (the "MB Merger") and (iii)
MidCity will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge
with and into NewCo (the "MidCity Merger" and together with the MB Merger,
the "Mergers"), in each case so that NewCo is the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Mergers;   WHEREAS, at the time of, or as
soon as reasonably practicable following, consummation of the Mergers, it is
intended that the financial institution subsidiaries of the parties that are
domiciled in Illinois shall be merged into one entity;   WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of the parties to enter into this
Agreement, MidCity and each of the directors of MB identified on Exhibit A-1,
and MB and each of the directors of MidCity identified on Exhibit B-1, are
entering into voting agreements in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits A-2
and B-2, respectively, with respect to the shares set forth opposite such
director\'s name on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit B-1, as the case may be;  
WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that the Mergers be accounted for
as a "pooling of interests" under generally accepted accounting
principles and constitute reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties agree as follows:     ARTICLE I  THE MERGERS AND SUBSIDIARY
MERGERS   Section 1.1 Organization of NewCo. MB and MidCity shall form NewCo
under the laws of the State of Delaware. MB and MidCity shall each own one-
half of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of NewCo. The Certificate
of Incorporation and the By-laws of NewCo shall be in the forms of Exhibits C
and D, respectively, but the Certificate of Incorporation of NewCo shall be
amended to change the name of NewCo as provided in SECTION 1.3 below.  
Section 1.2 THE MERGERS. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the MB Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),

in the MB Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws
of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the MB Merger, the separate
corporate existence of MB shall terminate.   (b) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in  accordance with the DGCL, at the MidCity
Effective Time (as hereinafter  defined), MidCity shall merge with and into
NewCo. NewCo shall be the  Surviving Corporation in the MidCity Merger, and
shall continue its  corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Upon  consummation of the MidCity Merger, the separate corporate
existence of  MidCity shall terminate.   (c) MB and MidCity may at any time
change the method of effecting  the combination of MidCity and MB with NewCo
or with each other including  without limitation the provisions of this
ARTICLE I, if and to the extent  they deem such change to be desirable,
including, without limitation, to  provide for a merger of either party with
and into a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the other; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such change shall (i)  alter or change the form or the amount of
consideration to be provided to  holders of MB Common Stock (as defined
below) as provided for in this  Agreement (the "MB Merger Consideration"),
(ii) adversely affect the tax  treatment to MB stockholders as a result of
receiving the MB Merger  Consideration, (iii) alter or change the form or the
amount of  consideration to be provided to holders of MidCity Common Stock
(as  defined below) as provided for in this Agreement (the "MidCity Merger 
Consideration"), (iv) adversely affect the tax treatment to MidCity 
stockholders as a result of receiving the MidCity Merger Consideration or 
(v) materially impede or delay consummation of the Mergers and the other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME.

State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") with respect to the
MB Merger. The MB Certificate of Merger shall amend the Certificate of
Incorporation of NewCo to change its name to "MB Financial, Inc." The MidCity
Merger shall become effective (the "MidCity Effective Time" and together with
the MB Effective Time, the "Effective Time") at the time the certificate of
merger (the "MidCity Certificate of Merger") is filed with (or in the case of
a pre-filing, is accepted for    -2-   filing by) the Delaware Secretary

and the MidCity Certificate of Merger to be filed on the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) with the Delaware Secretary or pre-filed prior thereto
for acceptance for filing by the Delaware Secretary on the Closing Date.  
Section 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS. At and after the Effective Time,
the Mergers shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the
DGCL.   Section 1.5 CONVERSION OF MB COMMON STOCK. By virtue of the MB
Merger and without any action on the part of NewCo, MB, MidCity or any holder
of MB Common Stock:   (a) Subject to SECTIONS 1.5(d), at the MB Effective
Time, each share  of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of MB (the
"MB Common  Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MB
Effective Time  except for, (i) shares of MB Common Stock owned, directly or
indirectly,  by MB or MidCity or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries  (other than shares of MB Common Stock held, directly or
indirectly, in  trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a  fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties

the case  may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account MB Shares") and
(ii)  shares of MB Common Stock held on account of a debt previously
contracted  ("DPC MB Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive
one (1)  share (the "MB Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $.01
per  share, of NewCo ("NewCo Common Stock").   (b) At the MB Effective
Time, all of the shares of MB Common Stock  shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and  shall cease to exist as of the MB
Effective Time, and each certificate  (each an "MB Certificate") previously
representing any such shares of MB  Common Stock (other than shares cancelled
pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c))  shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive a certificate  representing the number of shares of NewCo Common
Stock which the shares  of MB Common Stock represented by such MB Certificate
have been converted  based upon the MB Exchange Ratio pursuant to this
SECTION 1.5.   (c) At the MB Effective Time, all shares of MB Common Stock
that are  owned, directly or indirectly, by MB or MidCity or any of their
respective  wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account MB Shares and
DPC MB  Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
NewCo  or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  
(d) In the event MB or MidCity changes (or establishes a record date  for
changing) the number of shares of MB Common Stock or MidCity Common  Stock,
whichever is applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the MB  Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,  recapitalization or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding MB  Common Stock or
MidCity Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be  after the date
hereof and prior to the MB Effective Time, the MB Exchange  Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted.    -3-    Section 1.6 CONVERSION OF MIDCITY
COMMON STOCK. By virtue of the MidCity Merger and without any action on the
part of NewCo, MidCity, MB or any holder of MidCity Common Stock:   (a)
Subject to SECTIONS 1.6(d) AND (e), at the MidCity Effective  Time, each

"MidCity Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the
MidCity Effective Time except for (i) MidCity Dissenting  Shares, (ii) shares
of MidCity Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly,  by MidCity or MB or
any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries  (other than shares of
MidCity Common Stock held, directly or indirectly,  in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a  fiduciary capacity,
that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such  shares, whether held
directly or indirectly by MidCity or MB, as the case  may be, being referred
to herein as "Trust Account MidCity Shares") and  (iii) shares of MidCity
Common Stock held on account of a debt previously  contracted ("DPC MidCity
Shares")) shall be converted into the right to  receive 230.32955 shares (the
"MidCity Exchange Ratio") of NewCo Common  Stock.   (b) At the MidCity
Effective Time, all of the shares of MidCity  Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be  canceled and shall cease to exist as
of the MidCity Effective Time, and  each certificate (each a "MidCity
Certificate") previously representing  any such shares of MidCity Common
Stock (other than MidCity Dissenting  Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to
SECTION 1.6(c)) shall thereafter  represent only the right to receive (i) a
certificate representing the  number of whole shares of NewCo Common Stock
and (ii) cash in lieu of any  fractional share interest which the shares of
MidCity Common Stock  represented by such MidCity Certificate have been
converted based upon the  MidCity Exchange Ratio pursuant to this SECTION
1.6. The MB Certificates  and the MidCity Certificate are collectively
referred to herein as the  "Certificates."   (c) At the MidCity Effective
Time, all shares of MidCity Common  Stock that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by MidCity or MB or any of  their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account  MidCity Shares and DPC MidCity
Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease  to exist and no stock of NewCo or
other consideration shall be delivered  in exchange therefor.   (d) In the
event MidCity or MB changes (or establishes a record date  for changing) the
number of shares of MidCity Common Stock or MB Common  Stock, whichever is
applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the  MidCity Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, stock dividend,  recapitalization or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding  MidCity Common Stock or MB
Common Stock and the record date therefor shall  be after the date hereof and
prior to the MidCity Effective Time, the  MidCity Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted.   (e) No fractional shares of NewCo Common Stock
and no certificates  or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership
thereof, will be issued  in the MidCity Merger; instead, NewCo shall pay to
each holder of MidCity  Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional share of  NewCo Common Stock (after taking into account all
MidCity Certificates  delivered by such holder) an amount in cash
(without    -4-    interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by
the average closing  sale price of MB Common Stock on the National Market
System of the Nasdaq  Stock Market, Inc. (the "Nasdaq") (as reported in THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL  or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative
source), for the  five trading days immediately preceding the MidCity
Effective Time.   (f) Any shares of MidCity Common Stock ("MidCity
Dissenting Shares")  whose holder becomes entitled to the fair value of such
shares under the  DGCL shall not be entitled to receive the MidCity Merger
Consideration and  shall be entitled to payment for such shares only to the
extent permitted  by and in accordance with the DGCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if any holder  of MidCity Dissenting Shares shall forfeit such right to
payment, such  shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have  become exchangeable for, as of the MidCity Effective Time, the
right to  receive the MidCity Merger Consideration from the Surviving
Corporation  without interest. MidCity Dissenting Shares shall not, after the
MidCity  Effective Time, be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any 
dividends or other distributions and shall be entitled only to such rights 
as are afforded in respect of MidCity Dissenting Shares pursuant to the 
DGCL.   Section 1.7 NEWCO CAPITAL STOCK. The shares of capital stock of
NewCo owned by MB and MidCity immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be automatically canceled at the Effective Time.   Section 1.8 CERTIFICATE

of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.   Section 1.9 BY-
LAWS. At the Effective Time, the By-laws of NewCo shall be the By-laws of the

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as to each of the

Mergers shall be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" under generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").   Section 1.11 MANAGEMENT. At the

specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of NewCo
Common Stock into which the shares of MB Common Stock or MidCity

have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and in the case of a holder
of MidCity Certificate(s), a check representing the amount of any cash in

holder thereof shall be  entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any  interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to  shares of NewCo Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.   (c) If any certificate representing shares of NewCo Common
Stock is  to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
or  Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall
be  a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or
Certificates  so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an  appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for 
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the 
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation in advance any transfer or  other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate  representing
shares of NewCo Common Stock in any name other than that of  the registered
holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or  required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of  the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been  paid or is not
payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the  stock transfer books of MB or MidCity of shares of MB Common Stock or 
MidCity Common Stock, respectively, that were issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, 
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the 
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for  certificates
representing shares of NewCo Common Stock (and in the case of  a holder of
MidCity Certificate(s), for cash in lieu of any fractional  share interest,
if applicable) as provided in ARTICLE I.   (e) Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the  stockholders of MB and MidCity for 12
months after the Effective Time  shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.
Any former stockholders of MB  or MidCity who have not theretofore complied
with this ARTICLE II shall  thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the MB  Merger Consideration or MidCity Merger Consideration,
whichever is  applicable, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or  any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of MB  Common Stock or MidCity Common Stock for any amount delivered
in good  faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property,  escheat or similar laws.    -8-    (f) In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or  destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person  claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting  by such person of a bond in such amount
as the Surviving Corporation or  the Exchange Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity  against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving Corporation or  the Exchange Agent with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent or  the Surviving Corporation will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or  destroyed Certificate the shares of NewCo
Common Stock and any cash in  lieu of a fractional share interest deliverable
in respect thereof  pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 2.3 MB STOCK
OPTIONS; RESERVATION OF NEWCO COMMON STOCK AND SECURITIES FILINGS. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option outstanding on the date of this Agreement and
each option awarded after the date hereof in accordance with Section
5.2(b)(iii) of this Agreement to purchase shares of MB Common Stock (each, an
"MB Stock Option") under the Coal City Corporation 1995 Stock Option Plan, MB
(Avondale Financial Corporation) 1995 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and MB
1997 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "MB Stock Plans") and remaining outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation and each such MB Stock Option shall
continue to be outstanding, but shall represent an option to purchase shares
of NewCo Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as
provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the applicable MB Stock
Plan and MB Stock Option):   (i) the number of shares of NewCo Common Stock
to be subject  to the continuing MB Stock Option shall be equal to the
product of  the number of shares of MB Common Stock subject to the MB Stock 
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the MB Exchange  Ratio,
provided that any fractional share of NewCo Common Stock  resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the  nearest whole share; and  
(ii) the exercise price per share of NewCo Common Stock under  the continuing
MB Stock Option shall be equal to the exercise price  per share of MB Common
Stock under the MB Stock Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time
divided by the MB Exchange Ratio,  provided that such exercise price shall be
rounded down to the  nearest cent.   It is intended that the foregoing
assumption shall be undertaken  consistent with and in a manner that will not
constitute a "modification"  under Section 424 of the Code as to any MB Stock
Option which is an  "incentive stock option".   (b) At all times after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation  shall reserve for issuance such
number of shares of NewCo Common Stock as  is necessary to permit the
exercise of continuing MB Stock Options in the  manner contemplated by this
Agreement and the instruments pursuant to  which such options were granted.
The Surviving Corporation shall make all  filings required under federal and
state securities laws promptly after  the Effective Time so as to permit the
exercise of such continuing MB  Stock Options and the sale of the shares
received by optionees upon such  exercise at and after the Effective Time and
the Surviving Corporation  shall continue to make such    -9-   
filings thereafter as may be necessary to permit the continued exercise of 
continuing MB Stock Options and sale of such shares.   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MIDCITY   Except as disclosed in the
MidCity disclosure schedule delivered to MB concurrently herewith (the
"MidCity Disclosure Schedule"), MidCity hereby represents and warrants to MB
as follows:   Section 3.1 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION. (a) MidCity is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. MidCity has the corporate power and authority
to own and lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on MidCity.
As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with
respect to MB, MidCity or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results
of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (x) to the extent that
they do not, in any case, disproportionately affect MB, MidCity or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, changes in thrift, banking and
similar laws of general applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or
Governmental Entities or other changes affecting depository institutions
generally, including changes in general economic conditions and changes in
prevailing interest and deposit rates or (y) actions or omissions of MidCity
or MB taken with the prior written consent of the other party in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means
any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. MidCity is
duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). Copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, (the "MidCity Charter") and By-laws of MidCity, as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by MidCity to MB.   (b) Each of MidCity\'s Subsidiaries (i) is
duly organized and validly  existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly  licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in all  jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its  ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires  it to be so qualified except where the failure to be so licensed
or  qualified would not either individually or in the aggregate have a 
Material Adverse Effect on MidCity and (iii) has all requisite corporate 
power and authority to own and lease its properties and assets and to  carry
on its business as now conducted. Copies of the charters and by-laws  of
MidCity\'s financial institution Subsidiaries, as in effect on the date  of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by MidCity to MB.   
-10-    Section 3.2 CAPITALIZATION. (a) The authorized capital stock of
MidCity consists of 100,000 shares of MidCity Common Stock, of which, as of
the date hereof, 46,007 shares were issued and outstanding. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of MidCity Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.
MidCity does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of MidCity Common Stock or any
other equity securities of MidCity or any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of MidCity Common Stock. As of
the date hereof, no shares of MidCity Common Stock were reserved for
issuance. Since December 31, 2000, MidCity has not issued any shares of
MidCity Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable for
any shares of MidCity Common Stock. In no event will the aggregate number of
shares of MidCity Common Stock outstanding at the MidCity Effective Time
exceed 46,007.   (b) MidCity owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and  outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of  each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges,  encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all
of such  shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
validly  issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (subject to 12 U.S.C.
Section55)  and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the  ownership thereof. None of MidCity\'s Subsidiaries has or
is bound by any  outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or  agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any  shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or  any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any  shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.  Section 3.2(b) of the MidCity Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of the  material investments of MidCity in Non-Subsidiary Affiliates. As
used in  this Agreement, the term "Non-Subsidiary Affiliate" when used with
respect  to any party means any corporation, partnership, limited liability 
company, joint venture or other entity other than such party\'s 
Subsidiaries.   Section 3.3 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION. (a) MidCity has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of

affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
MidCity Common Stock with respect to the consummation of the MidCity Merger
only. The Board of Directors of MidCity has directed that this Agreement be
submitted to MidCity\'s stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such
stockholders. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by MidCity and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by MB)
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of MidCity, enforceable against
MidCity in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).

Agreement  nor the consummation by MidCity or any of its financial

documents of  any of its financial institution Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming
that the  consents and approvals referred to in SECTION 3.4 are duly

right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance 
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the 
respective properties or assets of MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries  under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,  mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other  instrument or
obligation to which MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries is a  party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets  may be bound or
affected except for such violations, conflicts, breaches  or defaults which,
either individually or in the aggregate, will not have  a Material Adverse
Effect on MidCity.   Section 3.4 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Except for (i) the

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") under

of KPMG, LLP, independent public accountants with respect to MidCity. The
December 31, 2000 consolidated balance sheet of MidCity (including the
related notes, where applicable) fairly presents in all material respects the

contemplated  herein, since December 31, 2000, MidCity and its Subsidiaries
have carried  on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary  course.   (c) Since December 31, 2000, neither MidCity nor any of
its  Subsidiaries has (i) except for such actions as are in the ordinary
course  of business or except as required by applicable law, (A) increased
the  wages, salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe benefits or 
perquisites payable to any executive officer, employee, or director from  the

suffered any strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or other labor  disturbance
which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, either  individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MidCity.   Section 3.9
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. (a) Neither MidCity nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of MidCity\'s knowledge,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions or investigations of any nature against MidCity or any of its
Subsidiaries as to which, in any such case, there is (i) a request for
monetary relief in excess of $25,000, (ii) an assertion or allegation
of employment discrimination or sexual harassment, (iii) a request for
specific performance or other equitable relief, or (iv) a challenge to the
validity or propriety of the MidCity Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) There is no injunction, order,
judgment, decree, or regulatory  restriction (other than those that apply to
similarly situated bank  holding companies or banks) imposed upon MidCity,
any of its Subsidiaries  or the assets of MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries
that could either  materially adversely affect the ability of MidCity or any
of its  Subsidiaries to operate its business in the regular and ordinary
course  consistent with past practices or materially adversely affect the 
consolidated operating results or financial condition of MidCity.   Section
3.10 Taxes and Tax Returns. (a) Each of MidCity and its Subsidiaries has duly
filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and tax
returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof (all such
returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly
paid or made adequate provisions for the payment of all Taxes and other
governmental charges which have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due
from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities
(including, without limitation, if and to the extent applicable, those due in
respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock, deposits,
franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than (i) Taxes or other
charges which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith and
have not been finally determined, or (ii) information returns, tax returns,
Taxes or other governmental charges as to which the failure to file, pay or
make provision are , in the aggregate, not material to MidCity on a
consolidated basis. The federal income tax returns of MidCity and its
Subsidiaries have either been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") or the statute of limitation for examination by the IRS has expired
for all years to and including the taxable year ended December 31, 1996 and
any    -14-   liability with respect thereto has been satisfied or any
liability with respect to deficiencies asserted as a result of such
examination is covered by adequate reserves. To the best of MidCity\'s
knowledge, there are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted for,
Taxes or assessments upon MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries for which
MidCity does not have adequate reserves. Each of MidCity and its Subsidiaries
has (A) withheld proper and accurate amounts from payments to employees,
creditors, independent contractors, foreign persons and other third parties
for all prior periods in compliance in all material respects with the tax
withholding provisions of applicable federal, state and local laws, (B) filed
all federal, state, and local returns (which are accurate and complete in all
material respects) for all periods for which returns were due with respect to
income tax withholding, Social Security and unemployment taxes and (C)
paid or made adequate provision for all Taxes shown on such federal, state or
local returns to be due and payable. There are no Tax liens upon any property
or assets of MidCity or its Subsidiaries except liens for current taxes not
yet due. Neither MidCity nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to
include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by
reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by MidCity or any
of its Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting method.   (b) As used in this Agreement,
the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means all  federal, state, local, and foreign
income, excise, gross receipts, gross  income, ad valorem, profits, gains,
property, capital, sales, transfer,  use, payroll, employment, severance,
withholding, duties, intangibles,  franchise, backup withholding, and other
taxes, charges, levies or like  assessments together with all penalties and
additions to tax and interest  thereon.   (c) Neither MidCity nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any  agreement or maintains any compensation
plan, program or arrangement under  which any payment is reasonably likely to
become non-deductible, in whole  or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a
result of the limitations  under Section 162(m) of the Code and the
regulations issued thereunder.   (d) Neither MidCity nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is  bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or  arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement solely among  MidCity and its Subsidiaries). Neither MidCity nor
any of its Subsidiaries  has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other
than MidCity and its  Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar  provision of state, local or foreign law). Within
the past five years,  neither MidCity nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
party to a  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code or
been a  "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution  intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.  
Section 3.11 EMPLOYEES. (a) Section 3.11(a) of the MidCity
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each employee or director benefit
plan, arrangement or agreement (a "MidCity Benefit Plan") that, as of the
date of this Agreement, is maintained or contributed to by MidCity or any
MidCity ERISA Affiliate, or under which MidCity or any MidCity ERISA
Affiliate could reasonably be expected to have any liability as of the date
of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement a "MidCity ERISA Affiliate"
is any corporation, partnership or other trade or business that, together
with MidCity, would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the   
-15-   meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA").   (b) MidCity has heretofore made
available to MB copies of each  MidCity Benefit Plan and certain related
documents, including (i) the  actuarial report for the MidCity Benefit Plan
(if applicable) for each of  the last two years and (ii) the most recent
determination letter from the  IRS (if applicable) for the MidCity Benefit
Plan.   (c)(i) Each of the MidCity Benefit Plans has been operated and 
administered in all material respects in compliance with applicable laws, 
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, (ii) each of the  MidCity
Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of  Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified, and there are no existing  circumstances
or any events that have occurred that will adversely affect  the qualified
status of that MidCity Benefit Plan, (iii) the present value  of accrued
benefits under each MidCity Benefit Plan that is subject to  Title IV of
ERISA did not, as of the plan\'s most recent valuation date and  based upon
the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most  recent
actuarial report prepared by the plan\'s actuary, exceed the then  current
value of the assets of the plan allocable to accrued benefits,  (iv) no
MidCity Benefit Plan provides benefits, including, without  limitation, death
or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with  respect to current or
former employees or directors of MidCity or its  Subsidiaries beyond their
retirement or other termination of service,  other than (A) coverage mandated
by applicable law, (B) death benefits or  retirement benefits under an
"employee pension plan" (as defined in  Section 3(2) of ERISA), (C) deferred
compensation benefits accrued as  liabilities on the books of MidCity or its
Subsidiaries or (D) benefits  the full cost of which is borne by the current
or former employee or  director (or his beneficiary), (v) no material
liability under Title IV of  ERISA has been incurred by MidCity, its
Subsidiaries or any MidCity ERISA  Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists  that presents a material risk to MidCity, its
Subsidiaries or any MidCity  ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material
liability thereunder, (vi) no  MidCity Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer
pension plan" (as defined in  Section 3(37) of ERISA), (vii) all
contributions or other amounts payable  by MidCity or its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time with respect to  each MidCity Benefit Plan in respect of
current or prior plan years have  been paid or accrued in accordance with
GAAP and Section 412 of the Code,  (viii) none of MidCity, its Subsidiaries,
the MidCity ERISA Affiliates or  any other person, including any fiduciary,
has engaged in a transaction in  connection with which MidCity, its
Subsidiaries, any MidCity ERISA  Affiliate or any MidCity Benefit Plan will
be subject to either a material  civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section
409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a  material tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code, and  (ix) to the best knowledge of MidCity there are no
pending, threatened or  anticipated material claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) by,  on behalf of or against, any of the MidCity Benefit
Plans or any trusts  related thereto.   (d) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the  consummation of the MidCity Merger or any
other transaction contemplated  by this Agreement will (i) directly or
indirectly (including without  limitation, as a result of any termination of
employment or service at any  time prior to or following the Effective   
-16-    Time), entitle any current or former employee, director or
independent  contractor of MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries to any actual
or deemed  payment (or benefit) which would constitute a "parachute payment"
(as such  term is defined in Section 280G of the Code), without regard to
whether  such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services
performed or  to be performed in the future, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise  payable under any MidCity Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
acceleration  of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any
MidCity  Benefit Plan.   Section 3.12 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. (a)
MidCity and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all
material respects with and are not in default in any material respect under,
any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline
of any Governmental Entity relating to MidCity or any of its Subsidiaries,
except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or
authorization or such noncompliance or default will not, either individually
or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the ability of MidCity or
any of its Subsidiaries to operate its business in the regular and ordinary
course consistent with past practices or materially adversely affect the
consolidated operating results or financial condition of MidCity.   (b)
MidCity and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material  respects properly
administered all accounts for which it acts as a  fiduciary, including

and effect. MidCity and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all
material respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent

operate  its business in the regular and ordinary course consistent with
past  practices or adversely affect the consolidated operating results or 
financial condition of MB.   Section 4.10 TAXES AND TAX RETURNS. (a) Each of
MB and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local
information returns and tax returns required to be filed by it on or prior to
the date hereof (all such returns being accurate and complete in all material
respects) and has duly paid or made adequate provisions for the payment of
all Taxes and other governmental charges which have been incurred or are due
or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing
authorities (including, without limitation, if and to the extent applicable,
those due in respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock,
deposits, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than (i) Taxes or
other charges which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good
faith and have not been finally determined, or (ii) information returns, tax
returns, Taxes or other governmental charges as to which the failure to file,
pay or make provision are, in the aggregate, not material to MB on a
consolidated basis. The federal income tax returns of MidCity and its

including the taxable year ended December 31, 1996 and any liability with
respect thereto has been satisfied or any liability with respect to
deficiencies asserted as a result of such examination is covered by
adequate reserves. To the best of MB\'s knowledge, there are no material
disputes    -25-   pending, or claims asserted for, Taxes or assessments
upon MB or any of its Subsidiaries for which MB does not have adequate
reserves. Each of MB and its Subsidiaries has (A) withheld proper and
accurate amounts from payments to employees, creditors, independent
contractors, foreign persons and other third parties for all prior periods in
compliance in all material respects with the tax withholding provisions of
applicable federal, state and local laws, (B) filed all federal, state, and
local returns (which are accurate and complete in all material respects) for
all periods for which returns were due with respect to income tax
withholding, Social Security and unemployment taxes and (C) paid or made
adequate provision for all Taxes shown on such federal, state or
local returns to be due and payable. There are no Tax liens upon any property
or assets of MB or its Subsidiaries except liens for current taxes not yet
due. Neither MB nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to include in
income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason of a
voluntary change in accounting method initiated by MB or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment
or change in accounting method.   (b) Neither MB nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any  agreement or maintains any compensation plan,
program or arrangement under  which any payment is reasonably likely to
become non-deductible, in whole  or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a
result of the limitations  under Section 162(m) of the Code and the
regulations issued thereunder.   (c) Neither MB nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or is bound  by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement  (other than such an agreement or arrangement solely

any liability  for the Taxes of any person (other than MB and its
Subsidiaries) under  Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state,  local or foreign law). Within the past five years,
neither MB nor any of  its Subsidiaries has been a party to a reorganization

Plan") that, as of the date of this Agreement, is maintained or contributed
to by MB or any MB ERISA Affiliate, or under which MB or any MB ERISA
Affiliate could reasonably be expected to have any liability as of the date
of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement an "MB ERISA Affiliate" is
any corporation, partnership or other trade or business that, together with

last two  years and (ii) the most recent determination letter from the IRS
(if  applicable) for the MB Benefit Plan.   (c)(i) Each of the MB Benefit
Plans has been operated and  administered in all material respects in
compliance with applicable laws,  including, but not limited to, ERISA and
the Code, (ii) each of the MB  Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified"
within    -26-    the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified, and there are  no existing circumstances or any events that have
occurred that will  adversely affect the qualified status of that MB Benefit
Plan, (iii) the  present value of accrued benefits under each MB Benefit Plan
that is  subject to Title IV of ERISA did not, as of the plan\'s most
recent  valuation date and based upon the actuarial assumptions used for
funding  purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by the
plan\'s  actuary, exceed the then current value of the assets of the plan
allocable  to accrued benefits, (iv) no MB Benefit Plan provides benefits,
including,  without limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not
insured),  with respect to current or former employees or directors of MB or
its  Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service, 
other than (A) coverage mandated by applicable law, (B) death benefits or 
retirement benefits under an "employee pension plan" (as defined in  Section
3(2) of ERISA), (C) deferred compensation benefits accrued as  liabilities on
the books of MB or its Subsidiaries or (D) benefits the  full cost of which
is borne by the current or former employee or director  (or his beneficiary),
(v) no material liability under Title IV of ERISA  has been incurred by MB,
its Subsidiaries or any MB ERISA Affiliate that  has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a  material risk to MB, its
Subsidiaries or any MB ERISA Affiliate of  incurring a material liability
thereunder, (vi) no MB Benefit Plan is a  "multiemployer pension plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (vii)  all contributions or other amounts
payable by MB or its Subsidiaries as of  the Effective Time with respect to
each MB Benefit Plan in respect of  current or prior plan years have been
paid or accrued in accordance with  GAAP and Section 412 of the Code, (viii)
none of MB, its Subsidiaries, the  MB ERISA Affiliates or any other person,
including any fiduciary, has  engaged in a transaction in connection with
which MB, its Subsidiaries,  any MB ERISA Affiliate or any MB Benefit Plan
will be subject to either a  material civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA  or a material tax imposed pursuant to Section
4975 or 4976 of the Code,  and (ix) to the best knowledge of MB there are no
pending, threatened or  anticipated material claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) by,  on behalf of or against, any of the MB Benefit
Plans or any trusts related  thereto.   (d) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the  consummation of the MB Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by  this Agreement will (i) directly or
indirectly (including without  limitation, as a result of any termination of
employment or service at any  time prior to or following the Effective Time),
entitle any current or  former employee, director or independent contractor
of MB or any of its  Subsidiaries to any actual or deemed payment (or
benefit) which would  constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G  of the Code), without regard to whether such payment
is reasonable  compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the  future, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any MB Benefit  Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting  of any benefits under any MB Benefit Plan.   Section
4.12 SEC REPORTS. MB has previously made available to MidCity an accurate and
complete copy of each (a) final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January 1, 1998 by MB
(the "MB Reports") with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act and prior to the date
hereof and (b) communication mailed by MB to its stockholders since   
-27-   January 1, 1998 and prior to the date hereof, and no such MB Report
or communication, as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date hereof) shall be deemed
to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 1998, as of
their respective dates, all MB Reports filed under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.   Section 4.13 COMPLIANCE WITH
APPLICABLE LAW. (a) MB and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have
complied in all material respects with and are not in default in any material
respect under, any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to MB or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise,
permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default will not, either
individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the ability of
MB or any of its Subsidiaries to operate its business in the regular
and ordinary course consistent with past practices or materially adversely
affect the consolidated operating results or financial condition of MB.  
(b) MB and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects  properly
administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary,  including
accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,  personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in  accordance
with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and  federal law
and regulation and common law. None of MB, any of its  Subsidiaries, or any
director, officer or employee of MB or of any of its  Subsidiaries, has
committed any breach of trust with respect to any such  fiduciary account
that will or is likely to result in a material liability  to MB or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the accountings for each such  fiduciary account are true
and correct in all material respects and  accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account.   Section 4.14 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a) Neither MB nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the
employment of any directors, officers or employees, (ii) which, upon the
consummation or stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or
events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
becoming due from MidCity, MB, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any current or former director, officer, employee
or independent contractor of MB or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) which is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement, (iv) which
restricts the conduct of business by MB or any of its Subsidiaries or upon
consummation of the MB Merger will restrict the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any business, (v) with or
to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement),
(vi) with respect to which (including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan)
any of the benefits will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits will
be accelerated, by the occurrence of any stockholder approval or the
consummation of any of the    -28-   transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits will be calculated on the
basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (vii)
which cannot be terminated upon 30 days notice without penalty or premium and
which involves either an annual payment obligation in excess of $25,000 or
aggregate payments in excess of $100,000 by MB or one of its Subsidiaries
(but specifically excluding deposit liabilities). Section 4.14(a) of the MB
Disclosure Schedule lists each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this SECTION 4.14(a), and each of them
is referred to herein as an "MB Contract."   (b)(i) Each MB Contract is
valid and binding on MB or one of its  Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in
full force and effect, (ii) MB or its  applicable Subsidiary has performed
all material obligations required to  be performed by it under each MB
Contract, and (iii) no event or condition  exists which constitutes or, after
notice or lapse of time or both, will  constitute, a material default on the
part of MB or any of its  Subsidiaries under any MB Contract.   (c) Neither
MB nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received  notice of, any
material violation of or default under any MB Contract by  any of the other
parties thereto.   Section 4.15 REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) Neither MB nor any
of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued
by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum
of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been since January 1, 1998, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or
since January 1, 1998, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of
any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts
in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management
or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the MB Disclosure
Schedule, a "MB Regulatory Agreement"), nor has MB or any of its Subsidiaries
been advised since January 1, 1998, by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any such MB
Regulatory Agreement.   (b) Except for normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Agency  in the ordinary course of the business of MB and its
Subsidiaries, no  Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of MB,  investigation into the business or operations of MB or any
of its  Subsidiaries since January 1, 1998. All material violations,
criticisms,  and exceptions by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any
report or  statement relating to any examinations of MB or any of its
Subsidiaries  have been resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of such
Regulatory  Agency.   (c) Each MB financial institution Subsidiary has a
Community  Reinvestment Act rating of "satisfactory" or better.   Section
4.16 INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All interest rate swaps,
caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk management
arrangements, whether entered into for the account of MB or for the account
of a customer of MB or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in
the ordinary course of business and, to MB\'s knowledge, in   
-29-   accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules,
regulations and policies of any applicable Regulatory Agency and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of MB or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and are in full force and effect. MB and each of its Subsidiaries
have duly performed in all material respects all of their material
obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued; and, to MB\'s knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations
or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.  
Section 4.17 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except for (i) liabilities that

practices to be reflected in an audited financial statement or the notes
thereto.   Section 4.18 INSURANCE. MB and its Subsidiaries are insured for
reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies
against such risks as companies or institutions engaged in similar businesses
would, in accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured and
have maintained all insurance required by their agreements and applicable
laws and regulations. Neither MB nor any of its Subsidiaries has, during the
past five years, had an insurance policy canceled or not renewed or been
denied any insurance coverage for which it has applied. Section 4.18 of the
MB Disclosure Schedule lists all self-insurance plans or programs maintained
by MB and its Subsidiaries. Copies of such plans and programs have been
provided to MidCity.   Section 4.19 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) Neither the
conduct nor operation of business by MB or any of its Subsidiaries nor any
condition of any property currently or previously owned, operated or
controlled by any of them (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or
agency capacity), or to the knowledge of MB, on which any of them holds a
Lien, has or is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to MB
or any of its Subsidiaries under or by reason of any Environmental Law or by
the presence of any Materials of Environmental Concern. To the knowledge of
MB, no condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of
them or any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both,
has or is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to MB or any
of its Subsidiaries under or by reason of any Environmental Laws or the
presence of Materials of Environmental Concern. Except for notices for which
there is no reasonable basis for the imposition of a material liability or
remediation obligation on the part of MB or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern, neither
MB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice from any person that
MB or its Subsidiaries or the operation or condition    -30-   of any
property ever owned, operated, controlled, or held as collateral or in
a fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in violation of or otherwise
are alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or relating to
Materials of Environmental Concern, including, but not limited to,
responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property.   (b) There are no underground storage
tanks located on, in or under  any real property currently owned, operated or

property leased by it.   Section 4.20 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. The Board of
Directors of MB has approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for purposes of Section 203(a)(1) of the DGCL such that the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.21 MATERIAL INTERESTS OF
CERTAIN PERSONS. No officer, director or employee of MB or any of its
Subsidiaries or any "associate" (as such term is defined in Rule 14a-1 under
the Exchange Act) of any officer, director or employee of MB or any of its
Subsidiaries has any material interest in any material agreement or property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible) used in, or pertaining to, the
business of MB or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.22 REAL ESTATE LOANS
AND INVESTMENTS. Except for properties acquired in settlement of loans, there
are no facts, circumstances or contingencies known to MB which exist and
would require a material reduction under GAAP in the present carrying value
of any of the real estate investments, joint ventures, construction loans,
other investments or other loans of MB or any of its Subsidiaries (either
individually or in the aggregate with other loans and investments).  
Section 4.23 FAIRNESS OPINION. On the date of this Agreement,
Sandler O\'Neill and Partners, L.P. has provided to the Board of Directors of
MB an oral fairness opinion (which shall be confirmed in writing) to the
effect that the MB Exchange Ratio, after taking into account the MidCity
Exchange Ratio, is fair to the stockholders of MB from a financial point of
view.   Section 4.24 REORGANIZATION; POOLING OF INTERESTS. As of the date of

a "pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.   Section 4.25 FINANCIAL
HOLDING COMPANY STATUS. As of the date of this Agreement, MB meets all
applicable criteria to become and remain a "financial holding company", as

promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and  authorizations
of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are  necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement
(including, without limitation, the Mergers), and to comply with  the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and  authorizations
of all such Governmental Entities. MidCity and MB shall  have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each  will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws  relating to the exchange
of information, all the information relating to  MB or MidCity, as the case
may be, and any of their respective  Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing
made with, or written materials  submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the  foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as  promptly as practicable. The parties hereto
agree that they will consult  with each other with respect to the obtaining
of all permits, consents,  approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental  Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised  of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions  contemplated herein.   (c) MidCity and MB shall, upon
request, furnish each other with all  information concerning themselves,
their Subsidiaries, directors, officers  and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or  advisable in connection with the
Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any  other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of  NewCo, MidCity, MB or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any  Governmental Entity in connection with the
Mergers and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
MidCity and MB  agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information  supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by  reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment
or  supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, 
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the 
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and  any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the 
stockholders of the parties and at the time of each stockholders\' meeting, 
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the 
statements therein not misleading or any statement which, in the light of 
the circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false or 
misleading with respect to any material fact, or which will omit to state 
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not 
false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier 
statement in the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement 
thereto. Each of MidCity and MB further agrees, if it shall become aware 
prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by it that would 
cause any of the statements in the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or 
misleading with respect to any material fact or the omission of any  material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or  misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the  necessary steps to
correct the Joint Proxy Statement.    -36-    (d) MB agrees to cause
NewCo to advise MidCity, promptly after NewCo  receives notice thereof, of
the time when the S-4 has become effective or  any supplement or amendment
has been filed, of the issuance of any stop  order or the suspension of the
qualification of NewCo Common Stock for  offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any  proceeding for any such
purpose or of any request by the SEC for the  amendment or supplement of the
S-4 or for additional information.   (e) MidCity and MB shall promptly
advise each other upon receiving  any communication from any Governmental
Entity whose consent or approval  is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable  likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval (as defined below) will  not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such approval will be  materially delayed.   Section 6.2 ACCESS TO
INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of MidCity and MB, for the
purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and
preparing for the Mergers and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of
MidCity and MB shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which MidCity or MB, as
the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such party may reasonably request. Neither MidCity nor MB nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of MidCity\'s or MB\'s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.   (b) Each of MB and MidCity agrees that it will not, and
will cause  its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant
to this  SECTION 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the
date  hereof in connection with entering into this Agreement) for any
purpose  unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep 
confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all 
information and documents obtained pursuant to this SECTION 6.2 (as well  as
any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection  with
the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was  already
known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from  other sources
not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality  obligation, (iii)
is disclosed with the prior written approval of the  providing party or
(iv)    -37-    is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly
available sources. If  this Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each
party shall  promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof
containing  information and data as to the other party to be returned to the
other  party.   (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective  representatives shall affect the representations and warranties
of the  other set forth herein.   Section 6.3 STOCKHOLDERS\' APPROVALS.
Each of MidCity and MB shall call a meeting of its stockholders to be held as
soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of MidCity shall favorably recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the MidCity stockholders and the Board of
Directors of MB shall favorably recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
MB stockholders, and each such Board shall take all other reasonable and
lawful action to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals; PROVIDED
HOWEVER, if the Board of Directors of MB or MidCity concludes that the making
of (or continuing to make) a favorable recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of such party under Delaware
law (as determined in good faith), then the Board of Directors of such party
may withdraw, modify or change such recommendation.   Section 6.4 LEGAL
CONDITIONS TO MERGERS. Subject to the fiduciary duty provisions contained in
SECTIONS 5.2(g) AND 6.3, each of MidCity and MB shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Mergers and, subject to the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by MB or MidCity or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.5 AFFILIATES; PUBLICATION OF
COMBINED FINANCIAL RESULTS. (a) Each of MidCity and MB shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person
who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and
for purposes of qualifying the Mergers for "pooling of interests" accounting
treatment) of such party to deliver to the other party hereto, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the
stockholders\' meetings called by MidCity and MB to approve this Agreement, a
written agreement, in the form of EXHIBIT E OR F, as applicable, hereto,
providing that such person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any shares of MidCity Common Stock, or MB Capital Stock held by
such "affiliate" and any shares of NewCo Common Stock to be received by such
"affiliate" in the Mergers.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall use its
commercially reasonable  efforts to publish as promptly as reasonably
practical, but in no event  later than 90 days after the end of the first
month after the MB Effective  Time in which there are at least 30 days of
post-Mergers combined  operations (which month may be the month in which
the    -38-    Effective Time occurs), combined sales and net income
data as contemplated  by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting
Series Release No.  135.   Section 6.6 STOCK QUOTATION. NewCo shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of NewCo Common Stock to

otherwise mutually determined, the MB Benefit Plans and MidCity Benefit Plans
in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect
with respect to employees of MB or MidCity (or their Subsidiaries),
respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time until such time as
the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to applicable law, the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of such plans, adopt new benefit plans with respect
to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "New
Benefit Plans"), or otherwise merge or combine existing MidCity Benefit Plans
into MB Benefit Plans, or vice versa. Prior to the Closing Date, MB and
MidCity shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the MidCity
Benefit Plans and MB Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate
New Benefit Plans or combining or merging existing benefit plans for the
employees covered thereby.   (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Surviving Corporation shall  honor in accordance with their terms all
benefits vested as of the  Effective Time under the MidCity Benefit Plans or
the MB Benefit Plans or  under other contracts, arrangements, commitments, or
understandings  described in the MidCity Disclosure Schedule and the MB
Disclosure  Schedule.   (c) Nothing in this SECTION 6.7 shall be
interpreted as preventing  the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying
or terminating any  MidCity Benefit Plans, MB Benefit Plans, or other
contracts, arrangements,  commitments or understandings, in accordance with
their terms and  applicable law.   (d) It is the intention of MB and
MidCity, during the period shortly  following the execution of this
Agreement, to coordinate efforts towards  establishing a retention and
severance program, consistent with the  strategy for the Mergers, in an
effort to retain and provide incentives to  key personnel for the benefit of
the Surviving Corporation and its  wholly-owned Subsidiaries in a manner that
provides for equitable  treatment of similarly situated employees of MB,
MidCity and their  respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries.   (e) In the event
that any employee of MidCity who is covered by a  MidCity Change in Control
Severance Agreement or the MidCity Severance  Plan as of the date hereof (as
disclosed in SECTION 3.13(a) of the MidCity  Disclosure Schedule) is
involuntarily terminated without cause at the  Effective Time or within 24
months thereafter, then notwithstanding that  the Mergers may not constitute
a change in control under such employee\'s  MidCity Change in Control
Severance Agreement or the MidCity Severance  Plan, the covered MidCity
employee shall nevertheless be entitled to the  applicable benefit under his
or her MidCity Change in Control Severance  Agreement or the MidCity
Severance Plan, whichever is applicable. The  provisions of this SECTION
6.7(e) shall survive the Effective Time and are  intended to be for the
benefit of, and    -39-    shall be enforceable by, each such employee
of MidCity and his or her  heirs and representatives.   (f) Prior to the
Closing Date, MB and/or its wholly-owned  Subsidiaries may enter into Change
in Control Severance Agreements with  senior vice presidents (or persons with
equivalent responsibilities) or a  Change in Control Severance Plan for their
benefit providing up to one  year\'s salary for each covered employee if he
or she is involuntarily  terminated without cause in connection with or
within 24 months after a  change in control, including the change in control
arising from the  Mergers.   Section 6.8 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND
OFFICERS\' INSURANCE. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,

administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of NewCo, MB, MidCity or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of NewCo, MB, MidCity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.  
(b) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause  NewCo to
continue the existing officers and directors liability insurance  of MB as of
the Effective Time with coverage for the past acts and  omissions of
individuals serving as officers and directors of MB, MidCity  and their
respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,  and if such
past acts and omissions coverage is available, the Surviving  Corporation
shall continue such coverage for the 6 year period next  following the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, MidCity and/or  MB, at the
election of MB, shall procure 6 year tail coverage under its  existing
policies of officers\' and directors\' liability insurance for the  past acts
and omissions of individuals serving as officers and directors  of such party
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time in lieu of  any obligation
of the Surviving Corporation to provide any officers and  directors liability
insurance coverage for past acts and omissions.   (c) In the event the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors  or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall  not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such  consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or    -40-    conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any  person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper  provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the  Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this SECTION  6.8.   (d) The provisions of this SECTION 6.8 shall survive
the Effective  Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable  by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.   Section 6.9 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
merger between a Subsidiary of MB, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of
MidCity, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of MB
or MidCity, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 6.10 ADVICE OF CHANGES. MidCity and MB shall each

agreements contained herein.   Section 6.11 REDEMPTION OF COMMON STOCK BY

shall redeem or otherwise acquire a number of shares of outstanding MB Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of MB Common Stock issued pursuant to the
exercise of such MB Rights; provided no such action shall be taken by MB at
any time that such action would adversely affect the ability of (i) the
Mergers to qualify as a "pooling of interests" under GAAP or (ii) either of
the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. MB
shall also have the right to accept outstanding shares of MB Common Stock in
payment of the exercise price of MB Rights.   Section 6.12 NEWCO AS AN
ADDITIONAL PARTY. Upon the organization of NewCo, MB and MidCity shall cause
