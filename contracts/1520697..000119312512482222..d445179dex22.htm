ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE; PURCHASE PRICE

2.1 Purchase and Sale of the AmiCare Units. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Sellers shall sell, transfer,
assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept from
Sellers, legal and beneficial ownership of all of the AmiCare Units owned by
Sellers, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

2.2 Purchase Price.

 

(a) The purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") for the AmiCare Units shall
be equal to:

 

(i) One Hundred Thirteen Million Dollars ($113,000,000.00);

 

(ii) plus the Cash and Cash Equivalents; and

 

(iii) plus the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital Target, or minus the amount (if any) by which the
Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

(iv) The Purchase Price shall be payable to 2C4K and ARTC proportionately
based on their respective Units owned as set forth on _Schedule 4.4_.

(b) The Purchase Price, minus the Escrow Amount, shall be paid at Closing to
Sellers in accordance with _Section 3.2_. The Purchase Price is subject to
adjustment as provided in  _Section 2.3_. At Closing, Buyer shall deliver
the Escrow Amount to Escrow Agent to be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement (herein so called) in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit 2.2(b)_. Within five (5) days after March 31, 2014 (the " _Escrow
Release Date_ "), Sellers shall be entitled to receive all of the

 



10  remaining Escrow Amount, plus any interest thereon, less a reasonable
estimate of potential Losses relating to claims pursuant to _Article XI_ for
which a valid Claim Notice has been submitted by Buyer in accordance with
_Section 11.3_ (each an " _Unresolved Claim_ "). From time to time promptly
after final resolution of any Unresolved Claim, Sellers and Buyer will
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Sellers or Buyer, as appropriate,
amounts held by the Escrow Agent in respect of such Unresolved Claim. At such
date after the Escrow Release Date as no Unresolved Claims exist, Buyer and
Sellers will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse all remaining
Escrowed Funds to Sellers. The expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers (" _Sellers
Escrow Expense_ "). The Sellers Escrow Expense shall be deducted from any
portion of the Escrow Amount that is payable to Sellers and retained by the
Escrow Agent prior to the distribution of the balance, if any, to Sellers.

2.3 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) The Purchase Price is based, in part, on the Group Companies having an
aggregate Working Capital of One Million Two Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($1,226,000.00) at the Closing (the " _Working Capital Target_
"). Accordingly, the Purchase Price is subject to adjustment pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3_ (the " _Purchase Price
Adjustments_ ") if, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate Working Capital of
the Group Companies is greater or less than the Working Capital Target.
_Exhibit 2.3(a)_ sets forth an example calculation of the Group Companies
Working Capital that illustrates how the Group Companies Working Capital
shall be calculated for the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer their good faith estimate of (i) the Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") as of immediately prior
to the Closing, (ii) the Cash and Cash Equivalents, and (iii) the
Closing Indebtedness, all in reasonable detail prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

(c) As promptly as practicable (but not later than thirty (30) calendar days)
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall:

(i) prepare a consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the
Closing Date, reflecting Buyers good faith estimate of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), which
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (A) be prepared on the same
basis and applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices that
were used in preparing the Estimated Closing Working Capital, including the
principles, policies and practices set forth on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_ , and (B)
fairly present Buyers good faith estimate of the value of the consolidated
assets and liabilities of the Group Companies as of the Closing Date; and

 

(ii) deliver to Sellers the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the
Working

 



11  Capital of the Group Companies as of the Closing Date, which calculation
shall (A) exclude accruals in accordance with GAAP in respect of liabilities
to be incurred by the Group Companies on or after the Effective Time and (B)
be prepared on the same basis and applying the same accounting principles,
policies and practices that were used in preparing the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, including the principles, policies and practices set forth
on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_ (the " _Preliminary Working Capital Determination_ ").

(d) Sellers may, within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of receipt of
the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Preliminary Working Capital
Determination, deliver to Buyer a written statement setting forth their
objections thereto. In the event Sellers do not so object within such thirty
(30) day period, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Preliminary
Working Capital Determination shall be final and binding as the " _Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ " and " _Closing Working Capital_ ", respectively, for
purposes of this Agreement. In the event Sellers so object within such thirty
(30) day period, Buyer and Sellers shall use their reasonable efforts to
resolve, in good-faith, by written agreement (the " _Agreed Adjustments_ ")
any differences as to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and
Preliminary Working Capital Determination and, in the event Sellers and Buyer
so resolve any such differences, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
and Preliminary Working Capital Determination, in each case as adjusted by the
Agreed Adjustments, shall be final and binding as the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and Closing Working Capital, respectively, for purposes of this
Agreement. In the event any objections raised by Sellers are not resolved by
Agreed Adjustments within thirty (30) calendar days after Sellers advise Buyer
of Sellers objections, then Buyer and Sellers shall submit the objections
that are then unresolved to and jointly engage the Nashville, Tennessee office
of Lattimore, Black, Morgan and Cain, P.C. (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall
be directed by Buyer and Sellers to resolve the unresolved objections as
promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Accounting Firms appointment, and to deliver written
notice to each of Buyer and Sellers setting forth its resolution of the
disputed matters. The Accounting Firm may only review the items that are in
dispute. The Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute applying the same
accounting principles, policies and practices that were used in preparing the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, including the principles, policies and
practices set forth on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_. In connection with the resolution of
such dispute, the Accounting Firm will allow Buyer and Sellers to present
their respective positions regarding each item that is in dispute, with
concurrent copies to the other. The Accounting Firm may, in its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the dispute, at which conference Buyer and
Sellers may present additional documents, materials and other information and
have present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants. The
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Preliminary Working Capital
Determination, in each case after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments and
to the resolution of disputed matters by the Accounting Firm, shall be final
and binding as the "Closing Date Balance Sheet" and "Closing Working Capital",
respectively, for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Party may assert that any award issued by
the Accounting Firm is unenforceable because it has not been timely rendered.

 

(e) The Parties shall make available to Buyer and Sellers and, if applicable,
the Accounting Firm, such books, records and other information (including
work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably request in order to review
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet, the Estimated Closing Working Capital and Preliminary Working Capital
Determination, respectively, or any matters submitted to the Accounting Firm.
Buyer and Sellers shall bear the fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm
in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items
submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by each such
Party bears to the total dollar amount of such disputed items so submitted (as
determined by the Accounting Firm in its sole discretion); provided that,
until such determination is made, the fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the one hand,
and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers, on the other, with the Parties reimbursing
one another, if necessary, following such determination. All other costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties hereto in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party
incurring such cost and expense. 

 



12 2.4 Net Working Capital Adjustment Payment.

 

(a) If the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working
Capital (such excess, the " _Working Capital Excess_ "), Buyer shall, within
five (5) Business Days of such determination, pay to Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds a dollar amount equal to such excess; or

actually performed in the ordinary course of business.

5.17 Employee Benefits. 

(a) Set forth on _Schedule 5.17(a)_ is a true, complete and correct list of
all "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, all
benefit plans as defined in Section 6039D of the Code and all other bonus,
incentive compensation,

 



27  deferred compensation, profit sharing, stock option, severance, supplemental
unemployment, layoff, salary continuation, retirement, pension, health, life
insurance, disability, group insurance, vacation, holiday, sick leave, fringe
benefit or welfare plans or any other plans, agreements, policies or
understandings (whether oral or written, qualified or non-qualified),
including deferred compensation arrangements that are referenced in
an employment agreement, and any trust, escrow or other funding arrangements
related thereto (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"), (i) which are maintained
or contributed to, by any Group Company or ERISA Affiliate; or (ii)
with respect to which any Group Company or ERISA Affiliate has any expense,
liability or obligation to or with respect to any current or former officer,
director, employee, service provider or the dependents or beneficiaries
thereof, regardless of whether funded.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.17(b)_ , each Benefit Plan has
been established and administered in accordance with its terms and is in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except for
such matters or non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not constitute a Facilities Material Adverse Effect. There have been no
prohibited transactions or breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to the
Benefit Plans and related funding arrangements that would constitute a
Facilities Material Adverse Effect. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified, and each trust
established in connection with any Benefit Plan that is intended to be exempt
from federal Income Taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt.
All material contributions to, and material payments from, each Benefit Plan
that are required to be made in accordance with the terms and conditions
thereof and applicable Laws (including ERISA and the Code) have been timely
made in all material respects.

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(c)_ , neither Sellers nor any Group
Company or ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, been a participating employer
in, contributed to, or, since March 23, 2010, been liable to contribute to any
employee benefit plan, or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, prior to March
23, 2010 been liable to contribute to, any employee benefit plan which is or
was (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) subject to the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the
Group Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof has sponsored or contributed
to, or been required to contribute to, a multiemployer plan (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), any multiple employer plan within the meaning of
Section 4063 or Section 4064 of ERISA, or a multiple employer welfare
arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA).

(d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(d)_ , no Benefit Plan provides for,
and no written or oral agreements have been entered into with any employee or
former employee of any Group Company promising or guaranteeing, the
continuation of health or other welfare benefits for any former employee of
any Group Company for any period of time beyond the termination of employment
(except to the extent of health continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA).

(e) Sellers have made available to Buyer a correct and complete copy or
original of (i) each written Benefit Plan, including all amendments thereto,
and all related trust

 



28  documents; (ii) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and
accompanying schedules with respect to each Benefit Plan, as applicable; and
(iii) the most recent determination, opinion, notification or advisory letter
from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Benefit Plan, as
applicable.

(f) With respect to any Benefit Plan, as of the date of this Agreement (i) no
claims, lawsuits or actions (other than routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) are pending, or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened and (ii)
no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by
the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS or other Governmental Body is pending,
in progress or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened. Each of the Benefit Plans
and Group Companies have properly classified individuals providing services to
any Group Company as independent contractors or employees, as the case may be.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(g)_ , none of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance by any Party of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the transactions (alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following
the Closing Date) will (i) entitle any Acquired Employee to any compensation
or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding, of any compensation or benefit or trigger any other
material obligation under any Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, or default under, or limit any Group Companys right to amend,
modify or terminate any Benefit Plan.

(h) No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of the
transactions (alone or in conjunction with any other event) by any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with
respect to Sellers will constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of any Group Company is entitled to receive any gross-
up or additional payment by reason of the tax required by Sections 409A or
4999 of the Code being imposed on such person.

(i) Sellers and the Group Companies have complied in all material respects
with the continuation coverage provisions of COBRA and any applicable state
statutes mandating health insurance continuation coverage for the Acquired
Employees. _Schedule 5.17(i)_ contains a list of all current and former
employees performing services for the Group Companies and their beneficiaries
who are eligible for (and/or have elected continuation coverage under COBRA)
and who will be treated as "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

5.18 Labor Matters.

(a) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, with
respect to any employee of any Group Company, (i) any strike, slowdown,
picketing, work stoppage or employee grievance process, (ii) charge, grievance
proceeding or other claim against any Group Company relating to the alleged
violation of any Law pertaining to labor relations or employment matters,
including any charge or complaint filed by an

 



29  employee or union with the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any comparable Governmental Body, (iii)
union organizational activity or other labor or employment dispute against
any Group Company, or (iv) application for certification of a collective
bargaining agent.

(b) No Group Company is a party to, or bound by, any union contract,
collective bargaining agreement or other labor-related agreements or
arrangements with any labor union, labor organization or works council. No
union or similar organization represents employees of any Group Company and,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, as of the date hereof no such organization is
attempting to organize such employees.

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.18_ , the Group Companies are in
compliance with all applicable Laws relating to labor, labor relations or
employment, except for any such violation or non-compliance which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not constitute a Facilities Material
Adverse Effect. No Group Company has engaged in any location closing or
employee layoff activities during the two-year period prior to the date hereof
that would violate or in any way implicate the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar state or local Law
(collectively, "WARN Act"). _Schedule 5.18_ includes a complete list of all
employees terminated by any Group Company in the past ninety (90) days, which
list shall be updated by Sellers at Closing.

 

5.19 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.19_ :

 

(a) (i) the Group Companies are in compliance with Environmental Laws and hold
and are in compliance with all Governmental Permits required pursuant to
Environmental Laws; (ii) no Group Company has assumed, undertaken or otherwise
become subject to any liability or corrective, investigatory or remedial
obligation of any other Person relating to any Environmental Laws; (iii) no
Group Company has received in the past three (3) years any currently
unresolved written notice of any violation of any Environmental Laws; and (iv)
no Group Company has Released any Contaminant at, on, under or from any
property owned or leased by any Group Company in violation of any
Environmental Laws, except in each case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Facilities Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Neither Sellers nor any of the Group Companies has disposed of or Released
any Contaminant on the Owned Real Property or Leased Property so as to give
rise to any liabilities or investigatory, corrective or remedial obligations
under any Environmental Laws which would reasonably be expected to have a
Facilities Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Each of the Group Companies has all licenses, permits, registrations,
approvals and authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws in
connection with its operations of the Facilities (" _Environmental Permits_
"), all such Environmental Permits are in full force and effect and all
renewal applications due for such Environmental Permits have been timely
filed, and each Facility is in compliance with such Environmental Permits,
except for any such noncompliance as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Facilities Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) To Sellers Knowledge, Sellers have furnished to Buyer all written
environmental assessments, tests, analyses, reports and audits relating to
the Facilities, the Owned Real Property and the Leased Property that are in
its possession, including without limitation any prior Phase I or Phase II
environmental assessments of the Owned Real Property (the " _Environmental
Reports_ ").

 



30 5.20 Insurance. Set forth on _Schedule 5.20_ is a list of all policies of
fire, liability, workers compensation, property, casualty and other forms of
insurance covering the Group Companies as of the date of this Agreement. Such
policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due thereon have
been paid, and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received by
any Group Company with respect to any such policy. Sellers have made available
to Buyer correct and complete copies of all such policies, together with all
riders and amendments thereto.

5.21 Related Party Transactions. Other than arrangements between the Group
Companies and Sellers and except as set forth on _Schedule 5.21_ , (a) no
Related Party has, and no Related Party has had within the past three (3)
years, any interest in any material asset used in or otherwise relating to the
business of the Group Companies, (b) no Related Party is or has, within the
past three (3) years, been indebted to any Group Companies (other than for
ordinary travel advances) and none of the Company or Group Companies is or has
been indebted to any Related Party and (c) to Sellers Knowledge, no Related
Party has entered into, or has any financial interest in, any material
contract, transaction or business dealing with or involving any Group Company,
other than transactions or business dealings conducted in the ordinary course
of business at prevailing market prices and on prevailing market terms.

5.22 Brokers. Except for Stephens, Inc., neither any of the Group Companies
nor any Person acting on behalf of the Group Companies has paid or become
obligated to pay any fee or commission to any third party broker, finder or
intermediary for or on account of the Contemplated Transactions.

5.23 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties.

 

(a) NONE OF SELLERS, ANY GROUP COMPANY, ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF, NOR ANY OF
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES (FINANCIAL, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE), MAKES OR HAS MADE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER
RELATING TO SELLERS, THE GROUP COMPANIES OR ANY OF THEIR SUBSIDIARIES OR THE
BUSINESS OF THE GROUP COMPANIES OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLERS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE V. SELLERS HEREBY
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Sellers, any
Group Companies nor any Affiliate or Representative thereof has made, and
shall not be deemed

 



31  to have made, any representations or warranties in the materials relating to
the business of the Group Companies made available to Buyer, including due
diligence materials, or in any presentation of the business of the Group
Companies by management of Sellers or others in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, and no statement contained in any of such materials
or made in any such presentation shall be deemed a representation or warranty
hereunder or otherwise or deemed to be relied upon by Buyer in executing,
delivering and performing this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. It
is understood that any cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any
data, any future financial information or any memoranda or offering materials
or presentations, including but not limited to, any confidential information
memorandum or similar materials made available by Sellers, the Group Companies
or their Affiliates or Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties of Sellers, and are not and shall
not be deemed to be relied upon by Buyer in executing, delivering and
performing this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.

ARTICLE VI

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

the Contemplated Transactions, Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Sellers
as follows:

6.1 Organization. Buyer is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer
is duly licensed or qualified to conduct business as a foreign limited
liability company and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer or its
operations. Buyer has all necessary corporate power and authority to own or
lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business in the manner that
it has been and is currently conducted.

6.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreement. Buyer has all necessary
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and each of the Buyer Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party,
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
authorized by the governing board of Buyer and duly executed and delivered by
Buyer and is (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Sellers) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and each of the Buyer Ancillary
Agreements has been duly authorized by the governing board of Buyer and, upon
execution and delivery thereof by Buyer, will be duly executed and delivered
by Buyer, and will be (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery by each Seller, where such Seller is a party, or the other party or
parties thereto) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, in each case subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general application relating to
or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. No
other action on the part of Buyer or its members or managers is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is a party, the performance of Buyers
obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation by Buyer of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



32 6.3 No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals. The execution and delivery of,
and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement by Buyer do not,
and the consummation by Buyer of the Contemplated Transactions or by any of
the Buyer Ancillary Agreements will not:

 

(a) assuming the receipt of all necessary authorizations, consents, approvals,
orders and waivers and the filing of all necessary documents as described in
_Section 6.3(b)_, with or without the giving of notice, lapse of time or
both, conflict with, result in a violation or breach of the terms, conditions
or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event
creating rights of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of
rights under, (i) the Certificate of Formation, Operating Agreement or other
governing documents of Buyer, (ii) any contract to which Buyer is a party or
by which Buyer or any of its assets, properties or businesses may be subject
or bound, (iii) any Governmental Order to which Buyer is a party or by which
Buyer or any of its assets, properties or businesses may be subject or bound
or (iv) any material Laws or Governmental Permits applicable to Buyer or any
of its assets, properties or businesses, other than, in the case of clause
(ii) above, any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights or loss
of rights that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of Buyer to
enter into, perform its obligations under and consummate the Contemplated
Transactions; or

 

(b) require the authorization, consent, approval, order, waiver or act of, or
the making by Buyer of any declaration, filing or registration with or notice
to, any Person, except (i) in connection, or in compliance, with the
provisions of the HSR Act, and (ii) such authorizations, consents, approvals,
orders, waivers, acts of, declarations, filings, registrations or notices the
failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the
ability of Buyer to enter into, perform its obligations under and consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

6.4 Legal Proceedings.

 

(a) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the actual knowledge of Buyer,
threatened against Buyer or its Affiliates, or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, consultants or agents (in their capacity as
such), in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of Buyer
to enter into, perform its obligations under and consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

(b) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the actual knowledge of Buyer,
threatened against Buyer or its Affiliates that questions the legality of the
Contemplated Transactions, or which seeks to restrain, enjoin or delay the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or which seeks damages in
connection herewith or therewith, and no injunctions of any type have been
entered or issued in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(c) There are no Governmental Orders to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
or any of their respective assets, properties or businesses is subject or
bound, except for any Governmental Orders, which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Buyer to enter into, perform its obligations
under and consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer has no reasonable
basis to believe that any Governmental Orders or restrictions are contemplated
or that its current assets or activities make any such Governmental Orders
or restrictions reasonably likely to result as a result of the execution of
this Agreement or otherwise, prior to the Closing.

 



33 6.5 Financing. Buyer has cash on hand and other available sources of
funds that, together, will at the Closing be sufficient to effect the
Contemplated Transactions, including payment of the Purchase Price and other
amounts required to be paid under _Section 3.2_, pay all associated fees,
costs and expenses and to make all other payments required by the terms
hereof and to otherwise consummate the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that it shall not be a condition to the obligations of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby that Buyer have sufficient
funds for payment of all amounts due hereunder.

6.6 Investment Representations.

(a) Buyer is acquiring the AmiCare Units as an investment for its own account
and not with a view to the distribution thereof. Buyer shall not sell,
transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate any of the AmiCare Units in the
absence of registration under, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from,
federal and applicable state securities Laws.

(b) Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the AmiCare
Units and to understand the risks of, and other considerations relating to,
its purchase of the AmiCare Units.

 

(c) Buyer is aware that, as of the Closing Date, (i) the AmiCare Units will
not have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any
states securities Laws, and (ii) no securities issued by either Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

6.7 No Brokers. Neither Buyer nor any Person acting on its behalf has paid or
become obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or
intermediary for or on account of the Contemplated Transactions.

The respective Parties covenant that, during the period from and after the

7.1 Access to Information. Sellers agree to provide Buyer with reasonable
access to all information in the possession of Sellers or Representatives
relating to the Group Companies or the Contemplated Transactions, and all of
such information shall be treated as Confidential Information pursuant to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and Buyer agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the proposed transaction in all dealings with employees of
Sellers or the Group Companies. Sellers shall not be required to provide such
access if to do so would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the
Group Companies or delivery of patient care and shall not be required to
violate any obligation of confidentiality to which it is subject or to waive
any privilege that it may possess in discharging its obligations pursuant to
this _Section 7.1_, so long as Sellers shall have used their commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information without violation of any such
obligation or applicable Law. Buyer agrees that such investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operations of the Group Companies. Buyer also agrees that it is not authorized
to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees, agents,
representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee (other than executive
officers), payor, supplier, vendor, customer, patient or other material
business relation of the Group Companies regarding the Contemplated
Transactions prior to the Closing, without the prior consent of Sellers.
Further, Buyer agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives will
visit any Group Company or Facility unless accompanied by a Representative of
Sellers (or unless Sellers authorize a visit without a Representative of
Sellers).

7.2 Further Actions; Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals.

(a) Each Party will act diligently and use its best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and

all conditions to the Closing; provided, however, that such action shall not
include any requirement of Sellers or any of their Affiliates to pay money to
any third party, commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

 

(b) By the close of business on the first Business Day following the date of
this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (or shall cause their ultimate

to and the exchange of information, use reasonable best efforts to promptly
inform the other Party of any communication received by, or given by, such

Body regarding the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required, including
responding to any Request for Additional Information or Documentary Material
received by the FTC or DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act and actions relating to the
same, to cause the expiration of the waiting periods or the receipt of
approval decisions under the HSR Act with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each Party shall consult
with the other Party in advance with respect to, and permit the other Party to
review in advance, any proposed correspondences, filings or communications by
such Party with any Governmental Body or members of its staff and provide the
other Party with a copy of all correspondences or communications from any
Governmental Body or members of its staff. No Party shall agree to participate
in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Body in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or
conference. Buyer and Sellers shall equally share all filing fees under the
HSR Act with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

Party such information as each of them may reasonably request relative to its
business, assets and property as may be required of each of them to file such
additional information. Each Party shall, subject to applicable Laws relating
to access to and the exchange of information, use reasonable best efforts to
promptly inform the other Party of any communication received by, or given by,
such Party from or to, as the case may be, the Arkansas State Department of
Health. Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such
action as may be required to cause the expiration of the waiting periods or
the receipt of approval decisions from the Arkansas State Department of
Health with respect to the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

to any of the provisions contained in _Article IV_ or _V_ , with respect to
matters first arising after the date hereof (each, an " _Update_ "), and each
such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment to

 



38  this Agreement for all purposes hereof other than for purposes of the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_; provided that, in the event that the
disclosure of the facts, circumstances and events included in such Update
would give Buyer the right to elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 12.1(b)_ if the 30-day cure period described therein had lapsed and
Buyer does not make such election within five (5) Business Days of its
receipt of such Update, such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment to this
Agreement for all purposes hereof, including with respect to the conditions
set forth in _Section 9.1_. Notwithstanding the above, no update shall
prejudice Buyers rights to indemnification under _Sections 11.1(a)(iii)-(v)_.

7.6 Exclusivity. During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Sellers shall not take, nor shall it permit any of its
Affiliates or Representatives to take, any action to solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, or enter into any agreement with, any Person (other than Buyer
and/or its Affiliates and Representatives) concerning any direct or indirect
acquisition of all or substantially all of the Units or assets of any Group
Company, or any merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
any Group Company (each, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), and Sellers and
their Affiliates and Representatives shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and other communications
with any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives)
with respect to any such Acquisition Transaction; provided, however, that
Buyer hereby acknowledges that prior to the date of this Agreement, Sellers
and their Affiliates and Representatives have provided information relating
to the Group Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions
with, other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and
that such information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another
Person to form a basis for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by
Sellers of this _Section 7.6_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Sellers shall notify Buyer promptly
upon the receipt of any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact from any Person
(other than Buyer or its Affiliates and Representatives) in respect of any
Acquisition Transaction. 

7.7 Additional Agreements. Buyer and the Sellers shall perform the agreements
contained in _Schedule 7.7_.

7.8 Risk of Loss. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, in the event
that there is any damage to or loss of any of the assets of a Group Company
in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (whether by fire, theft,
vandalism or other cause or casualty), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the amount necessary to repair the damage (" _Damage Repair Amount_ "), which
reduction shall be offset by any amounts paid by any Group Companys insurance
company and assigned to Buyer and received by Buyer by the Closing Date;
provided, however, in the event of a casualty constituting a Group Companies
Material Adverse Effect, Buyer, at its sole option, may elect to terminate
this Agreement in its entirety. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree as to
the Damage Repair Amount, then such amount shall be determined by an MAI
appraiser to be mutually selected and paid equally by Sellers and Buyer. If
Sellers and Buyer are unable to mutually select an appraiser, then one MAI
appraiser shall be selected and paid by Buyer and one MAI appraiser shall
be selected and paid by Sellers. If a party does not select an appraiser as
provided in the preceding sentence within ten (10) days after

 



39  the other party has given notice of the name of its appraiser, such party
shall lose its right to appoint an appraiser. If the two appraisers are
selected by the parties as provided above, they shall meet promptly to
determine the reduction in Purchase Price. If they are unable to agree within
fifteen (15) days after the second appraiser has been selected, they shall
jointly select a third MAI appraiser. The reduction in Purchase Price shall
be set by agreement of any two of the three appraisals. If the two appraisers
are unable to agree on a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after the
second appraiser has been selected, either party, by giving written notice
to the other, may apply to the American Arbitration Association for the
purpose of determining the reduction in Purchase Price. Sellers and Buyer
shall each bear one-half (1/2) of the cost of selecting the third appraiser
and of paying the third appraisers fee. The third appraiser, however
selected, shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for
any Party. If any two appraisers are unable to determine the reduction in
Purchase Price within fifteen (15) days after the third appraiser has been
selected, then the two appraisals that are closest shall be added together and
their total divided by two; the resulting quotient shall be the reduction in
Purchase Price (the third appraisal farthest from the remaining two shall be
ignored). In determining the reduction in Purchase Price, each appraiser shall
take into consideration, understand, and correctly employ those recognized
techniques that are necessary to produce a credible appraisal. 

7.9 Condemnation. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, in the event
that there is any condemnation of any of the assets of a Group Company in
excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount of such condemnation proceeds but the reduction shall be
offset by any amounts received by Buyer for such condemnation; provided,
however, in the event of any pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation
or eminent domain proceeding which constitutes a Group Companies Material
Adverse Effect, Buyer at its sole option, may elect to terminate
this Agreement in its entirety.

7.10 Options Cash Out. Sellers shall cause AmiCare to exercise its right,
pursuant to Section 4.2(d) of the 2007 Option Plan, (a) to cause all vested
and unvested Options to be cancelled as of the Effective Time and (b) to
convert all vested Options into the right to receive cash in the amount
provided in the 2007 Option Plan.

ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

8.1 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be liable for
and pay, and shall indemnify Sellers against, any Transfer Taxes that may be
imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and if required
by applicable Law, Sellers will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns
or other documentation.

(b) After the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate with each other by
furnishing any additional information and executing and delivering any
additional documents as 

 



40  may be reasonably requested by such Parties in their preparation of any Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Group Companies. Such
cooperation shall include access during normal business hours afforded to the
Parties and their respective agents and Representatives to, and reasonable
retention by such Parties of, Tax records related to the Group Companies, and
making employees and agents (including auditors) of the Group Companies
available on a reasonably convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(c)_ , neither Sellers nor any
Affiliate of Sellers shall file or cause or permit to be filed any amended Tax
Return or claims for refund with respect to the Group Companies or which
include the Group Companies or grant or cause or permit to be granted any
extension of any statute of limitation with respect to any Tax Returns for any
Taxable Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). None of Buyer, the Group
Companies or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit any Group
Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any
statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in
part to any Group Company with respect to any Taxable Period or portion of any
Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(d) Except for the federal and state income tax returns of AmiCare, which will
be prepared and filed by Sellers, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
in a manner consistent with the most recent Tax Returns of the Group
Companies and no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that
is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior
periods in filing such Tax Returns (unless Buyer determines there is no
reasonable basis for such position, election or method), all Tax Returns of or
with respect to the Group Companies that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date for (i) all Taxable Periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) all Straddle Periods; provided that Buyer shall deliver any
such Tax Return to Sellers in the form proposed for filing at least thirty
(30) Business Days prior to the due date thereof for review and approval by
Sellers, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Sellers shall notify Buyer of any requested changes to such returns
within ten (10) Business Days of Sellers receipt thereof. If Buyer objects to
Sellers requested changes, Buyer and Sellers will have five (5) Business
Days to resolve such dispute prior to submitting the disputed portion of such
return to the Accounting Firm for binding resolution prior to filing such Tax
Return. The Accounting Firm will promptly review only those items and amounts
specifically set forth in the requested change(s) and resolve the dispute with
respect to each requested change. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
will be borne by Sellers and Buyer in the percentage inversely proportionate
to the percentage of the total amount of the total items submitted for dispute
that are resolved in such partys favor, or determined by the Accounting Firm.
The decision of the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. Buyer shall file or cause to be filed, within the time and in the
manner required by applicable Law, such Tax Returns and pay or cause to be
paid all Taxes due and owing by the Group Companies with respect to such
Tax Returns, subject to the indemnification

 



41  provisions of _Section 11.1_. Buyer also shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Group
Companies for all Taxable Periods beginning after the Closing Date, and file
or cause to be filed, within the time and in the manner required by applicable
Law, all such Tax Returns and pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due and owing
with respect to such Tax Returns.

 

(e) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which could be payable if the Taxable Period ended on the
Closing Date and the Parties shall elect to do so if permitted by applicable
Law; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of any Group Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Taxable Period), multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period.

 

(f) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing within
fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving notice of any proposed assessment or
the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or
of any demand or claim on Buyer or any Group Company, that if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for
indemnification under _Section 11.1_. Such notice shall contain factual
information (to the extent known to Buyer) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any Tax Authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability. The failure to give notice as provided in this
_Section 8.1(f)_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

(i) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a "
_Contest_ ") relating to any Group Company solely with respect to a Taxable
Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall have the sole
right, at their expense, to control the conduct of such Contest; provided,
that, in the event that any such Contest could result in an adjustment to Tax
of any Group Company for a Taxable Period or portion of a Straddle Period
ending after the Closing Date, Sellers (A) shall permit Buyer, at its expense,
to participate in the proceeding solely with respect to an adjustment that
might affect the Tax liability of Buyer or any Group Company for a Taxable
Period ending after the Closing Date and (B) shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such Contest without the prior

 



42  written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be
required by Law, Sellers shall take no position that Buyer determines will
result in any material negative Tax consequence to Buyer or the Group
Companies after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). 

(ii) In the case of any other Contest relating to any Group Company, Buyer
shall have the sole right, at Buyers expense, to control the conduct of such
Contest; provided, that, in the event that any such Contest could result in an
adjustment to Tax of any Group Company for a Taxable Period or portion of a
Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date for which Sellers could
be liable pursuant to _Section 11.1_ hereof or otherwise, Buyer (A) shall
permit Sellers, at Sellers expense, to participate in the proceeding solely
with respect to an adjustment that could affect the Tax liability of Sellers
for a Taxable Period or portion of a Straddle Period ending on or before the
Closing Date and (B) shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Contest
without the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(g) For Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the
Parties agree to treat all payments made under any indemnity provisions
contained in this Agreement, and any payments in respect of any breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder,
as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(h) Buyer and Sellers agree that the Group Companies which are
corporations shall become members of the federal income tax consolidated
group of which Buyer is the common parent at the end of the day on the Closing
Date and such corporations federal income tax year shall end at the end of
the day on the Closing Date. To the extent applicable, any state or local
Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with provisions comparable
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b) under state or local Law. The
taxable year of all other Group Companies which are not corporations shall
end as of the Closing Date, and all federal Income Tax Returns (and to the
extent applicable, any state or local Income Tax Returns) shall be prepared
accordingly.

 

(i) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or any Group Company, and any
amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or any Group Company become
entitled, that relate to Taxable Periods or portions of Straddle Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid over to Sellers any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within five (5) Business Days after receipt or
entitlement thereto. Buyer will, and will cause the Group Companies to,
execute such documents, take reasonable additional actions and otherwise
reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for the Group Companies to perfect
their rights in and obtain all Tax refunds and credits for which any such
Person is eligible and to which Sellers is entitled. None of Buyer or Sellers
shall, or shall permit any Group Company to, forfeit, fail to collect or
otherwise minimize any Tax refund or credit to which Sellers would be
entitled, whether through any election to carry forward a net operating loss
or otherwise.

 



43 (j) Buyer and Sellers agree that the sale and purchase of AmiCare Units shall
be treated for federal tax purposes, and any analogous state or local tax
purposes, as a sale of the partnership interests of AmiCare by Sellers and the
acquisition of the assets of AmiCare, including the assets of any Subsidiaries
that are disregarded from AmiCare for federal Tax purposes, from Sellers by
Buyer, as provided in Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6. Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers at least ten (10) days prior to Closing, a schedule
that allocates the Purchase Price among the assets of the Group Companies
deemed purchased by Buyer. Such schedule shall be agreed upon by Buyer and
Sellers and shall be set forth in _Schedule 8.1_ (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ "). Except as required pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code or any similar provision of state or local Laws),
each Party agrees to report the federal, state, local and other Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with such treatment and Purchase Price Allocation and shall not
take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax
allocation and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
upon examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, or in any
litigation, investigation, or otherwise.

(k) Seller agrees to cause Pinewood Healthcare Realty, L.P. to make an
election under Section 754 of the Code with its federal income Tax Return for
the Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date, unless Buyer notifies Seller in
writing not to make such election.

8.2 Confidentiality. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all
confidential information relating to Sellers, the Group Companies, Buyer or
their respective Affiliates and businesses, including confidential matters
consisting of "know-how," trade secrets, customer lists, details of contracts,
pricing policies, operational and service methods, sales data, marketing
plans or strategies, service development techniques or plans, business
acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans, technical processes,
designs and design projects and inventions (collectively, " _Confidential
Information_ ") are valuable, special and unique assets of such Person to
which the Confidential Information belongs and are, and upon the Closing will
be, owned exclusively by such Person. Each Party agrees to, and agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees,
partners, Affiliates, agents, advisors (including accountants and legal
counsel) and other representatives (" _Representatives_ ") to, treat
the Confidential Information, together with any other confidential
information furnished to Sellers or the Group Companies or their respective
Affiliates by Buyer or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or to Buyer or its
Affiliates by Sellers, the Group Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, as confidential and not to make use of such
information for its own purposes or for the benefit of any other Person. To
the extent the terms in this _Section 8.2_ conflict with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2012, between AmiCare and
Buyer or its Affiliate (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of
this _Section 8.2_ shall supersede the conflicting terms in the
Confidentiality Agreement.`

 



44 8.3 Employment Matters.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that it and the Group Companies shall make COBRA continuation
coverage (as described in Section 601 of ERISA) available for all individuals
who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 as a result of the Contemplated Transactions.
Buyer agrees that, following the Closing Date, it will not take any action
which would trigger liability for Sellers or any of its Affiliates under the
WARN Act.

(b) Substantially all employees of the Group Companies shall continue to be
employed by the Group Companies on an at will basis as of and following the
Closing. All of the employees employed by the Group Companies after the
Closing shall be referred to herein as " _Acquired Employees_."

(c) Reserved.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause all Acquired Employees
to be granted credit for any service with Sellers and any Group Company
earned prior to the Closing Date for purposes of benefit eligibility and
vesting (but not benefit accrual). In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer
shall cause all covered expenses incurred during the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs by any Acquired Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the
Closing Date for the remainder of such calendar year.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if requested by Buyer,
Sellers hereby covenant and agree to amend, merge, terminate or take any other
action with respect to the Benefit Plans, including but not limited to,
causing any Benefit Plan to spin-off or transfer the accrued aggregate
account balances of its employees to a plan or plans specified by Buyer; to
take all steps necessary to accomplish such requests; to provide all the
required notices to participants and appropriate Governmental Bodies; to adopt
all necessary resolutions and Benefit Plan amendments in order to accomplish
such requests; and to provide to Buyer satisfactory evidence of such actions.

8.4 Access to Records after Closing. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates and Representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Group Companies to
the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Sellers in
connection with any legitimate matter relating to or affected by the
operations of the Group Companies prior to the Closing Date. Such access
shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. Sellers shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 8.4_. If Buyer or
any Group Company shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records
prior to the expiration of such 6-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers may select.

8.5 Tail Insurance. On or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall have
provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that AmiCare has purchased
fully-paid extended reporting period under AmiCares existing general and
professional liability policy to remain in 

 



45  place for a period of at least three (3) years from the Effective Time (the
"Tail Policy"). Buyer, any of its Affiliates reasonably determined by Buyer,
and Sellers will be listed as additional insureds with respect to the Tail
Policy. Buyer shall not cause or permit AmiCare to terminate or amend the Tail
Policy or any coverage provided thereunder after the Effective Time. Sellers
shall pay the premium for the Tail Policy. 

8.6 Cost Reports.

(a) None of Buyer, the Group Companies or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or
shall cause or permit any Group Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify
(or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any cost
report filed with any Government Healthcare Program for any period ending on
or before the Closing Date, including any such cost report filed after the
Closing Date for such prior periods without the prior written consent of
Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with
the most recent cost reports of the Group Companies, and no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such cost
reports (unless Buyer determines there is no reasonable basis for such
position, election or method), all cost reports of or with respect to the
Group Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing Date for (i)
all Cost Report Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all
Cost Report Straddle Periods; provided that Buyer shall deliver any such cost
report to Sellers in the form proposed for filing at least twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the due date thereof for review and approval by
Sellers, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Sellers shall notify Buyer of any requested changes to such cost
reports within ten (10) Business Days of Sellers receipt thereof. If Buyer
objects to Sellers requested changes, Buyer and Sellers will have five (5)
Business Days to resolve such dispute prior to submitting the disputed portion
of such cost report to the Accounting Firm for binding resolution prior to
filing such cost report. The Accounting Firm will promptly review only those
items and amounts specifically set forth in the requested change(s) and
resolve the dispute with respect to each requested change. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne by Sellers and Buyer in the
percentage inversely proportionate to the percentage of the total amount of
the total items submitted for dispute that are resolved in such partys
favor, or determined by the Accounting Firm. The decision of the Accounting
Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Buyer shall file or
cause to be filed, within the time and in the manner required by applicable
Law, such cost reports.

(c) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing within
fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving notice of any proposed reopening of
any cost report or of any demand or claim on Buyer or any Group Company, that
if determined adversely to Buyer or any Group Company or after the lapse of
time, could be grounds for indemnification under _Section 11.1_. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known to Buyer) describing
the asserted basis for reopening in reasonable detail and shall include copies
of any notice or other document received from any

 



46  Governmental Body in respect of any such reopening. The failure to give
notice as provided in this _Section 8.6(b)_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been
prejudiced by such failure.

(i) In the case of a proposed cost report settlement, cost report reopening
or administrative or judicial proceeding related to a cost report (a " _Cost
Report Contest_ ") relating to any Group Company solely with respect to a Cost
Report Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall have the
sole right, at their expense, to control the conduct of such Cost Report
Contest; provided, that, in the event that any such Cost Report Contest could
result in an adjustment to reimbursement of any Group Company for a Cost
Report Period or portion of a Cost Report Straddle Period ending after the
Closing Date, Sellers (A) shall permit Buyer, at its expense, to participate
in the proceeding solely with respect to an adjustment that might affect
the reimbursment of Buyer or any Group Company for a Cost Report Period
ending after the Closing Date and (B) shall not settle or otherwise compromise
such Cost Report Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be required by Law, Sellers shall
take no position that Buyer determines will result in any material negative
consequence to Buyer or the Group Companies under any Government Healthcare
Program after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 

(ii) In the case of any other Cost Report Contest relating to any Group
Company, Buyer shall have the sole right, at Buyers expense, to control the
conduct of such Cost Report Contest; provided, that, in the event that any
such Cost Report Contest could result in an adjustment to payments made to any
Group Company for a Cost Report Period or portion of a Cost Report Straddle
Period ending on or before the Closing Date for which Sellers could be liable
pursuant to _Section 11.1_ hereof or otherwise, Buyer (A) shall permit
Sellers, at Sellers expense, to participate in the proceeding solely with
respect to an adjustment that could affect the liability of Sellers for
payments to a Government Healthcare Program for a Cost Report Period or
portion of a Cost Report Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date
and (B) shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Cost Report Contest
without the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

8.7 Further Assurances. Each Party will use reasonable best efforts to take
all further actions and execute and deliver all further documents that are
necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements and Seller Ancillary Agreements.

8.8 Covenant Not to Compete. Sellers and their Affiliates hereby covenant and
agree with Buyer and its Affiliates that, during the Non-Compete Period (as
such term is defined below) and within the Non-Compete Area (as such term is
defined below), they shall not directly

 



47  or indirectly, (a) acquire, lease, manage, consult for, serve as agent or
subcontractor for, finance, invest in, own any part of or exercise management
control over any in-patient psychiatric facility or business that provides
services that are the same or similar to the services provided by any of the
Facilities (a " _Competing Business_ "); (b) solicit for employment or employ
any person who is employed by the Group Companies as of the Closing Date or
any Acquired Employee (other than general media advertisements of employment
opportunities), or (c) disrupt or attempt to disrupt any past, present or
reasonably foreseeable future relationship, contractual or otherwise between
the Facilities, on the one hand, and any physician, physician group, or other
healthcare provider with whom any Group Company contracts with in connection
with the Facilities or make statements to the same that disparage Buyer and
its Affiliates or their respective operations in any way. The " _Non-Compete
Period_ " shall commence on the Closing Date and terminate on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date. The " _Non-Compete Area_ " shall mean the
area within State of Arkansas. Ownership of less than three percent (3%) of
the stock of a publicly held company shall not be deemed a breach of this
covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing restrictions shall not
preclude Sellers or any of their Affiliates from (A) acquiring, by asset or
stock purchase, merger or otherwise, any entity or multiple facilities from an
entity which engages in a Competing Business (the "Acquired Competing
Business"), so long as (x) such acquisition is consummated not less than
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date and (y) provided the gross
revenue attributable to such Acquired Competing Business derived within the
Non-Compete Area for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the
date of the acquisition of such Acquired Competing Business comprises less
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross revenue attributable to all
businesses included in the Acquired Competing Business for the twelve (12)
month period immediately preceding the date of the acquisition of such
Acquired Competing Business, or (B) being acquired by asset or stock purchase,
merger or otherwise, by any unaffiliated entity which engages in a Competing
Business.

8.9 Enforceability. In the event of a breach of  _Section 8.8_, Sellers and
their Affiliates recognize that monetary damages shall be inadequate to
compensate Buyer and its Affiliates, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be
entitled, without the posting of a bond or similar security, to an injunction
restraining such breach, with the costs (including attorneys fees) of
securing such injunction to be borne by the breaching party. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer and its Affiliates from
pursuing any other remedy available for such breach or threatened breach. All
parties hereby acknowledge the necessity of protection against the competition
of Sellers and their Affiliates and that the nature and scope of such
protection has been carefully considered by the parties. The period provided
and the area covered are expressly represented and agreed to be fair,
reasonable and necessary. The consideration provided for herein is deemed to
be sufficient and adequate to compensate the Sellers and their Affiliates for
agreeing to the restrictions contained in _Section 8.8_. If, however, any
court determines that the forgoing restrictions are not reasonable, such
restrictions shall be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much
of their nature and scope as will render them enforceable.

 



48 ARTICLE IX

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER

Unless waived in accordance with this _Article IX_ , the obligations of Buyer
under this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions on or prior to the Closing Date:

9.1 No Misrepresentation or Breach of Warranties.

(a) The representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in this Agreement
shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date (other
than to the extent that the representation or warranty is expressly limited
by its terms to another date, in which case the representation or warranty
shall have been true and correct on that date), except for inaccuracies of

behalf of a Government Healthcare Program;

(iv) any Taxes imposed upon or payable by any of the Group Companies for any
Taxable Period, or portion of any Straddle Period, ending on or prior to the

(ii) under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ and/or _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_, the

(Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreement), _Section 4.4_ (Title to
Units), _Section 5.2_ (Capitalization), _Section 5.7_ (Taxes),  _Section

(c) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)_ shall terminate on
the Escrow Release Date (and no claims shall be commenced by any Buyer Group
Member under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ thereafter), provided that the
indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ as it relates to claims

Agreement), _Section 4.4_ (Title to Units), _Section 5.2_ (Capitalization),

prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
accordance with this _Section 11.1(c),_ as to which the obligation of Sellers
shall continue solely with respect to the specific matters in such Claim
Notice until the liability of Sellers shall have been determined pursuant to
this _Article XI_ , and Sellers shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group Members
for the full amount of such Losses that are payable with respect to such Claim
Notice in accordance with this _Article XI_. 

11.2 Indemnification by Buyer.

 

(a) Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller Group
Member from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller Group
Member in connection with or arising from:

(i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Buyer contained in _Article VI_ or in the certificate delivered by Buyer to
Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.1_ of this Agreement;

 

(ii) any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any of its
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement; or

(iii) any Taxes imposed upon or payable by any of the Group Companies for any
Taxable Period (or portion thereof) that begins after the Closing Date or the
portion of any Straddle Period after the Closing Date.

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)_ shall terminate on
the Escrow Release Date (and no claims shall be commenced by any Seller Group
Member under  _Section 11.2(a)_ thereafter), provided that the
indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ as it relates to
_Section 6.2_ (Authority, Validity and Effect of Agreement) shall terminate
upon the expiration of the statute of limitations related thereto, and the
indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ as it relates to
covenants shall terminate on the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
period specified in the covenant or the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (and no claims shall be commenced by any Seller Group Member
under _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_ thereafter). The indemnification by Buyer shall
continue as to any Losses of which any Seller Group Member has validly given
a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_
on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
accordance with this _Section 11.2(b),_ as to which the obligation of Buyer
shall continue solely with respect to the specific matters in such Claim
Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to
this _Article XI_ , and Buyer shall have reimbursed Seller for the full
amount of such Losses that are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in
accordance with this _Article XI_.

 

11.3 Notice of Claims. Any Person seeking or intending to seek indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give promptly to the Party or
Parties obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (each,
the " _Indemnitor_ ") a written notice (a

 



54  " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such
claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith
upon which such claim is based.

 

11.4 Resolution of Indemnifiable Claims. After the giving of any Claim Notice
pursuant to _Section 11.3_, the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this _Article XI_ shall be
determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal
shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it. Once a Loss is payable
pursuant to this  _Section 11.4_, the Indemnitor shall satisfy its
obligations by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Indemnified Party, provided that, in the event
that Sellers are required to indemnify any Buyer Group Member, such payment
shall be satisfied solely by withdrawals from the Escrow Amount in accordance
with _Section 2.1_ and the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

11.5 Third Party Claims.

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking or intending to seek indemnification under
this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving any claim, action,
demand or Proceeding made by any Person who is not a Party or Affiliate
thereof (a "Third Party Claim") against the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give a Claim Notice to the Indemnitor(s) with respect to the Third Party
Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnitor, after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices, pleadings, demands and documents received by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates or Representatives relating to the Third Party Claim. The
failure to give notice as provided in this _Section 11.5_ shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the sole
and absolute right, at its election (within twenty (20) Business Days
following its receipt of Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim) and at its expense, to control, defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim using counsel
of its choice; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may participate
in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its sole expense. The
Indemnitor shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the settlement does not
include as a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such Third
Party Claim to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so elect to
undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to undertake the defense against the Third Party Claim;
provided, that

 



55  the Indemnified Party shall not settle or otherwise compromise any such
Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Parties agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim.

(c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 11.5_ and
_Section 8.1(f)_ (relating to Tax Contests), the provisions of _Section
8.1(f)_ shall control with respect to Tax Contests.

11.6 Determination of Indemnification Amounts.

 

(a) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article XI_ shall be
determined net of (i) any Tax benefits realized by any Indemnified Party
arising from the deductibility of any such Losses and (ii) any amounts
actually received by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies,
indemnities, warranties or other reimbursement arrangements with respect to
such Losses. Each Party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses and agrees, promptly following
such other Partys request, to file any applicable insurance claims and will
take all reasonable necessary, proper or desirable actions (including the
execution and delivery of any document reasonably requested) to accomplish the
foregoing.

 

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _Article XI_ , such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the amount of reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Losses (including using commercially reasonable efforts to recover
under applicable insurance policies or other indemnities and incurring costs
only as reasonably necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such
Loss) upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder.

 

(d) No Buyer Group Member shall have any right to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article XI_ with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss if such matter was
included on the Closing Date Balance Sheet or Buyer received a reduction in
the Purchase Price pursuant to _Article II_.

 

(e) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

(f) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses incurred arising out
of or relating to a breach or an inaccuracy, no effect shall be given to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification provided in any
representation or warranty of Sellers or Buyer.

 



56 11.7 Exclusive Remedy. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy against Sellers with respect to
any and all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XI_.

page. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the Parties. The Parties may deliver
executed signature pages to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail
transmission. No Party may raise (a) the use of a facsimile or email
transmission to deliver a signature or (b) the fact that any signature,
agreement or instrument was signed and subsequently transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile or e-mail transmission as a
defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract, and each Party
forever waives any such defense.

 



60 13.12 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect hereof shall be brought and determined in the United
States federal courts located in Delaware, or if such legal action or
proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional purposes, in
the state courts of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby (i) irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any Contemplated Transaction and waives the defense of
sovereign immunity, (ii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court or that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum and (iii)
agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
Contemplated Transaction in any court other than any Delaware state or federal
court sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.

 

13.13 Remedies.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, may occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article XII_ , the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which the Parties are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
