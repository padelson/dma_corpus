"), Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ _Parent__ "), and Royal
Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned direct or indirect

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _ _Merger__ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

_THE OFFER AND THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME_

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
Article VII, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the " _ _Exchange Act__ ")), a tender offer to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _ _Common
Stock__ "), of the Company (the " _ _Shares__ ") at a price of $137.00 per
Share in cash, net to the seller but subject to any required withholding taxes
(such tender offer and price, as they may from time to time be amended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _ _Offer__ " and the " _ _Offer Price__
," respectively). The obligations of Merger Sub to (and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub to) accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted under applicable Laws) of the conditions set
forth in Annex A (the " _ _Tender Offer Conditions__ "), and no other
conditions. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight
(Eastern Time) on the date that is twenty-five (25) Business Days (determined
as provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date on
which the Offer was commenced (the initial " _ _Expiration Time__ " and any
expiration time and date established pursuant to an extension of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, also an Expiration Time). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right (i) to increase the amount of cash constituting
the Offer Price and (ii) to waive any condition to the Offer (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws) or modify the terms of the Offer,
except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub
shall not (A) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the
Offer Price, (C) waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (D) add to   the Tender Offer Conditions or amend or modify any Tender Offer Condition in
any manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (E) except as otherwise provided
in this Section 1.1, extend the Expiration Time, (F) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, _provided_ , that nothing in this clause
(F) shall limit Merger Subs ability to provide additional cash consideration
in addition to the cash Offer Price, or (G) otherwise amend the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger
Sub may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Company, (x)
extend the Expiration Time for one or more consecutive increments of not more
than ten (10) Business Days each (the length of such period to be determined
by Parent or Merger Sub), if at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Time any
Tender Offer Condition has not been satisfied or waived (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws), until the earlier of (1) the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (2) the date on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), (y) extend the Expiration
Time for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _ _SEC__ ") or
the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, or (z) make available a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11. If
at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Time any Tender Offer Condition has not
been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Laws),
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Expiration
Time at the request of the Company for one or more consecutive increments of
not more than ten (10) Business Days (the length of such periods to be
determined by Parent) each until the earlier of (1) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (2) the Outside Date. In addition,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), if requested by
the Company, make available a subsequent offering period in accordance with
Exchange Act Rule 14d-11 of not less than ten (10) Business Days; _provided_
that Merger Sub shall not be required to make available such a subsequent
offering period in the event that, prior to the commencement of such
subsequent offering period, Parent and Merger Sub directly or indirectly own
more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment all Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the Expiration Time (the time and date on which Merger Sub accepts such
Shares for payment, the " _ _Acceptance Time__ "), and pay for such Shares as
promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time. Parent shall (or shall
cause Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent to) provide or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall not terminate
or withdraw the Offer without the prior written consent of the Company other
than in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII
prior to any scheduled Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Business
Day__ " shall have the meaning provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act, and the term " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any
Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities or
ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries. 

 



2 (b) On the date on which the Offer is commenced, Parent and Merger Sub
shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein, together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _ _Offer Documents__ "), shall make all deliveries, mailings
and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, and
shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and
to the extent required by the United States federal securities Laws and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "
_ _Securities Laws__ "). Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents
to comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws. Parent and Merger
Sub shall deliver copies of the proposed forms of the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) to the Company within a
reasonable time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof for review and
comment by the Company and its counsel. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall (i) respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer or the Offer Documents and (ii) promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall amend or supplement the Offer Documents and cause the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Securities Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity under the
circumstances to review and comment on any written or oral responses to such
comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the Company Recommendation as it may be amended or modified, and until but
not after a Change of Recommendation is effected, in each case as permitted by
this Agreement. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiary and the Companys
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(b).

shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _ _Schedule 14D-9__"), which, subject
to Section 5.2, shall contain the Company Recommendation. Parent shall cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of Shares along with the
Offer Documents, in accordance with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and the
Securities Laws. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies
of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the
dissemination or filing thereof for review and comment by Parent and its
counsel. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and
(ii) promptly correct 

 



3  any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Securities Laws. The Company
shall amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment
on any written or oral responses to such comments. Parent and Merger

connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a).

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Merger Sub (i) a list of the names and addresses of the
record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses and (ii) security position
lists, computer files and any other information identifying the beneficial
owners of Shares, in each case as of the most recent practicable date which
the Company or its transfer agent have in their possession or control or can
obtain without unreasonable effort or expense. The Company shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to Merger Sub such additional information (including
updates to the items provided pursuant to the preceding sentence) and such
other assistance as Merger Sub may reasonably request in communicating the
Offer to the record and beneficial owners of Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to
the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or
control.

 

1.3 _Company Directors_.

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter (but
only for so long as Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates beneficially own
at least a majority of the outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted
basis)), Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate to the board of
directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ") such number of
directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number, as is equal to the product
of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant to this sentence)
_multiplied_ _by_ the percentage of the outstanding Shares (determined on a
fully diluted basis) that are then beneficially owned by Merger Sub and its
Affiliates and to have such designees be elected or appointed to such classes
of the Company Board so as to be as evenly distributed as possible among
the three classes of directors on the Company Board. As used in this
Agreement, the terms " _ _beneficial ownership__ " (and its correlative terms)
and " _ _Affiliate__ " shall have the meanings provided in Rule 13d-3 and
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, respectively. Upon any exercise of such
right by Merger Sub, the

 



4  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) elect or appoint to the
Company Board the individuals designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so
elected or designated by the preceding sentence, including by promptly
filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board,
increasing the size of the Company Board and/or securing the resignations of
such number of its incumbent directors, and (ii) cause the directors so
elected or appointed to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the
nearest whole number) of the members of each committee of the Company Board as
such directors represent of the Company Board, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of the NASDAQ Stock
Market (" _ _NASDAQ__ "). The Companys obligations under this Section 1.3(a)
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 such information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board. Merger Sub shall timely furnish to the Company, and be solely
responsible for, information with respect to Merger Subs designees and
Parents and Merger Subs respective officers, directors and Affiliates to the
extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this
Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a holder
or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Merger Subs designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time (and
subject to any further designations permitted to be made by Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) from time to time), the Company and Parent shall
allow (i) at least three (3) members of the Company Board to consist of
individuals who were members of the Company Board on the date hereof (the " _
_Existing Directors__ "), (ii) the Existing Directors who are members of the
audit committee of the Company Board immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement to remain as members of the audit committee of the Company Board
and (iii) such audit committee to comply with all requirements of the
Securities Laws and NASDAQ applicable thereto. If any Existing Director is
unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, then the remaining
Existing Directors (or, if no Existing Director is then in office, the
members of the Company Board) shall be entitled to elect or appoint another
individual to fill each such vacancy, which individual shall not be an
officer, director, employee or agent of, or otherwise affiliated with, Parent
or Merger Sub and shall otherwise satisfy all requirements of the Securities
Laws and NASDAQ applicable for a member of an audit committee, and each such
individual shall be deemed to be an Existing Director for purposes of this
Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Effective Time when Merger Subs designees constitute a majority
of the Company Board, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Existing
Directors, acting _qua_ audit committee of the Company Board, shall be
required and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ "), be sufficient to
(i) on behalf of the Company to agree to amend, modify or terminate this
Agreement or to amend or modify the terms or conditions of the Offer or the
Merger, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies under
this Agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parents or Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement or (iv) enforce any obligation of
Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement. The Existing Directors, acting
_qua_ audit committee of the Company Board, shall have the authority to retain
counsel (which may include current counsel to the

 



5  Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
appropriate by the Existing Directors and shall have the authority, after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _
_Top-Up Option__ ") to purchase from the Company up to that number of newly
issued shares of Common Stock (the " _ _Top-Up Option Shares__ ") equal to the
lesser of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the
number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of exercise, shall
constitute one Share more than the number of Shares necessary for Merger Sub
to be merged into the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), and (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to
issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued or
reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, in each
case, for consideration per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price.

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, any time at
or after the Acceptance Time (the " _ _Purchase Date__ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable if the Minimum
Tender Condition has been satisfied and, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall terminate
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

(c) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger
Sub shall give the Company written notice specifying the number of shares of
Common Stock that Merger Sub and its Affiliates own immediately preceding the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay
the applicable exercise price and the place and a time for the closing of such
purchase. The Company shall, promptly following receipt of such notice,
deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying the number of Top-Up Option
Shares to be issued and the consideration due in exchange therefor, calculated
in accordance with Section 1.4(a). At the closing of the purchase for the Top-
Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the consideration due in
exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares either (i) in cash (by wire transfer or
cashiers check) or (ii) by delivery of cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option Shares (by wire transfer or
cashiers check) _plus_ a promissory note for the balance due having full
recourse to Parent, bearing interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per
annum, maturing on the first anniversary of the date of execution and
delivery of such promissory note and being pre-payable without penalty and
having no other material terms, and the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a
certificate representing such Top-Up Option Shares or, upon Merger Subs
request or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares,
the applicable number of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry. The
Company Board has determined that such consideration for the Top-Up Option
Shares is adequate in accordance with the DGCL and otherwise taken all steps
necessary such that upon issuance and delivery in accordance with this Section
1.4(c) the Top-Up Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable.

 



6 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in any
appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of
Common Stock held by Dissenting Stockholders, the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Option Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by Merger Sub to the
Company in payment for such Top-Up Option Shares shall not be taken into
account in connection with the determination of the fair value of the shares
of Common Stock held by the Dissenting Stockholders in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL.

1.5 _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _
_Securities Ac_ t_"), and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption from registration under the Securities Act for transactions not
involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and
warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501
of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 

1.6 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises and all its debts, liabilities, obligations
and duties, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in
Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

1.7 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company
and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take place
at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times
Square, New York, New York 10036, at 10:00 am (Eastern Time) on the third
Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived (to
the extent permitted under applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall be satisfied or waived (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) in accordance with this
Agreement.

1.8 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
parties hereto shall cause a Certificate of Merger (such Certificate of
Merger, or the Certificate of Ownership and Merger referenced below, as
applicable, the " _ _Delaware Certificate of Merger__ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be
agreed by the parties hereto in writing in accordance with the DGCL and
specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ ").
If Parent and Merger 

 



7  Sub own, directly or indirectly, a number of Shares sufficient to enable the
Merger to be consummated without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, then the parties hereto agree that
Merger Sub shall effect the Merger without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL by filing a Certificate of
Ownership and Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the DGCL.

ARTICLE II

 

 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS_

_OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

2.1 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Charter__
") shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth on Annex B, and such amended and restated Charter shall
become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

2.2 _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth on Annex
C and shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Bylaws__ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

2.3 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto
shall take all actions necessary so that the directors and officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the Bylaws.

ARTICLE III

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_  

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Shares
owned by the Company or its Subsidiary and (iii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders who properly demand appraisal of their Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") (the Shares described in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ "),
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Offer Price (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__
") that immediately prior to

 



8  the Effective Time represented any of the Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without interest. 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under Section 3.2(f). 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

3.2  _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares and pursuant to a paying agent agreement in customary
form, cash in immediately available dollar-denominated funds in the aggregate
amount necessary for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by
Section 3.1(a) (such cash, the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). If Parent determines
to invest the Exchange Fund, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to invest the
Exchange Fund in direct short-term obligations of, or obligations fully
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of, the United States of America or
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the foregoing, and, in each case, with maturities not
exceeding three (3) months. To the extent there are losses with respect to
such investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reasons below
the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds
required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1(a), Parent shall promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 3.1(a) shall be promptly paid to Parent.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



9  Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.5) equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.2(e)), _multiplied_ _by_ (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or affidavits of loss, as the case may be. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that all applicable transfer Taxes and other similar
Taxes required to be paid in connection with such transfer of ownership of
Shares have been paid or are not applicable. 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be (subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 3.2(b)) cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration upon due surrender of such holders Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, and subject to compliance with the
exchange procedures of Section 3.2(b)), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. If
any Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of (i) the third
anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective or (ii) the date
immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Certificate
represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, then such cash amount shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the

 



10  posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and on such terms as
may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of
Section 3.2(b)) issue a check in the amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f)  _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who properly demands appraisal of his
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn such demand or
otherwise lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting
Stockholder. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Excluded Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

 

3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Options_. Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") awarded under the Stock
Plans, shall fully vest and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
thereof to receive an amount in cash as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time equal to (i) the product of (A) the total number of Shares
subject to a Company Option immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
_multiplied_ _by_ (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under such Company Option,
_less_ (ii) applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, any vesting
conditions or restrictions applicable to any shares of restricted stock (each
such share, a share of " _ _Company Restricted Stock__ ") granted pursuant to
the Stock Plans shall lapse, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to
tender any such shares of Company Restricted Stock for purchase in the Offer,
provided that applicable Taxes shall be withheld with respect to the
consideration payable or deliverable in accordance with Section 3.5.

(c)  _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company,
the Company Board and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b).

 



11 3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend, distribution or division, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender offer or issuer exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Offer
Price and the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted. 

3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect thereto under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _ _Code__ ") or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (a) shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity as required by applicable Law,
and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Persons in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

4.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
(i) the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC on or prior to the
date hereof (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk
factor section or in any other section to the extent they are forward-looking
statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature); _provided_
, _however_ , that the exception provided for in this clause (i) shall be
applied with respect to a particular representation or warranty only to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such representation or warranty or (ii) the
disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into
this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Schedule__ ") (with each exception
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule being identified by reference
to, or grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or
subsection of this Agreement and relating only to such section or subsection;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a matter disclosed with respect to one
representation or warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect
to each other representation or warranty to which the matter disclosed
reasonably relates, but only to the extent that such relationship is
reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedule), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiary is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate with other

 



12  such failures, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Companys and its Subsidiarys
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended as of the date hereof, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect.

 

As used in this Agreement, the term " _ _Company Material Adverse Effect__ "
means any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations, Covered Assets, liabilities or financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole; except to the extent that
such material adverse effect results from any of the following: (i) any
changes in general United States or global economic conditions, except to the
extent that such changes have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse
effect that such changes have on other development-stage companies in the
pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry (in which case only the
incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in
determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);
(ii) any changes in conditions generally affecting the pharmaceutical or
biotechnology industries, except to the extent that such changes in
conditions have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company
and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such
changes have on other development-stage companies in the pharmaceutical or
biotechnology industry (in which case only the incremental disproportionate
adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has
occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect); (iii) any decline in the
market price or trading volume of the Shares on NASDAQ ( _provided_ that the
exception in this clause (iii) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any event, change, effect, development, state of fact,
condition, circumstance or occurrence causing such decline has resulted in or
contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect); (iv) any regulatory,
legislative or political conditions or securities, credit, financial or other
capital markets conditions, in each case in the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction; (v) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company or its
Subsidiary to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates
or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period ( _provided_ that the exception in this
clause (v) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any
event, change, effect, development, state of fact, condition, circumstance
or occurrence causing such failure has resulted in or contributed to a
Company Material Adverse Effect); (vi) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the performance by any party hereto of its obligations hereunder,
or the public announcement or pendency of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, including the impact thereof on the relationships,
contractual or otherwise, of the Company with its employees or with any other
third party ( _provided_ that the exceptions in this clause (vi) shall not
apply to any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.1(d)(ii) (or
any portion thereof) to the extent the purpose of such representation or
warranty (or any portion thereof) is to address the consequences resulting
from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder); (vii) changes or proposed changes in
GAAP applicable to the Company or the enforcement or interpretation thereof;
(viii) any geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities,
any acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions, or any escalation or
worsening of any such hostilities, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or
military actions threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement,
except to the extent that such events, acts or changes have a materially

 



13  disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiary, taken as
a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such changes have on other
development-stage companies in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry
(in which case the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken
into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect), (ix) except for any requirement to operate in the ordinary
course of business, any action required to be taken or refrained from being
taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement or taken or refrained
from being taken at the request of Parent or Merger Sub; or (x) any matter
set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any other
part of the Company Disclosure Schedule that contains disclosure that
reasonably relates to any matter set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, but only if such relationship is reasonably apparent on
the face of the disclosure in such other part of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. As used in this Agreement, the term " _ _Covered Assets__ " means
the Companys assets associated with the Key Product.

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of (A) 100,000,000 Shares, of which 75,750,565 were outstanding as of the
close of business on November 18, 2011, and (B) 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share, none of which were outstanding as of the
close of business on November 18, 2011. All of the outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As
of the close of business on November 18, 2011, there were 5,835,539 Shares
reserved for issuance under the 1998 Stock Plan and the 2007 Equity Incentive
Plan (together, the " _ _Stock Plans__ "). Section 4.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of Company Options
and Company Restricted Stock issued and outstanding as of the close of
business on October 31, 2011, including the holder, date of grant, term,
number of Shares and, where applicable, exercise price. Each Company
Option has been granted with an exercise price no less than the fair market
value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Companys Subsidiary is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by
the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest,
claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except as set forth above
and except for the Top-Up Option, there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or its Subsidiary
to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Company or its Subsidiary or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or its Subsidiary, and
no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary (i) is a party to
any agreement with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company
(other than this Agreement) or (ii) has any contractual obligation to file a
registration statement under the Securities Act, in respect of any securities
of the Company or its Subsidiary. Upon any issuance of any Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
any Lien. Upon any issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with

 



14  the stockholders of the Company on any matter. Other than Pharmasset UK
Limited, an English company, the Company has no Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, subject
only, with respect to the consummation of the Merger, if required by the DGCL,
to the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a
stockholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company
Requisite Vote__ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " _
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception__ ").

(ii) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company Board adopted resolutions by the unanimous vote
of all directors of the Company (A) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _ _Transactions__ ") in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (B) determining that the terms
of the Offer, this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and to the holders of the Shares
and (C) recommending that the holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Shares into the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable Law to
consummate the Merger, vote their Shares in favor of adopting this Agreement
(such recommendation, the " _ _Company Recommendation__ "), and, as of the
date hereof, none of the aforesaid actions by the Company Board have been
amended, rescinded or modified. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.2(h), the Company Board has taken all
actions necessary so that Parent and Merger Sub will not be prohibited by
Section 203 of the DGCL from consummating the Transactions in the manner
contemplated hereby and to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL will not impose
any additional procedural, voting, approval or other restrictions on the
timely consummation of the Transactions or restrict, impair or delay the
ability of (x) Parent or Merger Sub to engage in any of the Transactions with
the Company or (y) Parent or Merger Sub, following the Acceptance Time and
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, to vote or
otherwise exercise all rights as a stockholder of the Company. No other state
takeover statute applies to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions.

(iii) The Company Board has received the oral opinion of its financial
advisor, Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, to the effect that, as of the date hereof,
the consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Offer
and the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. A
written version of such opinion will be delivered to Parent promptly following
its receipt by the Company, it being agreed and understood that such opinion
is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied on by Parent or
Merger Sub.

 



15 (d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

(i) Other than (A) the filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger, (B)

Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _ _HSR Act__ ") or any other applicable
antitrust or competition Law, (C) compliance with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act, including the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 in connection
with the Offer and the Proxy Statement, if applicable, in connection with the
Company Requisite Vote, (D) compliance with the rules and regulations of
NASDAQ or FINRA and (E) the other filings, consents and/or notices set forth
on Section 4.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no notices, reports
or other filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be
obtained by the Company from, any domestic or foreign governmental,
administrative or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or
other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each, a " _
_Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except those that the failure
to make or obtain, individually or in the aggregate with other such failures,
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transaction.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of,
or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
or the comparable governing instruments of its Subsidiary, (B) a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien
on any of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiary pursuant to any lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, or other agreement (each, a " _
_Contract__ ") to which the Company or its Subsidiary is a party (C)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.1(d)(i) and (if
applicable) receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, a violation of any Law to
which the Company or its Subsidiary is subject, (D) the loss or impairment of,
payment of any additional amounts with respect to or the consent of any other
Person being required in respect of, the Companys or its Subsidiarys right
to own or use any Company Intellectual Property or (E) any change in the
rights or obligations of any party under any Contract to which the Company or
its Subsidiary is a party, except, in the case of clause (B), (D) or (E)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation or
acceleration that, individually or in the aggregate with other such matters,
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

(iii) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary is a party to any non-competition
Contracts or other Contract that purports to limit in any material respect
either the type of business in which the Company or its Subsidiary (or, after
giving effect to the Offer or the Merger, Parent or its Subsidiaries) may
engage or the manner or locations in which either of them may so engage in
any business.

 



16 (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) Since October 1, 2008, the Company has filed or furnished, as applicable,
on a timely basis all forms, statements, certifications, reports and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the forms, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished since October 1, 2008 and those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the
" _ _Company Reports__ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act__ "). As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(iii) The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) is effective in
providing reasonable assurance (A) that the Company maintains records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and
dispositions of assets, (B) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (C) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with authorizations of management
and the Company Board and (D) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets. The
Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files, furnishes or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(A) any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in the design or
operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company Board any material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to Parent (x) a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee
since October 1, 2008 and (y) any material communication since October 1,
2008

 



17  made by management or the Companys auditors to the audit committee required
or contemplated by listing standards of NASDAQ, the audit committees charter
or professional standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and
"material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Interim Standard AU 325 parts 2 and 3, as
in effect on the date hereof. Since October 1, 2008, no material complaints
from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and no concerns from Company employees regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company. The Company
has made available to Parent a summary of all material complaints or concerns
relating to other matters made since October 1, 2008 through the Companys
whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns
regarding possible violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or
its Subsidiary, whether or not employed by the Company or its Subsidiary,
has reported evidence of a violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary
duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit committee (or
other committee designated for the purpose) of the Company Board or the
Company Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such reporting,
including in instances not required by those rules.

(iv) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary is a party to, nor has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in its published financial
statements or other Company Reports.

 

(v) Each of the balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will
fairly present, the financial position of the Company as of its date and each
of the statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents or, in the case of Company
Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present, the results
of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of the Company for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect); in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _ _GAAP__ ")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein.

 

(vi) Except for (A) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against
on the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiary
as of September 30, 2011 (the " _ _Most Recent Balance Sheet__ "), (B)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, and (C) obligations
incurred pursuant to this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiary
has

 



18  incurred any liability of the type required to be set forth on a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP that, individually or in the aggregate
with other such liabilities, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed
with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) if
required to be filed, the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed
to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein that are based on information
derived from Parents public SEC filings or supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 

(i) Since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiary have conducted their business only in, and have not engaged in any
material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of
such business consistent with past practice.

 

(ii) Since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, there has not occurred:
(A) any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with other
such events, changes, effects, developments, states of fact, conditions,
circumstances or occurrences, has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (B) any material damage, destruction
or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned,
leased or otherwise used by the Company or its Subsidiary, whether or
not covered by insurance; (C) any declaration, accrual, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares of
capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiary, or any repurchase, redemption
or other acquisition by the Company or its Subsidiary of any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or its Subsidiary;
(D) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice or
internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting) by
the Company or its Subsidiary; (E) any (x) increase in the compensation
payable or to become payable to the officers or employees of the Company or
its Subsidiary or (y) payment to any Company director or officer of any
material bonus, making to any Company director or officer of any material
profit-sharing or similar payment, or grant to any Company director or officer
of any rights to receive severance, termination, retention or tax gross-up
compensation or benefits to (in any case except for increases in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice); (F) any establishment,
adoption, entry into, termination or amendment of any 

 



19  collective bargaining, bonus, profit-sharing, thrift, compensation,
employment, termination, severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund,
policy or arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or employee,
except as required by applicable Laws.

(h) _Legal Proceedings_. There is no action, claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity, arbitrator, mediator or other
tribunal (collectively, " _ _Proceedings__ ") pending or, to the knowledge of
the executive officers of Company, threatened, against the Company or its
Subsidiary (other than disputes of a type as may arise from time to time in
the Companys ordinary course of business and which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be material to the Company or its Subsidiary, taken as a
whole). Section 4.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the
date of this Agreement, all Proceedings that the Company or its Subsidiary has
pending or is threatening against other parties and, all Proceedings that are
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company,
threatened against the Company or its Subsidiary. There is no material
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) of any Governmental Entity (an " _ _Order__ ") to which the
Company nor its Subsidiary is subject.

(i) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) All material benefit and compensation plans, Contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees (the " _ _Employees__ "),
current consultants or current or former directors of the Company and its
Subsidiary under which there is a continuing financial obligation of the
Company, including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ _ERISA__ "), and
deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
right, stock based, incentive and bonus plans, severance, retention, change in
control, employment or similar plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
whether written or unwritten (the " _ _Benefit Plans__ "), other than Benefit

Benefit Plans__ "), are listed on Section 4.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and each Benefit Plan which has received a favorable opinion letter
from the IRS has been separately identified. True and complete copies of (i)

(ii) To the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, each Benefit
Plan other than Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (collectively, " _ _U.S. Benefit

of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or has
applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter under Section
401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware

 



20  of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of
such ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. To the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company, neither the Company nor its Subsidiary has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that could subject the
Company or its Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be material.

(iii) No U.S. Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan", within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ "), and neither the
Company nor its Subsidiary has at any time sponsored or contributed to, or has
or had any liability or obligation in respect of, any Multiemployer Plan.

(iv) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary currently maintains or has ever
maintained a "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any other Person that, together
with the Company, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code or any other applicable Law, has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been obligated to sponsor, maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under, any benefit
plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is
otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or is a plan described in Section
3(40) of ERISA or Section 413 of the Code.

 

(v) No Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan as defined under
ERISA Section 3(1) provides benefits to, or on behalf of, any former Employee
after the termination of employment except (A) where the full cost of such
benefit is borne entirely by the former Employee (or his eligible dependents
or beneficiaries) or (B) where the benefit is required by Section 4980B of
the Code.

(vi) No Employee has received or is reasonably expected to receive any
payment or benefit from the Company that would be nondeductible pursuant to

officers of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Benefit Plans,
other than routine claims for benefits.

 

(viii) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(i)(viii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the execution of this Agreement, the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, if applicable, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any
Employee to severance pay or any material increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Benefit Plans or (C) entitle any "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company,
to receive any gross-up payment for any excise tax liability pursuant to
Section 280G or Section 4999 of the Code.

(ix) The Company does not have any Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

 



21 (j) _Legal and Regulatory Compliance_.

 

(i) Since May 2, 2007, the business of the Company and its Subsidiary has not
been, and is not currently being, conducted in violation of any federal,
state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule,
regulation, standard, Order, agency requirement, license or permit of any
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _ _Laws__ "), except for violations
that, individually or in the aggregate with other such violations, have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated
an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which,
individually or in the aggregate with the outcome of other such matters, (x)
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and (y) would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

(ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiary has all permits, licenses,
certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by any
Governmental Entity (" _ _Licenses__ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, including all such Licenses of the United States Food and
Drug Administration (" _ _FDA__ ") or any other applicable U.S. or foreign
drug regulatory authority (collectively with the FDA, " _ _Regulatory
Authorities__ ") necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted
(collectively, the " _ _Regulatory Licenses__ "), except those Licenses the
absence of which, individually or in the aggregate with other such absences,
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions. All such
Regulatory Licenses are valid and in full effect and there has not occurred
any revocation or termination of any Regulatory License, or any material
impairment of the rights of the Company or its Subsidiary under
any Regulatory License, except for any such revocation, termination or
impairment that, individually or in the aggregate with other such revocations,
terminations and impairments, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiary has operated in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Laws administered or enforced by the FDA or any other Regulatory

the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this
Agreement. The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of Parent, Merger

whether express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information

 



32  regarding Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates furnished or
made available to the Company and its representatives except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
shall be subject to any liability to the Company or any other Person resulting
from Parents or Merger Subs making available to the Company or the Companys
use of such information, or any information, documents or material made
available to the Company in any due diligence materials provided to the
Company.

4.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. Except as set
forth in (i) the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
filed with or furnished to the SEC since October 1, 2008 by Parent pursuant
to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (excluding, in each case, any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to
the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature); _provided_ , _however_ , that the exception
provided for in this clause (i) shall be applied with respect to a particular
representation or warranty only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such
representation or warranty or (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered to the
Company by Parent prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _
_Parent Disclosure Schedule__ ") (with each exception set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule being identified by reference to, or grouped under a
heading referring to, a specific individual section or subsection of this
Agreement and relating only to such section or subsection; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a matter disclosed with respect to one representation or
warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to each other
representation or warranty to which the matter disclosed reasonably relates,
but only to the extent that such relationship is reasonably apparent on the
face of the disclosure contained in the Parent Disclosure Schedule), Parent
and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the Company that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not individually or in the aggregate with
other such failures, reasonably be expected to prevent or, materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
commence the Offer or to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case in a timely manner
(a " _ _Parent Material Adverse Effect__ "). Parent has made available to the
Company a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended as of the date hereof, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect.

(b) _Corporate Authority_. The board of directors of each of Parent and
Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions, and no vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power
and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and

 



33  perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, except for the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which Parent covenants to
effect immediately following the execution of this Agreement). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
the Company, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger
Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(c) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

(i) Other than (A) the filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger, (B)
compliance with applicable requirements of the HSR Act or any other
applicable antitrust or competition Law, (C) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and (D) compliance with the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ or FINRA, no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by
Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain, individually or
in the aggregate with other such failures, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation
of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent
or Merger Sub or the comparable governing instruments of any of Parents
Subsidiaries or (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien
on any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
Contracts to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (C) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.2(c)(i), a violation
of any Law to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (D) any
change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses
(B) or (D) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default,
creation or acceleration that, individually or in the aggregate with other
such matters, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, any of the Transactions, except for those that,
individually or in the aggregate with other such Proceedings, have not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(e) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Offer Documents

 



34  or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC,
at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(ii) if required to be filed, the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents based on information derived
from the Companys public SEC filings or supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

(f) _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy of two executed commitment letters, each dated as of November 21,
2011, among Parent and Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated and Barclays Bank PLC (together, the " _ _Lead Commitment
Parties__ " and, together with any person who executes a joinder to such
commitment letters or who otherwise commits to provide any portion of the
Financing (as defined below), " _ _Commitment Parties__ " and, together with
their respective shareholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and agents, the " _ _Financing Sources__ "), which are
attached hereto as Annex D (the " _ _Financing Commitments__ "), pursuant to
which the lenders party thereto severally have committed, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth
therein for the purposes of financing the Transactions (the " _ _Financing__
"). The Financing Commitments have not been amended or modified prior to the
date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained
in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. Except for a fee letter and an agency fee letter relating to fees and
related arrangements with respect to the Financing (true, complete and
correct copies of which has been provided to the Company, with only fee
amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex redacted), as of the
date hereof there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements
altering the terms or conditions of the funding of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are due and
payable on or prior to the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, the
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid,
binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may
be, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and any legal
limitations on the enforceability of provisions requiring indemnification
against liabilities under securities laws in connection with any offering,
sale or issuance of securities, and, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of Parent, each of the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.1 in all material respects (except to the extent already
qualified as to Company Material Adverse Effect), as of the date hereof, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, has
constituted or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
under any of 

 



35  the Financing Commitments by Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of
the executive officers of Parent, any other party thereto. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1 in
all material respects (except to the extent already qualified as to Company
Material Adverse Effect) and assuming compliance by the Company with its
obligations herein in all material respects, Parent and Merger Sub will have
available to them at and immediately prior to the Acceptance Time cash in an
aggregate amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price, assuming all

Effective Time cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Parent and Merger Sub will have at and after the Closing
funds sufficient to pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the
Transactions and the Financing.

(g) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, all
of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Acceptance Time and at
the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant,
right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent
may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and has not engaged in
any business other than those incidental to its formation and pursuant to
this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions.

(h) _No Interested Stockholder_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been within the last three (3) years,
an "interested stockholder" of the Company, in each case as those terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Within the last three (3) years, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates has beneficially owned, directly
or indirectly, any Shares.

(i) _Brokers and Finders_. Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc., there is no investment banker,
broker or finder that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries who would be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions.

(j) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that the only representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements made by the Company or any of its Affiliates or representatives
are the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Company, its Subsidiary or any of their representatives has made any
representation or warranty, whether express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company or its Affiliates
furnished or made available to Parent or Merger Sub and its representatives
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and none of the Company, its
Subsidiary or any other Person shall be subject to any liability to Parent or
Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the Companys making available
to Parent or Merger Sub or Parents or Merger Subs use of such information,
or any information, documents or material made available to Parent or Merger
Sub in any due diligence

 



36  materials provided to Parent or Merger Sub, including in the "data room,"

provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Acquisition
Proposal), (y) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. With respect to any non-public information regarding the
Company provided to any other Person that was not previously provided to
Parent, the Company shall provide such non-public information to Parent
substantially simultaneously with the provision of such information to
such other Person. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis of the status and terms of any Acquisition Proposal (including
any material changes to the key terms thereof) and the general status of any
discussions and negotiations with respect thereto. In addition, during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiary prior to the date of this Agreement, unless the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law.

(b) Subject to Section 5.2(c) and Section 5.2(d), the Company Board shall not:
(i) withhold, fail to include in the Schedule 14D-9, withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal (any such action described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section
5.2(b), a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "); or (iii) cause the Company to
enter into any Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in compliance with Section 5.2(a)) concerning an Acquisition Proposal (an " _
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition

 



42  Proposal and/or cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement concerning such Acquisition Proposal at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time if, and only if: (i) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a material breach of this Section 5.2; (ii) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after
consultation with its financial advisor, (A) that such Acquisition Proposal
would, if this Agreement or the Offer were not amended or an alternative
transaction with Parent were not entered into, constitute a Superior Proposal
and (B) that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to make a
Change of Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) the Company
delivers to Parent a written notice (the " _ _Superior Proposal Notice__ ")
stating that the Company Board intends to take such action and (in the event
the Company Board contemplates causing the Company to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement) including a copy of such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; (iv) during the three (3) Business Day period
commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice,
the Company shall have made its Representatives reasonably available for the
purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or
a possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is
the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal;
(v) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause "(iv)"
above, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and after consultation with its
financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in
writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(iv)"
above, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(B) the failure to make a Change of Recommendation and/or enter into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law; and (vi) if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(f); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of
any amendment to the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver to Parent a new Superior
Proposal Notice (including as attachments thereto a copy of any new
Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to such amended Acquisition
Proposal, if any), and the negotiation period described in clause "(iv)"
above shall be extended by an additional two (2) Business Days from the date
of Parents receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may also make a Change of Recommendation not related to an
Acquisition Proposal at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) an
event, fact, circumstance or occurrence or combination or series thereof, that
was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, becomes
known to the Company Board (an " _ _Intervening Event__ "); (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
(iii) such Change of Recommendation is not effected prior to the third (3rd)
Business Day after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming
that the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Recommendation; (iv)
during such three (3) Business Day

 



43  period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement or the Offer or enter into an
alternative transaction; and (v) at the end of such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in
writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(iv)"
above, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the
Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making accurate disclosure to
the Companys stockholders of any factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of
the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board shall not make a Change of Recommendation except in accordance
with Section 5.2(c) or Section 5.2(d).

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means any proposal, offer, inquiry or indication
of interest, whether written or otherwise, with respect to (i) a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender
offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company, or any
acquisition by any Person, which if consummated would result in any Person
becoming the beneficial owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company, or fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the total assets of the Company, in each case other than the
Transactions, or (ii) any license (whether exclusive or non-exclusive)
pertaining to commercialization rights for the Key Product;  _provided_ that,
no research or development collaborations described in any Material Contract
as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be considered or deemed to be
an Acquisition Proposal.

 

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made
by one or more Persons (none of whom is an Affiliate of the Company)
constituting an Acquisition Proposal that, if consummated, would result in any
person becoming the beneficial owner of (i) a majority of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or (ii) a majority of the
outstanding total voting power of the equity securities of the Company, which
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would result in a transaction
(x) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of
view than the Transactions, taking into account the terms and conditions of
such offer and (y) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account
the material financial, legal and regulatory aspects of such offer; _provided_
, _however_ that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior
Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed or, in the good faith
judgment of the

 



44  Company Board after consultation with its financial advisors, is not
reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

 

5.3 _Stockholders Meeting_.

convene a meeting of the holders of Shares for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote (the " _ _Stockholders Meeting__ ") as promptly as
practicable and shall not postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting unless
the Company determines that it is advisable to do so in order to solicit
additional proxies in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote or to comply

_Proxy Statement__ "). The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply
in all material respects with the applicable Securities Laws. The Company

respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and shall use (and shall

an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the Transactions and (ii) any other necessary filings,
forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with other
Governmental Entities under any applicable antitrust or competition
Laws relating to the Transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of
the information relating to Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with

with a copy of its HSR Act filing or any exhibits thereto.

 

(c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information concerning itself, any of its respective
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement or any other statement,

Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
fact or condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Key Product Event, or would reasonably be
expected to make the satisfaction of any of the Tender Offer Conditions
impossible or unlikely. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
change, fact or

 



46  condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. None of the parties hereto shall independently
participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings or inquiry without giving
the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. The
parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any information or proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any antitrust or competition Laws.

 

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 5.4,
each of the Company (in the case of clause (i)) and Parent (in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)) agrees to take or cause to be taken the following
actions:

 

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable antitrust or competition Laws (" _ _Government Antitrust Entity__
") of non-privileged information and documents requested by any Government
Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the Transactions;

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions, including,
without limitation, the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including,
without limitation, any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such Transactions and
the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease, license
or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and
promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate
of, such assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or
businesses or other operations, or interests therein, of the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with,
and submission to orders of, the relevant Government Antitrust Entity giving
effect thereto) if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of any order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer by
any Government Antitrust Entity; and

(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the
event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry
of any kind that would make consummation of the Offer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer or the other
Transactions, any and all steps (including, without limitation, the appeal
thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by
clause (ii) of this paragraph) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision,

 



47  order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such consummation
on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
not be required to sell, divest, hold separate, license or agree to any other
structural or conduct remedy with respect to, any operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers, assets or relationships of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiary following the
Merger), on the one hand, or the Company or its Subsidiary, on the other hand,
which (A) would materially and adversely affect the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) would require the sale, divestiture,
holding separate or license of the Key Product, PS1-661 or PS1-938 to any
third party or materially impair the benefits expected by Parent as of the
date of this Agreement to be derived by Parent from the acquisition of the
Key Product, PS1-661 or PS1-938 (any such action, a " _ _Non-Required
Remedy__ ").

(g) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company (acting through the Company
Board and its compensation committee) shall take such actions as may be
required to cause any agreements, arrangements or understandings that have
been or will be entered into by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees
of the Company pursuant to which payments are made or to be made or benefits
are granted or to be granted according to such arrangements to be approved as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning or Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
under the Exchange Act.

5.5 _Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiary to) afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, assets,
books, Contracts, Tax Returns, and records, and, during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiary to) furnish promptly to Parent
all information concerning its business, properties, finances, operations,
assets, litigation matters, environmental compliance, cash-flow reports and
personnel as may reasonably be requested. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be directed to the executive officer or
other persons designated by the Company. All such information shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.5 or by Parent or its Representatives at any time
prior to or following the date hereof shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, the covenants or
agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto under this Agreement.

(b) This Section 5.5 shall not require the Company or its Subsidiary to permit
any access, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable, good
faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel) of the Company,
would reasonably be expected to result in any violation of any Law or any
Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiary is a party or cause any
privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or its
Subsidiary would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such
information and such

 



48  undermining of such privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment
(after consultation with outside counsel) adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys position in any pending or, what the Company believes
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties
in a litigation, any information that is reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided_ , that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company
(after consultation with outside counsel)) reasonably be expected to result in
the violation of any such Law or Contract or reasonably be expected to cause
such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with
outside counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room"
arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of Parent could
be provided access to such information.

(c) The information provided pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be used
solely for the purpose of the Transactions, and such information shall be kept
confidential by Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with, and shall otherwise
be subject to the terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

5.6 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to no longer be quoted on NASDAQ
and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time.

 

5.7 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Transactions shall be
a joint press release by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, provided that
the Company Board shall not have made a Change of Recommendation, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each shall consult with the other prior to issuing any
press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service) with respect thereto, except (i) in any case in which the
management of any such party hereto shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service
or by the request of any Governmental Entity or (ii) in any case in which such
disclosure is made in connection with any dispute between the parties hereto
regarding this Agreement or the Transactions.

5.8 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiary who continue
to be employed by Parent or an Affiliate following the Acceptance Time (" _
_Continuing Employees__ ") shall be provided with (i) base salary or wage
rate and bonus opportunities (including annual bonus opportunities, but
excluding equity-based compensation) that are no less than the base salary or
wage rate and bonus opportunities provided by the Company or its Subsidiary,
as applicable, immediately prior

 



49  to the Acceptance Time, (ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (iii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in Section
5.8(a) the Company Disclosure Schedule. Following the Effective Time,
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the equity
compensation plans of Parent on the same terms as similarly situated Parent
employees (including with respect to the grant of any awards (to be made at
the discretion of Parents board of directors) under such equity
compensation plans and the terms and conditions of such awards). Parent shall
have no obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the
effect of requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause any employee benefit plans in which the
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time
to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits
and benefit accrual thereunder, service by such employees to the Company or
its Subsidiary, as applicable, as if such service were with Parent, to the
same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company
or its Subsidiary, as applicable (provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits).

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, with respect to any employee
benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following
the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto, to (i) cause there to be
waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or
waiting period requirements to the same extent waived under comparable plans
of the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, amounts paid by such employees during the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs under similar plans maintained by the Company or
its Subsidiary, as applicable.

(d) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor
thereto to, honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys obligations under the
agreements identified in Section 5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) If directed in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Parent
to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any Employee Plans that contain a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code.

(f) Regardless of the calendar year in which the Acceptance Time occurs, the
Company and its Subsidiary, as applicable, shall pay to each eligible
Employee, immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, a pro rata bonus for the
Companys 2012 fiscal year in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Employees 2012 fiscal year target bonus, _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the ratio of
such Employees actual bonus received for the Companys 2011 fiscal year to
the Employees target bonus for the Companys 2011 fiscal year, _multiplied_
  _by_ (z) the ratio of the number of calendar days elapsed between October
1, 2011 and the Acceptance Time to 365 days.

 



50 (g) The provisions contained in this Section 5.8 are included for the sole
benefit of the Company and Parent and nothing in this Section 5.8, whether
express or implied, shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any current or former employees,
any participant in any Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof,
(ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the
ability to terminate any Benefit Plans or benefit plan or agreement of Parent
or (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee at any time.

 

5.9 _Expenses_. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article III. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, whether or not Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by the party hereto incurring such expense.

5.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, each present and former director and officer of the Company or
its Subsidiary (in each case, when acting in such capacity) determined as of
the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against any and all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred
in connection with any Proceeding arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, including the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions; and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance to the Indemnified Parties all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
in such Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
_provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.10(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) to pay for
only

 



51  one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless
the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified
Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the
Company) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Acceptance Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as the Companys existing policies existing or occurring
at or prior to the Acceptance Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such "tail" insurance policies shall not require the payment
of an aggregate premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof to maintain the DandO Insurance. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Acceptance
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as that provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such DandO Insurance or comparable DandO Insurance
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the DandO
Insurance.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is an intended
third-party beneficiary of this

 



52  Agreement. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Section 5.10
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.10 applies unless
(i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the
affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination
or modification.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of
the Company or its Subsidiary, or under any applicable Contracts or applicable
Law. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that the Charter and Bylaws shall
contain provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of directors no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties (and
employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiary to the fullest
extent indemnification and advancement of expenses are afforded to such
persons under the Companys and its Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or comparable governing documents) than such provisions as are
presently contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiary.

5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or may become applicable
to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company Board shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and shall otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such Transactions. 

5.12 _Parent Vote_. If a Stockholders Meeting is held, Parent shall vote or
cause to be voted any Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the
power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted, in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the Company at
which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all adjournments
or postponements thereof. From and after the Acceptance Time until the
Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates shall at all times
maintain ownership of Shares equal to at least a majority of the then
outstanding Shares.

5.13  _Financing_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing or any Alternate Financing
is not a condition to consummation of the Transactions, and that, irrespective
and independently of the availability of the Financing or any Alternate
Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be obligated to pay for the tendered
Shares and consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as provided
herein, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions
or the conditions set forth in Article VI, as applicable. 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on
the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, shall not, until after the Effective Time, permit, effect

 



53  or cause to be effected any voluntary or mandatory termination, prepayment
or reduction in the aggregate amount of the Financing or the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments, and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver by Parent or Merger Sub
of any provision or remedy under the Financing Commitments if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Financing) or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate with other such
amendments, modifications or waivers, would reasonably be expected to (A) have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) delay or make the funding of
the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing)
less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto; _it_ _being_
_understood_ _and_ _agreed_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this sentence, Parent or Merger Sub may reduce (through voluntary or
mandatory terminations or otherwise) the aggregate amount of the Financing in
connection with any cash received by Parent or Merger Sub from other sources
(including by reason of a capital market or other financing transaction) that
is available to satisfy the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.2(f), Parent and
Merger Sub may replace or amend the Financing Commitments to add agents, co-
agents, lenders, arrangers, joint bookrunners, managers or other entities
that have not executed the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate with
other such additions, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or
impair the availability of the financing under the Financing Commitments or
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (u) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments until the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions are consummated, (v) satisfy (or have waived) all conditions and
covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Financing Commitments at
or prior to the Acceptance Time or the Closing, as applicable, and otherwise
comply with their obligations under the Financing Commitments, (w) enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on the terms
and subject to the conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by
the Financing Commitments, (x) enforce their rights under the Financing
Commitments, including any rights to cause the Financing Sources and other
Persons providing, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, the
Financing to fund, on the day of the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions, as applicable, the Financing contemplated to be funded
on such day by the Financing Commitments (or such lesser amount as may be
required to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions) and
(y) consummate the Financing at or prior to consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions, as applicable. Parent and Merger Sub shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or replacement thereof)
as the Company may reasonably request, and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any development with respect to the Financing that would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that in no
event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if
Parent and Merger Sub shall have used their reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

 



54 (i) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and subject to
the conditions that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent
(taking into account the flex provisions set forth in the Financing
Commitments) than those set forth in the Financing Commitments, in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.

(ii) Parent shall have the right from time to time to substitute other debt
or equity financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
and/or alternative financing source, in each case, in a manner not materially
less beneficial to the Company, Parent and Merger Sub as compared to the
Financing Commitments (and no less beneficial in terms of confidentiality or
the aggregate amount of funds available under the Financing); provided,
however, that any such financing arranged in accordance with this Section
5.13(b)(ii) shall be subject to the same limitations that apply to the
Financing Commitments as set forth in the first sentence of this Section
5.13(b). For purposes of this Agreement: (A) any financing arranged in
accordance with Section 5.13(b)(i) above or this Section 5.13(b)(ii) shall be
referred to as the " _ _Alternate Financing__ "; (B) the term "Financing"
shall be deemed to include the debt financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this Section 5.13(b)
and/or any Alternate Financing; and (C) the term "Financing Commitments" shall
be deemed to include such Financing Commitments as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 5.13(b) and/or any new commitment letter (the " _
_New Financing Commitments__ ") entered into with respect to any Alternate
Financing (it being understood and agreed that any Alternate Financing shall
be subject to the terms and conditions hereof that apply to Financing
Commitments). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with a copy of
any New Financing Commitments obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with an Alternate Financing as promptly as practicable following the
execution thereof (other than fees and other information customarily redacted
from such agreements).

 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiary to) provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiary to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, all cooperation reasonably requested in
writing by Parent and Merger Sub that is necessary in connection with
the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to, in each case to
the extent reasonably requested: (i) cooperate with the marketing efforts of
Parent and lenders for any of the Financing, including using reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to be available, during normal working
hours and upon reasonable notice, to participate in meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and
using its reasonable best efforts to ensure that any syndication effort
benefits from any existing banking relationship; (ii) assist with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, road
show presentations and similar documents necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the Financing; (iii) provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause Representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiary to provide to Parent and Merger Sub all financial information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiary required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 2 of Exhibit B of the Financing Commitments or required in connection
with 

 



55  the preparation of the Offering Documents referred to in Section 8 of
Exhibit B of the Financing Commitments; (iv) obtain consent from its certified
independent auditors to SEC filings and offering memoranda that include or
incorporate Company consolidated financial information (with such changes as
the Company and its auditors deem necessary or appropriate), in each case, to
the extent such consent is required, together with auditors reports and
comfort letters with respect to financial information relating to the Company
and its Subsidiary in customary form; (v) provide information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiary reasonably required to assist in the preparation
of pro forma financial statements by Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ that it
is understood that assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to be made
are the sole responsibility of Parent and/or Merger Sub; (vi)
provide assistance in the preparation of definitive financing documents and
providing any sources of Financing (subject to confidentiality) with
reasonable access to the properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiary; (vii) provide other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiary reasonably required by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
preparation of the Offering Document referred to in Section 8 of Exhibit B of
the Financing Commitments (it being understood that preparation of the
Offering Document is the responsibility of Parent and Merger Sub); (viii)
provide reasonable cooperation with the Financing Sources, other potential
financing sources and their respective agents with respect to their due
diligence, including access to documentation reasonably requested by persons
in connection with capital markets transactions; and (ix) provide all
documentation and other information required by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, and in any event
at least five (5) days prior to the Acceptance Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) no obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary under any
certificate, document or instrument executed pursuant to the foregoing shall
be effective until the Acceptance Time (or such later time set forth in such
certificate, document or instrument), and neither the Company nor its
Subsidiary nor any of its respective Representatives shall be required to take
any action under any such certificate, document or instrument that is not
contingent upon the consummation of the Offer (including the entry into any
agreement that is effective before consummation of the Offer) or that would be
effective prior thereto, (B) nothing herein shall require cooperation to the
extent that such cooperation would interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiary and (C) neither the Company nor
its Subsidiary shall be required to issue any offering or information
document. The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the syndication or marketing
of the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to harm or disparage the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that such logos are used solely in connection with
a description of the Company, its business and products or the Transactions
and shall not appear on the cover of any rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses, road show presentations and similar documents used in connection
with the Financing. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary shall be required
to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Acceptance Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiary in connection with such cooperation
and indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiary and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all costs or
expenses (including reasonable

 



56  attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of the arrangement of the Financing (including any
action taken in accordance with this Section 5.13(c)) and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information and other
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiary provided by the Company
in writing specifically for use in the Financing offering documents). Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiary in
connection with this Section 5.13(c).

5.14 _Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt notice of, and
copies of all pleadings and correspondence relating to, any Proceeding against
the Company or any of its directors or officers by any holder of Shares
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement,
or compromise of any such Proceeding, and no such settlement or compromise
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of
this paragraph "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised
of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
Proceeding by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected),
and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the Proceeding
but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the
Proceeding except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 

5.15 _Rights Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time and the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiary not to, enter
into any stockholder rights agreement, rights plan, "poison pill" or other
similar agreement, unless such plan or agreement exempts from its application
the acquisition of Shares by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement,
the Offer and the Merger.

5.16 _Payoff Letters_.

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Acceptance
Time, the Company shall deliver a notice of termination in accordance with
Section 2.3(b) of the Venture Loan and Security Agreement (the " _ _Loan
Agreement__ ") to Horizon Technology Funding Company V LLC and CIT
Healthcare, LLC under the Loan Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) either (A) terminate or otherwise cause the release of the
Liens securing the Loan Agreements or (B) obtain a customary payoff letter
from the lenders under the Loan Agreement (and other outstanding indebtedness
for borrowed money, if any) which (1) confirms the full outstanding amount
then outstanding, along with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations of the Company accrued under the Loan Agreement (or such other
indebtedness) (the " _ _Payoff Amount__ "), (2) contains payment instructions,
and (3) evidences the agreement by such lenders to release all Liens upon the
payment of such amount in accordance with the payment instructions, and (ii)
obtain documents, including an authorization to file UCC termination

 



57  statements, executed terminations and releases of outstanding mortgages, as
are reasonably necessary to release such Liens.

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall repay the Payoff Amount to

ARTICLE VII

_TERMINATION_

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before June 30, 2012 (the " _ _Outside Date__ "); _provided_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to any party hereto that has breached its obligations
under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the primary cause of
the failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred prior to the Outside Date;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if any Order permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the making or the consummation of the

58  Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be
available to any party hereto that has breached its obligations under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have been the primary cause of the
existence of such Order;

(d) by Parent, (i) if the Company Board shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation or if, following the public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal or the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for the
Shares, the Company Board shall have failed to publicly confirm the Company
Recommendation (and, in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, failed
to publicly recommend that the holders of Shares reject such tender offer or
exchange offer) upon Parents written request within ten (10) Business Days
after the Companys receipt of any such request (or, in the case of a tender
offer or exchange offer, such commencement) (or, if the Outside Date is
fewer than ten (10) Business Days after the Companys receipt of such request
from Parent or, in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, such
commencement, by the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Outside Date), or (ii) if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement or any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue or
incorrect on any date subsequent to the date hereof, in any such case in a
manner that will cause any Tender Offer Condition not to be satisfied at any
scheduled Expiration Time, and such breach or failure to be true or correct
either is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier
of (x) the Outside Date and (y) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after
written notice thereof has been given by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company;

 

(e) by the Company, (i) if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement or any such representation, or warranty shall have become untrue or
incorrect on any date subsequent to the date hereof, which breach or failure
to perform has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect and is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured
prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the thirtieth (30th)
calendar day after written notice thereof has been given by the Company to
Parent or Merger Sub; or (ii) if Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer on or
prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date hereof or if Merger
Sub fails to consummate the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; or

 

(f) by the Company, in connection with the Company Boards effecting a Change
of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or causing the Company
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning a Superior
Proposal if the Company and the Company Board shall have complied in all
material respects with the notice, negotiation and other requirements set
forth in Section 5.2(c) with respect to such Superior Proposal.

Any party hereto desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections
7.1(b) through 7.1(f) shall give written notice of such termination to the
other parties hereto, and the date and time on which written notice of such
termination is delivered shall be the " _ _Termination Date__."

 



59 7.2 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Termination Fee_. 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Article VII, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect, with no liability to any Person on the part of
any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of
any liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful
and intentional breach of this Agreement, _it_ _being_ _acknowledged_ _and_
_agreed_ that the failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions after the respective conditions thereto
have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement, and (ii) the provisions set forth in this Section
7.2 and the second sentence of Section 8.1 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and intentional
breach" means a material breach or failure to perform that is a consequence
of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be
expect to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

(b) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i) or 7.1(f), then:

(A) the Company shall pay to Parent, within two (2) Business Days
following the date of such termination, all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses of Parent and Merger Sub incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, not to exceed $10,000,000 (the " _
_Expense Reimbursement__ "); and

(B) if, within one (1) year following such termination, the Company
consummates a Subsequent Transaction, the Company shall pay to Parent, no
later than two (2) Business Days following the date of such consummation, a
termination fee equal to $331,900,000 (the " _ _Termination Fee__ "), _minus_
the Expense Reimbursement paid.

(ii) In the event that (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known
to the Company Board or shall have been publicly announced (and such
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been unconditionally terminated or
withdrawn at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date), (B)
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b), and (C) prior to the date that is 12 months after the date of
any such termination, the Company or its Subsidiary consummates a Subsequent
Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent, no later than two (2)
Business Days following the date of such consummation, the Termination Fee.
Solely for purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(ii), the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 5.2(f) except that all references to "fifteen percent (15%) or more"
therein shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

 

(iii) As used in this Agreement, " _ _Subsequent Transaction__ " means (i) a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company,
or any acquisition by any Person, which results in any Person becoming the
beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power of

 



60  the equity securities of the Company or fifty percent (50%) or more of the
total assets of the Company, in each case other than the Transactions, or (ii)
any license (whether exclusive or non-exclusive) pertaining to
commercialization rights for the Key Product. In any situation where this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or 7.1(f) or the
Company is required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
7.2(b), Parents right to receive the Expense Reimbursement and/or the
Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Representatives for any and
all losses and damages suffered in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions or as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated. The agreements contained in this Section 7.2(b) are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without these
agreements none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would enter into this
Agreement. Payment of the Expense Reimbursement and/or the Termination Fee, as
the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds if Parent shall have furnished to the Company appropriate wire payment
instructions prior to the date of payment or, otherwise, by certified or
official bank check. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Expense Reimbursement or the Termination Fee more than once.

(c) If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under Section
7.2(b), then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of outside
legal counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue
amount and the enforcement by Parent of its rights under this Section 7.2, and
(ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of
America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such amount was
originally required to be paid.

Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Sections 5.8 (Employee Benefits),
5.9 (Expenses) and 5.10 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance)
shall survive the consummation of the Merger. This Article VIII and the
agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.9
(Expenses) and Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination and Abandonment;
Termination Fee) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. None of the other representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of
the Merger or the termination of this Agreement.

8.2 _Amendment; Extension; Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time
by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto, _provided_ , _that_
Sections 8.2, 8.4, 8.6 and 8.7, which Sections (and the related definitions
and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or waiver
or termination would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such
Sections) may not be amended or modified in any manner adverse to any
Financing Source without the Lead Commitment Parties prior written consent
(such consent not to be

 



61  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand and the
Company, on the other hand, may (but shall not be under any obligation to)
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements of
the other or any of the conditions for its benefit contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party.
The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder or under
applicable Law shall not constitute a waiver of such rights and, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or partial exercise by any
party hereto of any of its rights hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder or under
applicable Law.

8.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission (such as via
portable document format (.pdf)) shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart.

8.4 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court of Chancery
shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal courts of the United
States of America located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any
claim or cause of action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this
Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and
the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such
action or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in such courts.
The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 8.5 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim, action or
proceeding against the Financing Sources arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the
Financing, or the performance of

 



62  services by the Financing Sources with respect to the foregoing, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within
such State (provided, however, that, for purposes of the foregoing, (i) the
interpretation of the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" (and
whether or not a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred) and (ii) the
determination of the accuracy of any representations and warranties of the
Company herein and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof the Parent or
Merger Sub have the right to terminate its (or their) obligations under this
Agreement, in each case shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law), and shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of New York State or United States federal courts sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan, City of New York and no party hereto shall, nor shall it
permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or support anyone else in bringing
any claim, action or proceeding against the Financing Sources in relation
hereto in any other court.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT; INCLUDING ANY
LITIGATION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
FINANCING COMMITMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(iii) EACH PARTY HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY

THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.4.

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable damage would likewise occur
if any of the Transactions were not consummated and the Companys stockholders
did not receive the aggregate consideration payable to them in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement), and, accordingly,
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligation of the
parties hereto to consummate the Transactions and the obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub to pay, and the Companys stockholders right to receive, the
aggregate consideration payable to them pursuant to the Transactions, in each
case in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if said Court
of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, any Federal court of the
United States of America located in the County of New

 



63  Castle, Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action is brought
in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall
allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that
there is an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto further agrees that no
other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish,
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.4(c), and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

(d) Each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its stockholders,
Affiliates and Representatives, that the Financing Sources shall be

failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder.

 

8.9 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not

circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or

8.10 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. For the convenience of
the parties hereto, each of the terms set forth in the table following the
table of contents is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth
opposite such term. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to an Article,
Section or Annex, such reference shall be to such Article or Section of, or
Annex to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The Company Disclosure
Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Annexes identified in this
Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and made a part
hereof. The terms " _include_ ," " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are not
intended to be limiting and shall be deemed to be followed by the words "
_without limitation_ " or words of like import. The use of the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender, or the singular or plural form of words used
herein (including defined terms) shall not limit any provision of this
Agreement. Reference herein to a particular Person includes such Persons
successors and assigns to the extent such successors and assigns
are permitted by the terms of any applicable Contract. Reference to a
particular Contract (including this Agreement), document or instrument means
such Contract, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Any reference to a
particular Law means such Law as amended, modified or supplemented (including
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and, unless otherwise
provided, as in effect from time to time. The terms " _cash_ ", " _dollars_ "
and " _$_ " mean United States Dollars. The use of the terms " _hereunder_ ,"
" _hereof_ ," " _hereto_ " and words of similar import shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section, paragraph or
clause of, or Annex to, this Agreement. Except as provided in Section
4.1(p)(ix), the Company shall be deemed to have "made available" a document
or item of information to Parent only if such document or item was actually
delivered by the Company to Parent or its legal counsel or publicly filed in
unredacted form with the SEC prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or was, prior to the execution and delivery of this

 



66  Agreement, posted in the electronic data room organized by the Company in
connection with the due diligence investigation conducted by Parent.

 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

(c) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order
shall be construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

8.11 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assignable by any of the
parties hereto (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or
indirect Delaware Subsidiary of Parent, with a certificate of incorporation
and bylaws identical (other than the corporate name) to the correlative
instruments of Merger Sub as in effect on the date hereof, in which case all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed to be to such other
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such designation shall not
impede or delay the commencement or consummation of the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in violation
of this Agreement is void.

  ANNEX A

_TENDER OFFER CONDITIONS_

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Offer, Merger
Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment or, subject to the rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act
relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return the tendered Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer, pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, if at any time on or
after the date of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the Expiration
Time, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing at the then
scheduled Expiration Time:

(i) there shall not be validly tendered (not including Shares tendered
pursuant to procedures for guaranteed delivery and not actually delivered
prior to the Expiration Time) and not properly withdrawn a number of Shares
that, together with the Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitute at least a majority of the total number of then outstanding Shares
on a fully diluted basis (which total number shall be the number of
Shares issued and outstanding _plus_ the number of Shares which the Company
would be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options,
benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into
Shares or otherwise) (the " _ _Minimum Tender Condition__ ");

(ii) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired
or been terminated;

(iii) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Time (in each
case, except for any representation or warranty that is expressly made as of a
specified date, in which case as of such specified date), (A) any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct
in all respects, (B) any representation or warranty of the Company contained
in Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(b), Section 4.1(c) or Section 4.1(t) shall not
be true and correct in all respects, or (C) any other representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement that is not qualified as
to Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct in all
respects except where the failure of such representations and warranties
referred to in this clause (C) to be true and correct, individually or in the
aggregate with other such failures, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of determining the accuracy of representations and
warranties referred to in clause (C), all qualifications as to "materiality"
contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded;

 

(iv) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects those
obligations under this Agreement required to be performed prior to the
Expiration Time, and such failure to perform shall not have been cured prior
to the Expiration Time;

(v) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
an officer of the Company and certifying as to the satisfaction of the
conditions described in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above;

 



A-1  (vi) there shall be in effect an Order by a court of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer or
making the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer illegal or compelling
Parent or Merger Sub to agree to or implement a Non-Required Remedy; 

(vii) there shall be pending, or threatened in writing, any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity having authority over Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the acquisition of or payment
for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the
Merger or compelling Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to agree to or implement a Non-Required Remedy; or

(viii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The foregoing conditions (except for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be
waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time, subject in each case to the terms of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to the assertion of any such conditions and may be waived (to the
extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law) by Parent or Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion (except for the Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to
the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Annex A
shall have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere in the Agreement to which
this Annex A is attached.
