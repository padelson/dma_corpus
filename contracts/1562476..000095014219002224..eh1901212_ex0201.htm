ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER

  

1.1 _The Merger_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a Subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section
251 of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, (i) the certificate of
incorporation of the

  

  

 

-2-  

  

Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
and restated to read in its entirety in the form of the certificate of
incorporation set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to _Section 5.9_ ), and (ii) the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to read
in their entirety in the form of the bylaws set forth on _Exhibit B_ and, as
so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and in the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and by applicable Law (subject
to _Section 5.9_ ).

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the Company or Parent
shall occur as a result of any reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Shares) with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and provide the holders
of each Company Share and Company Equity Award the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable
conditions set forth in _Article __6_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) (the " _Closing
Date_ "), by electronic exchange of documents, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article __6_ (other
than those conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing),
the Closing shall occur instead on (a) the earlier to occur of (i) such
Business Day during the Marketing Period as shall be specified by Parent to
the Company in writing not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
third (3rd) Business Day prior to such date, and (ii) the third (3rd) Business
Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (as it may be
extended pursuant to the definition of " _Marketing Period_ "); or (b) such
other date and time as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly
as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, or such other date and time to
which Merger Sub and the Company may agree in writing, the Company shall cause
a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the
Company and Merger Sub shall make all other filings required under the DGCL in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

  

 

-3-  

  

1.3 _Governance Matters_.

  

(a) Parent and the Parent Board shall take all actions necessary such that,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Parent Board shall include two (2)
individuals who are currently members of the Company Board and are mutually
selected by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Designees_ "). Prior to the next annual meeting of Parent stockholders
following the Effective Time (the " _Annual Meeting_ "), Parent shall take all
necessary action to cause the Parent Board to nominate the Company Designees
for election at the Annual Meeting, subject to applicable Law (including
fiduciary duties of the members of the Parent Board).

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, or such other individuals designated by Parent as
of the Effective Time, shall become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

  

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Restricted
Stock Award, any Dissenting Share and any Cancelled Share, shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) 0.8000 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Shares (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) $2.50 in
cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the
Stock Consideration, collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with _Section 2.2_ , including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.7_
, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which such Company
Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ (the " _Dividend Consideration_ ").

  

  

 

-4-  

  

(b) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

  

(c) _Cancelled Shares_. Each Company Share that is owned directly by the
Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

  

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as the exchange agent
(the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be
subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Shares issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate number
of Parent Shares included in the Stock Consideration (excluding any fractional
Parent Shares to which holders of Company Shares are entitled in accordance
with this Agreement), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash included in the Cash
Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration (such evidence of Parent
Shares in book-entry form and cash amounts, including any Dividend
Consideration, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of
the holders of Company Shares. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make
delivery of the Merger Consideration and any Fractional Share Consideration
and Dividend Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to
pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause
Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional Parent Shares or cash in
immediately available funds, as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an
amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or Merger
Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to
the holders of the Company Shares; _provided_ that, unless otherwise agreed by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, any such investments shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any agency
or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1
or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks

  

  

 

-5-  

  

with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub,
and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company
Shares.

  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

  

(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Company Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which
Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably
agree upon (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ ) in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and
instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ ) to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by
Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in
proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable,
for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_ ), and
any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable,
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered
and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this
Agreement, except for Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall
represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company, an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company
whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, shall upon the Effective Time, in accordance
with The Depository Trust Company's customary procedures (including receipt by
the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" (or such other evidence of transfer
or surrender as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)) and such other
procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent and The
Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through
it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each
such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, for each such
Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_ ) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person
that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-
Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter of
Transmittal and (B) instructions for returning such Letter of Transmittal in
exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and
the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, the forms of which Letter of
Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such Letter of
Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable,
for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_ ), and such Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until
paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be
deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the
extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of
Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares

  

  

 

-7-  

  

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2_. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article __2_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Shares, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting
Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or any other valid
evidence of ownership of Company Shares that have not previously been
surrendered are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable,
as provided in this Agreement.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of
the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the
Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_
prior to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of
the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, in each case without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder's
surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration, Fractional Share
Consideration or Dividend Consideration, as applicable, remaining unclaimed by
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Exchange Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent or affiliate of any of them, shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration made available
to the Exchange Agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit, in customary form, reasonably acceptable to Parent
(which shall contain an agreement in customary form to indemnify Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective affiliates against
any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective affiliates on account of the alleged loss,
theft or destruction of such Certificates) of that fact by the holder thereof,
the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend
Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ , without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law. In

  

  

 

-8-  

  

addition, Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, Fractional Share
Consideration and Dividend Consideration, as applicable, require the owner(s)
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a
customary and reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. Subject to the
provisions of _Section 1.1(c)_ , no dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with
respect to the Parent Shares issuable to such holder hereunder, and all such
dividends and other distributions, if any, shall be paid by Parent to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of such
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws and the provisions
of _Section 1.1(c)_ , following surrender of any such Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_
) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time and with a payment date prior to such surrender
with respect to the Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

  

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_ ), Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal
for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration or the Dividend Consideration. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to
them under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and shall be
exchangeable for, subject to compliance with the procedures in _Section
2.2(b)_ , solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and
as required by applicable Law.

  

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to
purchase a Company Share granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or not
exercisable) that is outstanding and unexercised

  

  

 

-9-  

  

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be substituted and converted at
the Effective Time, by Parent granting an option in substitution of such
Company Stock Option under the Parent Equity Plan (each, a " _Parent Stock
Option_ ") to purchase (A) a number of whole Parent Shares (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and (B) at
an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per Company Share of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, it being understood that the exercise price and the
number of Parent Shares for which each substituted Company Stock Option is
exercisable is intended to be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 2.4(a)_
, each Parent Stock Option issued pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and acceleration
of vesting terms and conditions as, and other terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each
reference to the Company shall be deemed to be a reference to Parent.

  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each award
in respect of a Company Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted
Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be substituted and converted at the Effective Time, by Parent granting
an award of restricted Parent Shares in substitution of such Company
Restricted Stock Award under the Parent Equity Plan (a " _Parent Restricted
Stock Award_ ") consisting of a number of whole Parent Shares (rounded to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions
applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award for any performance period
that has not been completed as of the Effective Time are achieved at target)
and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise set forth in
this _Section 2.4(b)_ , each Parent Restricted Stock Award issued pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any
performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that
are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Company
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
each reference to the Company shall be deemed to be a reference to Parent.

  

(c) _Company PSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each performance stock
unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a Company Equity Plan
(each, a " _Company PSU Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options
and the Company Restricted Stock Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be substituted
and converted at the Effective Time, by Parent granting a restricted stock
unit award to be settled in Parent Shares in substitution of such Company PSU
Award under the Parent Equity Plan (a " _Parent RSU Award_ ") corresponding to
a number of whole Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product of (i) the number of

  

  

 

-10-  

  

Company Shares underlying such Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions
applicable to such Company PSU Award for any performance period that has not
been completed as of the Effective Time are achieved at target) and (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
2.4(c)_ , each Parent RSU Award issued pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and acceleration
of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting
conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially similar
to, those that applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that each reference to the Company shall
be deemed a reference to Parent.

  

(d) _Class B Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the warrant held by
Lyon Shareholder 2012, LLC (the " _Class B Warrant_ ") shall be substituted
and converted at the Effective Time, by Parent issuing a warrant to be settled
in Parent Shares in substitution of the Class B Warrant exercisable for (A) a
number of whole Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Company Shares
subject to the Class B Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and (B) at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the exercise price per Company Share of the Class B Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. The Parent
warrant issued pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_.

  

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay, through the Surviving Corporation's
standard payroll procedures, the cash amounts described in this _Section 2.4_
, less applicable Tax withholdings, on the next regularly scheduled payroll
date that is at least five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date;
_provided_ that, if any such payment cannot be made through such payroll
system, then the Surviving Corporation shall issue a check for such payment
promptly following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, to the extent that payment of the amounts described in this _Section
2.4_ with respect to Company Equity Awards that constitute nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code would otherwise
cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payment at the
earliest time permitted under the Company Equity Plan and applicable award
agreement that would not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty.

  

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_.

  

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Parent Board or the
compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.4_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations
of the Company with respect to the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Stock Awards and Company PSU Awards that are converted into Parent Stock
Options, Parent Restricted Stock Awards and Parent RSU Awards, respectively,
and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereof. Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary

  

  

 

-11-  

  

to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon
the exercise, vesting or settlement of the Parent Stock Options, Parent
Restricted Stock Awards and Parent RSU Awards in accordance with this _Section
2.4_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to
the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of Parent Shares to be
registered and issuable under the awards described in this _Section 2.4_ ,
Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to the Parent Shares subject to such awards and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such awards remain outstanding.

  

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except (i) with respect to amounts payable with
respect to Company Restricted Stock Awards, (ii) with respect to amounts
otherwise treated as compensation for Tax purposes or (iii) as a result of the
failure of any holder of Company Shares to provide applicable Tax
documentation to the Exchange Agent that shows a valid exemption from
withholding, before making any such deduction or withholding, to the extent
reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide the Company notice of any
applicable payor's intention to make such deduction or withholding and provide
the Company with a reasonable opportunity to obtain reduction of or relief
from such deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

2.6 _Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender of any right
thereto, cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent and without interest, in an
amount equal to such

  

  

 

-12-  

  

fraction, multiplied by the Closing VWAP. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time and the determination of the aggregate Fractional Share
Consideration, the Exchange Agent shall make available the Fractional Share
Consideration to such holders, subject to and in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

  

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed on or after January
1, 2017 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (other than any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements," and any other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature but, for the purpose of clarification, including and
giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any such
statements), but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be
applicable to _Sections_ _3.2(a)_ , _3.2(b)_ or _3.2(c)_ , or (ii) the
corresponding sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that
disclosure in any Section or Subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all
other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly organized and validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of Delaware and has requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except for such failures to be in
good standing or to have such power that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company's Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the
requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, in each case, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its "significant
subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities
Act) (each, a " _Significant Company Subsidiary_ ") is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Third Amended
and Restated

  

  

 

-13-  

  

Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments to the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents,
of each Significant Company Subsidiary. The Company is in compliance in all
material respects with the provisions of the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws.

  

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the
date hereof a true, correct and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries,
together with the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case
may be, of each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns any Equity Interest in any Person
other than the Company Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Except as
set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each
Company Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

  

3.2 _Capitalization_.

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 150,000,000
Company Class A Shares, of which, as of the close of business on November 1,
2019 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), there were 33,983,093 Company Class A
Shares outstanding (including 954,067 Company Class A Shares underlying
Company Restricted Stock Awards and excluding 0 Company Shares held in
treasury), (ii) 30,000,00 Company Class B Shares, of which, as of the

outstanding and (iii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as of
the Capitalization Date, no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding. No Company Subsidiary owns any Company Shares or has any option
or warrant to purchase any Company Shares or any other Equity Interest in the
Company. All of the outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

  

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has no
Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved for
issuance, except for (i) 545,590 Company Class A Shares subject to outstanding
Company Stock Options under the Company Equity Plans, (ii) 463,728 Company
Class A Shares subject to outstanding Company PSU Awards (assuming vesting at
target performance levels with respect to each Company PSU Award that is
subject to performance-based vesting), (iii) 316,283 Company Class A Shares
reserved for future issuance under the Company Equity Plans for awards not yet
granted and (iv) 1,907,550 Company Class B Shares issuable upon the exercise
of the Class B Warrant. All Company Shares subject to issuance under the
Company Equity Plans and the Class B Warrant, upon issuance prior to the
Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

  

  

 

-14-  

  

(c) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, other than the
Company Equity Awards, the Class B Warrant and the preemptive rights set forth
in the Company Charter, there are no outstanding Equity Interests or other
options, warrants or other rights, relating to or based on the value of any
Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or sell any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since the close of
business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has not issued any Company
Shares, Company Equity Awards or other Equity Interests (including shares of
Company Preferred Stock) other than Company Shares issued upon the exercise or
settlement of Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the close of business on
the Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms.

  

(d) Other than the Company Equity Awards, the Class B Warrant and the
preemptive rights set forth in the Company Charter, there are no obligations
(whether outstanding or authorized) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
requiring the redemption or repurchase of, or containing any right of first
refusal with respect to, or granting any preemptive rights with respect to,
any Company Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the
voting of Company Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company or any

ARTICLE 4 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  

Except as set forth in (i) the Parent SEC Documents filed on or after January
1, 2017 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (other than any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements," and any other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature but, for the purpose of clarification, including and
giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any such
statements), but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be
applicable to _Section 4.2_ or (ii) the corresponding sections of the Parent
Disclosure Letter (it being acknowledged and agreed that disclosure in any
Section or Subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all other
sections or subsections of the Parent Disclosure Letter to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_ _; Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation, duly organized and validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except for such failures to be in good standing or to
have such power that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent's
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, in each case, except as would not reasonably

  

  

 

-30-  

  

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined
in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, a "
_Significant Parent Subsidiary_ ") and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Parent has made available or caused to be made available to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent Charter_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) the Amended and Restated By-
laws of Parent and any amendments thereto (the " _Parent Bylaws_ ") not filed
prior to the date hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents,
of each Significant Parent Subsidiary. Parent is in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions of the Parent Charter and the Parent Bylaws.

  

(c) Neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns
any Equity Interest in any Person other than the Parent Subsidiaries. All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each
Parent Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable and to the extent owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, are owned free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

  

4.2 _Capitalization_.

and outstanding, and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.00001 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as
of the Parent Capitalization Date, no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding. No Parent Subsidiary owns any Parent Shares or has any
option or warrant to purchase any Parent Shares or any other Equity Interest
in Parent. All of the outstanding Parent Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

  

(b) As of the close of business on the Parent Capitalization Date, Parent has
no Parent Shares subject to or reserved for issuance, except for (i) 3,359,488
Parent Shares subject to outstanding options to purchase Parent Shares ("
_Parent Options_ ") under the Parent Equity Plan, (ii) 1,738,149 Parent Shares
underlying Parent RSU Awards granted under the Parent Equity Plan (assuming
achievement of the applicable performance goals at the target performance
level) and (iii) 6,943,605 Parent Shares reserved for future issuance under
the Parent Equity Plan for awards not yet granted. As of the close of business
on the Parent Capitalization Date, Parent has no shares of Parent Preferred
Stock subject to or reserved for issuance. All Parent Shares subject to
issuance under the Parent Equity Plan, upon issuance prior to the Effective
Time on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which

  

  

 

-31-  

  

they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

  

(c) As of the close of business on the Parent Capitalization Date, other than
the Parent Options and outstanding Parent RSU Awards granted under the Parent
Equity Plan (collectively, the " _Parent Equity Awards_ "), there are no
outstanding Equity Interests or other options, warrants or other rights,
relating to or based on the value of any Equity Interests of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or obligating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue,
acquire or sell any Equity Interests of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Since
the close of business on the Parent Capitalization Date, Parent has not issued
any Parent Shares, Parent Options, Parent RSU Awards or other Equity Interests
(including shares of Parent Preferred Stock) other than Parent Shares issued
upon the exercise of any Parent Options or settlement of Parent RSU Awards, in
each case, that were either (x) outstanding as of the close of business on the
Parent Capitalization Date or (y) issued in compliance with Section 5.1(b), in
each case, in accordance with their terms.

  

(d) Other than the Parent Equity Awards, there are no obligations (whether
outstanding or authorized) of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary requiring
the redemption or repurchase of, or containing any right of first refusal with
respect to, or granting any preemptive rights with respect to, any Parent
Shares or other Equity Interests of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of Parent Shares
or other Equity Interests of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, other than any
such agreements solely between and among Parent and any Parent Subsidiary or
solely between and among two or more Parent Subsidiaries. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having
the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of Parent Shares may vote.

of all the parties thereto and is in full force and effect (except as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). As of the

time or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a

  

  

 

-42-  

  

condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter,
and Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the
Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing. Parent
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this
Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing

similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date
of this Agreement (including in replacement of a Lender)).

  

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations
under this Agreement.

warranty (and the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company's
Representatives, acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied, and disclaims
reliance, on any such representation or warranty) with respect to Parent, the
Parent Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with respect to any
other information provided, or made available, to the Company or the Company's
Representatives or affiliates or any other Person in connection with the

recognized reputation, that the failure to make a Company Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_ or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 7.1(f)_ , as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any (A) material changes relating to such Company Intervening
Event or (B) material revisions to such Superior Company Proposal offered in
writing by the party making any such Superior Company Proposal, as applicable,
shall constitute a new Company Intervening Event or Company Acquisition
Proposal, as applicable, and, in each case, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new written notice,
except that the Company Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days with
respect thereto, but no such new written notice shall shorten the original
Company Notice Period.

  

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or violate applicable Law or (iii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, in which the Company
indicates that it has not changed the Company Board Recommendation as of the
date of such statement, _provided_ , that such statement shall not constitute
a Company Change of Board Recommendation.

  

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, the
Company shall not grant any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any
standstill or similar agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may grant a waiver or
release under any standstill agreement, or any provision of any
confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver or release of any
standstill by the Company, including disclosure of the identities of the
parties

  

  

 

-53-  

  

thereto and a summary of the material circumstances relating thereto. Except
for the waiver or release of any standstill, or any provision of any
confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, as contemplated by
this _Section 5.3(h)_ , the Company shall not release or permit the release of
any Person from, or amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit
the amendment, waiver, termination or modification of, any provision of, any
confidentiality or similar agreement or provision to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or under which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any rights. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Company Subsidiary to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing to Parent the information specifically required to be provided to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.3_.

  

5.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.4_ , from and after the
date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article __7_ , Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent's Representatives (on behalf of Parent or
the Parent Subsidiaries) not to, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate
(including by providing any non-public information concerning Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to any Person or group for the purpose of facilitating any
inquiries, proposals or offers relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal) or
knowingly encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) withhold, withdraw or rescind (or change or qualify, in a
manner adverse to the Company), or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or
rescind (or change or qualify, in a manner adverse to the Company), the Parent
Board Recommendation, including the failure to include the Parent Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (iv) enter into any
merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement relating to any
Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_ ) or (v) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clause (iii) or clause
(v) (to the extent related to the foregoing clause (iii)), a " _Parent Change
of Board Recommendation_ "). Subject to the other provisions of this _Section
5.4_ , Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent's
Representatives (on behalf of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries) to, (A)
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution
of this Agreement) cease any discussion or negotiation with any Persons (other
than the Company and its affiliates and Representatives) conducted prior to
the date hereof by Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of the Parent's
Representatives with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (B) promptly
(and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution of this

or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (C) promptly (and in any event within seventy-two
(72) hours after the execution of this Agreement) request the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any Third Party within
the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in
connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that,

  

  

 

-54-  

  

for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any contact by Parent or any Parent
Representative with any Person is in furtherance of Parent's obligations
pursuant to this clause (C), such contact shall not violate the other
restrictions of this _Section 5.4_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.4(a)_ , Parent and the Parent's Representatives
may (x) contact any Person that has made after the date of this Agreement a
bona fide, unsolicited Parent Acquisition Proposal solely in order to seek to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof (which contact, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include any negotiation of such terms or conditions) and (y)
inform a Person that has made or is considering making a Parent Acquisition
Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_ ,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time that the Parent
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i) Parent receives a bona fide written
Parent Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, which Parent Acquisition
Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement and does
not result from a breach of the obligations set forth in _Section 5.4_ and
(ii) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
based on information then available, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or be expected to lead to a Superior Parent Proposal and the
failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
Parent may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with and
furnish information with respect to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
(including nonpublic information) to the Third Party making such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and potential sources of financing
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party
making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Parent Acquisition Proposal (subject to promptly and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof, notifying the Company of the status
and material details thereof (including copies of any written documentation
that is material to such Parent Acquisition Proposal)); _provided_ that Parent
(1) will not, and will cause the Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent
Representatives not to, disclose any nonpublic information to such Person
without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person and (2) will provide to the Company any nonpublic information
concerning Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries provided or made available to
such other Person that was not previously provided or made available to the
Company concurrently with the provision of such information to such other
Person.

  

(c) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify the Company in the event that Parent receives any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the Third Party making
such Parent Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal (or, where such Parent Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a
detailed summary of the material terms and conditions of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly
(and in any event at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to such provision or
engagement) advise the Company if Parent determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Parent
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_. Thereafter, Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a prompt (and, in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours) basis of the status and material details (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Parent

  

  

 

-55-  

  

Acquisition Proposal (including providing copies of any written documentation
material relating to such Parent Acquisition Proposal).

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_ ,
if Parent has received a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal that
(i) has not been withdrawn, (ii) did not result from a breach of the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.4_ and (iii) that the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes a Superior
Parent Proposal, the Parent Board may at any time prior to the time that the
Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, effect a Parent Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Parent Proposal.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_ ,
the Parent Board may, at any time prior to the time that the Parent
Stockholder Approval is obtained, and subject to compliance with the
requirements of _Section 5.4(f)_ , effect a Parent Change of Board
Recommendation if in response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to effect a Parent Change of Board Recommendation in response to
such Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

(f) Parent shall not be entitled to effect a Parent Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_ unless (x)
Parent shall have provided to the Company at least four (4) Business Days'
prior written notice (the " _Parent Notice Period_ ") of Parent's intention to
take such action, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions
of such Parent Acquisition Proposal (and have provided to the Company a copy
of the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect
of such Parent Acquisition Proposal) or a detailed written description of such
Parent Intervening Event, as applicable, and (y):

  

(i) during the Parent Notice Period, if requested by the Company, Parent shall
have engaged in good faith negotiations with the Company regarding any
adjustment or amendment to this Agreement or any other agreement proposed in
writing by the Company; and

  

(ii) the Parent Board shall have considered in good faith any proposed
adjustments or amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) and any other agreements that may be proposed in writing by the
Company no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of the
Parent Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to make a Parent Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_ , as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any (A) material changes relating to such Parent Intervening
Event or (B) material revisions to such Superior Parent Proposal offered in
writing by the party making any such Superior Parent Proposal, as applicable,
shall constitute a new Parent Intervening Event or Parent Acquisition
Proposal, as applicable, and, in each case, Parent shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to the Company and to again comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.4(f)_ with respect to such new written notice,
except that the

  

  

 

-56-  

  

Parent Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days with respect thereto,
but no such new written notice shall shorten the original Parent Notice
Period.

  

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit Parent or the
Parent Board from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Parent if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law or violate applicable Law or (iii) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, in which Parent indicates
that it has not changed the Parent Board Recommendation as of the date of such
statement, provided, that such statement shall not constitute a Parent Change
of Board Recommendation.

  

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 5.4(a)_ to the contrary, Parent
shall not grant any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any
standstill or similar agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent may grant a waiver or
release under any standstill agreement, or any provision of any
confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, if the Parent Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Parent
shall provide written notice to the Company of the waiver or release of any
standstill by Parent, including disclosure of the identities of the parties
thereto and a summary of the material circumstances relating thereto. Except
for the waiver or release of any standstill, or any provision of any
confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, as contemplated by
this _Section 5.4(a)_ , Parent shall not release or permit the release of any
Person from, or amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the
amendment, waiver, termination or modification of, any provision of, any
confidentiality or similar agreement or provision to which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is a party or under which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
has any rights. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Parent Subsidiary
to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement subsequent to the date
of this Agreement that prohibits Parent from providing to the Company the
information specifically required to be provided to the Company pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_.

  

5.5 _Efforts_.

  

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate

parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
take all such actions (if any) as may be required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (iii) obtain
(A) from any Governmental Entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent, Merger

-57-  

  

practicable, and in any event not later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Outside Date, and to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or any other Person, in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (B) from any Third Party any
consents or notices that are required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the case of this
clause (B), only to the extent that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
reasonably determine, after consultation and cooperation with one another,
that such consent or notice should be obtained or made, which determination
has been made for each item set forth on _Section 5.5(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, (iv) cause the satisfaction of all conditions within its
control set forth in _Article __6_ , (v) defend and seek to prevent the
initiation of all actions, lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other
Proceedings to which it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable Order, (vi) seek to have
lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order that may adversely
affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable Order, (vii)
prepare and file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and
other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings,
authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
Third Party or any Governmental Entity to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (viii) take all reasonable steps
as may be necessary to obtain all such consents and approvals, and (ix) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees
due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under any other applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall anything in this _Section 5.5(a)_ require, or be construed to
require, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, or permit the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates, to (A) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to
any action, if such efforts, action or consent, individually or in the
aggregate, would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (B) take any
actions, including the actions described in this _Section 5.5(a)_ , with
respect to Parent, its affiliates or their respective assets, categories of
assets, businesses, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or
arrangements in connection with obtaining approvals from any Governmental

operations in connection with obtaining approvals from any Governmental Entity

conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

  

No party to this Agreement shall consent to any delay of the Closing at the
behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, except as may be consented to
in advance in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or
more of its affiliates, acquire any Person or material assets thereof or
interest therein, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to cause a
delay beyond the Outside Date or prevent the consummation of the Merger on the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

 

-58-  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_ , each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the
other parties notified as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Proceeding, (iii) promptly notify the other
parties of any oral or written communication to or from any Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by

Subsidiaries, from or to any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent
and the Company may, as each reasonably and in good faith deems advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or
the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties with respect to and provide any
necessary information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request with respect to all notices, submissions, or filings made by such
party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such
party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance and consider in good
faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any applicable Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other Proceeding
other than the matters contemplated by _Section 5.14_ , in connection with or
related to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each
party hereto will consult with the other parties in advance and give the other
parties or their authorized representatives the opportunity to be present at
each meeting or teleconference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent shall, following consultation with the Company and
acting in good faith, direct and control all aspects of the parties' efforts
to gain regulatory clearance either before any Governmental Entity or in any
action brought to enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any
Competition Law.

5.6 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders Meetings_.

  

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but no later than forty-five (45) days) following the
date hereof, file the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4. The Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a part of
the Form S-4. The Company and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective stockholders as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Subject to _Sections_ _5.3(d)_ , _5.3(e)_ , _5.4(d)_ and
_5.4(e)_ and the other applicable terms of this Agreement, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and the
Parent Board Recommendation and also include (and the Company represents that
it will have obtained at the relevant time all necessary consents of the
Company's financial advisor to permit the Company to include in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus), in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together a
summary thereof. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts, and the Company
shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith with Parent, to have the Form S-4
declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the
Closing in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of Parent Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Shares, or
holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each of Parent or the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other parties with
copies of any written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments,
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from
the SEC. Parent and the Company shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith
and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other party or its
counsel, and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Subject to _Sections_ _5.3(g)_ and _5.4(g)_ , but notwithstanding any
other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 shall be made without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the parties consulting
and cooperating with one another, and considering in good faith the view of
one another in doing so ( _provided_ , that, without limiting the foregoing,
no amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be
made without the approval of both the Company and Parent, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or
any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company and such information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party hereto discovering such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and, to the extent required by law, rules or
regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable, in accordance with
applicable Law.

  

  

 

-60-  

  

(b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company will conduct a
broker search in anticipation of the Company Stockholders Meeting in
compliance with SEC Rule 14a-13, assuming the earliest record date practicable
and, from time to time, conduct additional broker searches as reasonably
requested by Parent. The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable following the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 by the
SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be determined by the Company
with prior consultation with Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
change the date of (or the record date for), postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall (i) be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions without the prior consent of
Parent and (ii) with respect to clause (B) below, postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions if reasonably requested
by Parent, in each case, (A) to the extent that, acting pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_ , the Company files an amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel that the failure to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in response to such filing would be
inconsistent with applicable Law, (B) if, on the date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is or would be present, or (C)
if Parent has postponed or adjourned the Parent Stockholders Meeting pursuant
to _Section 5.6(d)_ , until the date on which the Parent Stockholders Meeting
is held; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (A) or (B), the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned for more than
twenty (20) Business Days in total from the originally scheduled date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(c) The Company Board shall, except in the case of a Company Change of Board
Recommendation made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
stockholders to the effect as set forth in _Section 3.3_ , and, subject to
_Section 5.3_ , shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Company Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3_ , unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.
The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, during the last
seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
request its proxy solicitor to advise Parent at least one (1) time each
Business Day as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent
of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
and except as required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the
NYSE, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural
matters, including a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if
there are not a sufficient number of Company Shares present in person or by
proxy to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval) that the Company shall

  

  

 

-61-  

  

propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

  

(d) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent will conduct a
broker search in anticipation of the Parent Stockholders Meeting in compliance
with SEC Rule 14a-13, assuming the earliest record date practicable and, from
time to time, conduct additional broker searches as reasonably requested by
the Company. Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable
following the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 by the SEC for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. The record date for the
Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be determined by Parent with prior
consultation with the Company; _provided_ , that Parent shall not change the
date of (or the record date for), postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders
Meeting without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall (i) be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders
Meeting on one or more occasions without the prior consent of the Company and
(ii) with respect to clause (B) below, postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions if reasonably requested by the
Company, in each case, (A) to the extent that, acting pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_ , Parent files an amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4, and the Parent Board determines
in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the failure to
postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting in response to such filing
would be inconsistent with applicable Law, (B) if, on the date for which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled, Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Parent Shares to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is or would be present, or (C)
if the Company has postponed or adjourned the Company Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ , until the date on which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is held; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
clauses (A) or (B), the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or
adjourned for more than twenty (20) Business Days in total from the originally
scheduled date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

(e) The Parent Board shall, except in the case of a Parent Change of Board
Recommendation made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, recommend the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the Parent
stockholders to the effect as set forth in _Section 4.3_ , and, subject to
_Section 5.4_ , shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Parent Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4_ , unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to Parent's
stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation. Parent shall, upon the
reasonable request of the Company, during the last seven (7) Business Days
prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, request its proxy
solicitor to advise the Company at least one (1) time each Business Day as to
the aggregate tally of proxies received by Parent with respect to the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of the Company (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and except as
required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE, the
approval of the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter (other than
procedural matters) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

5.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not, and
shall cause their respective controlled affiliates not to, issue any press
release or make any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject, in which case, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and practicable under the circumstances, the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall consult in
good faith with the other party before making any such public announcement,
(b) with respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company
permitted by _Section __5.3_ or by Parent permitted by _Section_ _5.4_ , as
applicable (including to announce a Company Change of Board Recommendation or
a Parent Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ _5.3_ or
_Section_ _5.4_ , as applicable) or (c) statements consistent in all material
respects with any release, disclosure or other public statement previously
made in accordance with this _Section 5.7_. The press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and Parent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period
of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each Person who is employed by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who continues in
the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
affiliates on or after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) a base
salary or wage rate and short-term incentive cash compensation opportunities
that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation
and employee benefits, including, but not limited to, long-term cash incentive
opportunities and vacation and paid time off, but excluding equity or equity
based awards, change in control or retention bonuses and defined benefit or
nonqualified arrangements, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time,
in each case, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company Employee.

  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating
severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries (each, a " _New Plan_ "), each Company Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any

  

  

 

-63-  

  

waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such
New Plans is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his
or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable Old Plans, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plans ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

  

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
Person any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.8_ ,
no provision of this Agreement: (i) shall limit the ability of the Company or
any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance
with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or construed to amend,
establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement or (iii) create any third party beneficiary
rights or obligations in any person (including any current or former service
provider or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the Company
or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

  

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to indemnify, hold harmless and advance the costs, fees and
expenses of all past and present directors, officers and employees of the
Company or each Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ")
under and to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company or such Company Subsidiary pursuant to (i)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary,
and (ii) any indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement with any Covered Person and made available to Parent
(collectively, the

  

  

 

-64-  

  

" _Existing Indemnification Agreements_ "), in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, arising out of acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with
respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
5.9_ in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and any
Existing Indemnification Agreements, as applicable; _provided_ , that the
applicable Covered Person provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it
is ultimately determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 5.9_ or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation
hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

  

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the
equivalent governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification of
and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws and the equivalent governing documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable. Following the Effective Time, the Existing
Indemnification Agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation,
without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

  

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as favorable of coverage as is
available for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies shall be
approved by Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and provide such directors and officers with coverage
for an aggregate period of at least six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including in connection with the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, as

  

  

 

-65-  

  

applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

  

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is
adverse to the Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns);
it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including successors and
assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_. In the
event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this _Section
5.9_ , the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_
as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such Covered Person.

  

5.10 _Tax Treatment_.

  

(a) For United States federal income Tax purposes, (i) the parties intend that
the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and (ii) this Agreement is
intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a), to which Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are
parties under Section 368(b) of the Code. The parties shall not take any tax
reporting position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment for U.S.
federal, state and other relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
pursuant to a Final Determination.

  

(b) The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify, and will not take any action or cause any action to be
taken which action would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying, for the Intended Tax Treatment.

  

(c) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (1)
the Company Registration Statement Tax Opinion and (2) the Company Closing Tax
Opinion, including using reasonable best efforts to deliver to Latham and
Watkins LLP (or, if Latham and Watkins LLP is unable to deliver such opinions,
to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP) (i) the Company Registration
Statement Tax Certificates and the Parent Registration Statement Tax
Certificates prior to the filing of the Form S-4, and (ii) the Company Closing
Tax Certificate and the Parent Closing Tax Certificate, in each case dated and
executed as of the dates of such Tax opinions. Each of the parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts not to, and not permit any affiliate to, take or
cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or
cause not to be taken any action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any
of

  

  

 

-66-  

  

the representations made to counsel in the tax representation letters
described in this _Section 5.10(c)_.

  

5.11 _Alternative Structure_. If following the date of this Agreement all of
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or waived (except
that the Company Base Structure Closing Tax Certificate and the Parent Base
Structure Closing Tax Certificate cannot be delivered and the condition set
forth in _Section 6.3(e)_ has not been waived), but the Closing could occur if
the Company Alternative Structure Closing Tax Certificate and the Parent
Alternative Structure Closing Tax Certificate are executed and delivered if
the parties consummate the Second Merger (as hereinafter defined), Parent
shall, immediately following the Merger, cause the Surviving Corporation to
merge into and with a limited liability company that is wholly owned by Parent
and is disregarded as an entity for federal tax purposes (the " _New Surviving
Entity_ "), in accordance with the DGCL (such merger, the " _Second Merger_
"); _provided_ , however, that (i) the New Surviving Entity shall become a
party to, and shall become bound by, the terms of this Agreement, (ii) the
Company Alternative Structure Closing Tax Certificate and the Parent
Alternative Structure Closing Tax Certificate shall be executed and delivered,
and (iii) any action taken pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ shall not (unless
consented to in writing by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) (x)
alter or change the kind or amount of the Merger Consideration as provided for
in this Agreement or (y) otherwise cause any of the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article 6_ to not be capable of being satisfied. If the Second
Merger occurs, references to the "Merger" in this Agreement shall be deemed to
reference the Merger and Second Merger, taken together as one integrated
transaction.

  

5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Company Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium," "business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or
is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement,
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate and take all action
reasonably available to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing, subject
to applicable Law. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will take any
action that would cause this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to the requirements imposed by
any such Laws. No Company Change of Board Recommendation shall change the
approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any such Law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a "covered
person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Shares and
Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  

5.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties shall cooperate and consult with
one another in connection with any Proceeding (i) by the Company's
stockholders against the Company or any of its directors, officers or
affiliates with respect to this Agreement or the transactions

  

  

 

-67-  

  

contemplated hereby or (ii) by Parent's stockholders against Parent or any of
its directors, officers or affiliates with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall give notice to the other party of any such Proceeding as promptly as
practicable. Neither Parent nor the Company shall not compromise or settle any
Proceeding commenced against it or its directors, officers or affiliates
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) without the other party's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

5.15 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the
Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger and such other Parent Shares to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the
foregoing, including by providing information reasonably requested by Parent
in connection therewith. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting of
the Company and of the Company Shares from the NYSE as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

  

5.16 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be taken all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing,
if required, prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be
consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility
documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection
with the funding of the bridge portion of the Financing) with respect to the
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") not less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub with respect to conditionality than the terms and conditions
contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in
any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
seek the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letter
and the Definitive Agreements that are under its control and comply with its
obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Documents in a timely and diligent manner
to cause the Lenders to comply with their respective obligations thereunder,
including to fund the Financing, if required.

  

(i) Parent shall not, nor shall it permit Merger Sub to, without the prior
written consent of the Company: (A) permit any amendment or modification to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Agreements if

  

  

 

-68-  

  

such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of
the Financing, (2) reduces the amount of, or otherwise impairs the ability of
the Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the full amount of, the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (3) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Agreements relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or (4) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent may amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, if the addition of such
parties, individually or in the aggregate, does not add new (or adversely
modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing); or (B)
terminate the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement.

  

(ii) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (A) use reasonable best efforts
to obtain alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with available cash of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and the available portion of the Financing, to
fund the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts
(the " _Alternate Financing "_) from the same or other sources and which do
not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt
financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Financing
and (B) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that (1) any portion of the Financing or any financing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement structured as high yield
or debt securities financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, (2) all conditions contained in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than (x) any such conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing, and (y) those conditions the failure
of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), (3) the Marketing Period shall have ended and
(4) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or
alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.16_
) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter
(or replacements thereof), then each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing to be used immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the high
yield financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, in the event any
Alternate Financing is obtained and an alternate commitment letter (or similar
agreement) (the " _Alternate Commitment Letter_ ") is entered into in
compliance herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to "Financing" shall
mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant
to clause (B) below and any Definitive Agreements (including definitive
agreements relating to Alternate Financing), and (B) the term Commitment
Letter (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include any
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question and any
Alternate Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent shall provide
the Company with prompt notice of any material breach, material default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the

  

  

 

-69-  

  

Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice
or other written communication from any Lender or other Alternate Financing
source with respect to any material breach, material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement
of any provision thereof. Upon request of the Company, Parent shall appraise
the Company of developments relating to the Financing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and/or Merger Sub with this _Section
5.16_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide and use reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective officers, employees, consultants,
agents, advisors and other representatives, including legal and accounting
(the " _Financing Representatives_ "), to provide, all customary cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with Parent's financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Financing), including:

  

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation in marketing efforts
(including lender meetings and calls) and a reasonable number of drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions between senior
management of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and actual or
prospective lenders, investors and ratings agencies, in each case at
reasonable, mutually agreed times, and with reasonable advance notice, and
assisting Parent in obtaining ratings in connection with Parent's financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Financing);

  

(ii) assisting Parent and its financing sources (including the Financing
Sources) in the preparation of customary offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, lender presentations, prospectuses and
similar customary marketing documents, including, but not limited to, Debt
Offer Documents, for any of the Financing or any other financing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Offering Documents_ ");

  

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable in connection with the anticipated
timing for the marketing of the Financing or any financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement furnishing Parent and Parent's
financing sources (including the Financing Sources) and their respective
representatives with the Required Information;

  

(iv) as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) using reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company's independent auditors to furnish all required consents
and reports reasonably required for the Offering Documents (including consents
to be named therein), (B) upon the reasonable request of Parent, using
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's independent auditors to furnish
accountants' comfort letters (including customary "negative assurance" and
"tickmarks") with respect to the financial and related information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contained in the Offering Documents that are
customary in connection with high-yield financings of the type contemplated as
part of the Financing and (C)

  

  

 

-70-  

  

providing appropriate representations to the Company's independent auditors in
connection with auditor due diligence sessions and the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B);

  

(v) assisting Parent in connection with the preparation of pro forma financial
information and financial statements to the extent such pro forma financial
information or financial statements are required by SEC Regulatory
Requirements or necessary or reasonably required by Parent's financing sources
(including the Financing Sources) to be included in any Offering Documents;
_provided_ , that neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Financing Representatives shall be required to prepare any such pro forma
financial information or financial statements or responsible in any manner for
information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is
required for such pro forma financial information;

  

(vi) facilitating the execution and delivery as of (but not before) the
Closing of any definitive financing documents or other certificates, customary
legal opinions from applicable outside counsel to Parent and Merger Sub,
including local counsel, or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent; and

  

(vii) providing at least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent
requested at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date.

  

The foregoing or anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of the Financing
Representatives shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ or _Section 5.17_ that would: (i) require the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents
to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing or any other financing
of Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other matter or execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing
certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case, prior to the
Closing (other than customary representation letters referred to in clause
(iv) above), (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be
breached by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) require the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other

-71-  

  

financing of Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Financing Representatives in
connection with such cooperation pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ or any action
taken by them pursuant to _Section 5.17_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Financing Representatives
from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any other financing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any action taken by them
pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ or _Section 5.17_ and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ or _Section 5.17_ ), in each case,
except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Financing Representatives.

  

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries' logos and other trade marks in connection with the Financing or
any other financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a customary
manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this _Section 5.16_ represent the sole obligation
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates with
respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing
(including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or
Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

  

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information
provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Information is
(i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Information". For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may,
to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section 5.16_ at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof
and the Closing; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing
Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the markets. In
addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the
Commitment Letter or any financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file
a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains
material non-public information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines is necessary (after
consultation with the Company and if the Company does not reasonably object)
to include in

  

  

 

-72-  

  

customary offering materials for the Financing or any other financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case
other than offering materials to be shared only with "private side" investors
that are subject to a confidentiality agreement), then, upon the Company's
review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing, unless the Company
reasonably objects, the Company shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

  

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its affiliates pursuant to
this _Section 5.16_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the condition
set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ , as it applies to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations under this _Section 5.16_ , shall be deemed satisfied
notwithstanding any breach of such obligations by Parent or Merger Sub, as
long as at such time, Parent has deposited cash in an amount equal to at least
the Merger Amounts in a segregated account to be used solely for the purpose
of funding the Merger Amounts.

  

5.17 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

  

(a) _Prepayment of Indebtedness_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to use reasonable
best efforts, to deliver to Parent (i) at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date a draft payoff letter with respect to the Revolving Credit
Agreement (the " _Subject Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date a copy of a payoff letter (subject to the
delivery of funds and cash collateralization, backstopping or replacement of
letters of credit, in each case, as arranged by Parent) with respect to the
Subject Indebtedness in customary form (the " _Payoff Letter_ "), which Payoff
Letter shall (A) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage
costs and any other monetary obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) then due and
payable under the Subject Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and
the daily accrual thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (B) state that upon
receipt of the Payoff Amount under the Payoff Letter, the Subject Indebtedness
and all related loan documents shall be terminated (other than the terms
thereof that expressly survive such termination in accordance with the terms
of such documents) and (C) provide that all guarantees of any of the Company
Subsidiaries of the Subject Indebtedness and, to the extent secured, all Liens
securing obligations in respect of the Subject Indebtedness shall be released
and terminated upon payment of the Payoff Amount and the cash
collateralization, backstopping or replacement of any outstanding letters of
credit (which cash collateralization, backstopping, replacement shall be
arranged by Parent) on the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall repay the outstanding amount of the Subject Indebtedness by
wire transfer of immediately available funds arranged by Parent as provided
for in the Payoff Letter.

  

(b) _Senior Notes_.

  

(i) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the
terms of the 2023 Senior Notes Indenture, the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture and
the 2027 Senior Notes Indenture (collectively, the " _Indentures_ "), as
applicable, one or more offers to

  

  

 

-73-  

  

purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such term is defined in
the applicable Indenture) and any tender offer, or any exchange offer, and to
conduct a consent solicitation, if any (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), with respect to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes, the 2025
Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes (collectively, the " _Senior Notes_ ")
identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date
hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent; _provided_ , that any such Debt
Offer shall be (A) in compliance with applicable Law, the terms of the
Indentures and any other rights of any holder of the Senior Notes and the
terms of this _Section 5.17(b)_ , (B) at the sole expense of Parent, (C)
consummated using funds provided by Parent. Parent shall not be permitted to
commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided the
Company with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal and press release, if any, in
connection therewith and each other document relevant to such transaction that
will be distributed by Parent to holders of the applicable Senior Notes in the
applicable Debt Offer (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a period
of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
related Debt Offer Documents (in each case, at Parent's sole expense), which
comments shall be considered by Parent in good faith. Parent will reasonably
consult with the Company regarding the material terms and conditions of any
Debt Offer (other than financial terms), including the timing and commencement
of any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines. Parent shall
expressly condition the closing (or, if applicable, effectiveness) of any of
the Debt Offers on the occurrence of the Closing, and the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent, at Parent's request
and sole expense, to facilitate the initial settlement of the Debt Offers by
Parent on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the consummation of a Debt Offer
with respect to any series of Senior Notes shall not be a condition to
Closing. Parent shall conduct any Debt Offer in compliance with (and shall
cause the terms of any Debt Offer shall comply with) any applicable provisions
of the Indentures and with applicable Law, including the SEC Regulatory
Requirements, and the Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect
to any Debt Offer that is not in compliance with the applicable Senior Notes,
the applicable Indenture and SEC Regulatory Requirements. Subject to _Section
5.17(b)_ , at Parent's expense, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to, in each case, use their
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Offer; provided that prior to the Closing,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor counsel for the
Company shall be required to furnish any officer's certificates, legal
opinions or negative assurance letters in connection with the Debt Offers
(other than, in connection with the execution of a supplemental indenture
relating to any consent solicitation of the type described in clause (ii)
below, the Company delivering customary officer's certificates, and using
reasonable best efforts to cause counsel for the Company to deliver customary
legal opinions, respectively, to the trustee under the applicable Indentures,
to the extent such certificates and opinions would not (in the opinion of the
Company, its counsel and the applicable trustee) conflict with applicable
Laws, the applicable terms of the Senior Notes or the Indentures and would be
accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered) or
execute any other instruments or agreements in connection therewith other than
the supplemental indenture described in clause (ii) below. To the extent that
the provisions of SEC Regulatory Requirements conflict with this _Section
5.17(b)(i)_ , Parent and the Company shall comply with SEC Regulatory
Requirements and shall not be deemed to have breached their

  

  

 

-74-  

  

obligations under this Agreement by such compliance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or its
legal counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to the Financing or
any other financing of Parent or Merger Sub.

  

(ii) To the extent any Debt Offer includes a consent solicitation, then
subject to the receipt of the requisite consents, the Company and the
applicable Company Subsidiaries shall execute a supplemental indenture to each
applicable Indenture in accordance with the terms of each such Indenture,
amending the terms and provisions of each such Indenture as described in the
relevant Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent (and at
Parent's sole expense), which supplemental indenture shall become operative no
earlier than the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company or any of its officers, directors or other representatives
have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other
agreement that is not permitted under applicable Law, the terms of the
applicable Senior Notes or the applicable Indentures or would become operative
prior to the Effective Time.

  

(iii) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of or in addition to Parent
commencing or closing any Debt Offer for any series of Senior Notes, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by such
series of Senior Notes and the applicable Indenture, to (A) issue a notice of
redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such
series of Senior Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the
applicable Indenture, which notice of redemption shall either be issued
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time or be expressly
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and (B) take any other actions
prior to, at or after the Effective Time reasonably requested by Parent to
facilitate the redemption and satisfaction and discharge of such series of
Senior Notes pursuant to the redemption and the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the applicable Indenture and the other provisions of such
Indenture applicable thereto; provided, that prior to the Company being
required under clause (A) above to issue any notice of redemption to be issued
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or
shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the applicable
Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge. If a conditional notice of redemption is given, Parent shall ensure
that at the Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such
redemption are satisfied, the Company has all funds necessary in connection
with any such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of any series of Senior Notes pursuant to the
preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the "Discharge" of such
series of Senior Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, in each case, use their
reasonable best efforts, at Parent's sole expense, to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of any series
of Senior Notes identified to the Company by Parent in writing at any time.

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 5.17_ , neither
compliance by Parent and/or Merger Sub with this _Section 5.17_ nor any
failure to consummate any Debt Offer or Discharge prior to the Closing shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any delay in exercising any

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

  

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any such
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner that will achieve, to the maximum extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Company
Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the
Voting Agreement and

  

  

 

-102-  

  

the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
and supersede all prior agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement) and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement will be void ab initio.

  

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a)
from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Shares
to receive the Merger Consideration and any Fractional Share Consideration and
Dividend Consideration, and the right of the holders of Company Equity Awards
to receive the consideration therefor, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (b) any Persons entitled to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, exculpation or insurance benefits under the provisions of _Section
5.9_ following the Effective Time, with respect to such provisions and (c) as
provided in _Section 8.15_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto.

  

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including" and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Annexes" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Exhibits and Annexes to this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a part of
this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes. The words
"hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar
import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular Section or Article in which such words appear. All
references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of any item on the Company Disclosure
Letter by reference to any particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement
shall be deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any other Section or
Subsection of this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other
Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.
Except as otherwise indicated, "made available" or terms of similar import
mean (i) made available to Parent and its advisors in

  

  

 

-103-  

  

the electronic data room maintained by the Company for purposes of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) as publicly filed or
furnished by the Company with the SEC, in each case, at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the date hereof.

  

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

  

(a) Other than as set forth in _Section 8.15_ , this Agreement and all claims
and causes of action arising in connection herewith shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  

(b) Other than as set forth in _Section 8.15_ , each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising in connection herewith or any claim or cause of
action arising in connection with this Agreement or the negotiation hereof,
and any Proceeding for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by
any other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to or arising from this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation hereof in any court other
than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 8.12_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the Proceeding in such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_ and agrees that service made in
such manner shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH

  

  

 

-104-  

  

RESPECT TO THE FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION __8.12(c)_.

  

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto. Until and unless the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

  

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub were to breach any of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, (a)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
remedy breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in each case in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court shall
not have jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware
or any Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties
will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at law. Subject to _Section 7.3(h)_ , either party's pursuit of
specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party
may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by a party in the case of a breach of this
Agreement involving willful breach or fraud.

  

8.15 _Proceedings Involving Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of its controlled affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any
Proceeding, whether in law or in equity,

  

  

 

-105-  

  

whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources,
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing or any of the
agreements (including the Commitment Letter) entered into in connection with
the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such court, (b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of another state),
except as otherwise provided in the Commitment Letter or other applicable
definitive document relating to the Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or
support or permit any of its affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way arising out of
or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process
upon the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or its controlled affiliates in any
such Proceeding or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 8.3_ , (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally
and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law trial
by jury in any Proceeding brought against the Financing Sources in any way
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment
Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, (g) agrees that none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or Financing
Representatives (in each case, other than Parent under the Commitment Letter)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment
Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise and (h) agrees that the Financing Sources
are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, clause (d) of the
first sentence of _Section 8.10_ and this _Section 8.15_ , and that such
provisions and the definition of "Financing Sources" (and any defined term
used in any such provisions to the extent that any such amendment of such
definition would modify or amend the substance of any such provision in a way
adverse to the Financing Sources) shall not be amended in any way adverse to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Entities.

specifically provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall

Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or

Section 10. _Committees of Directors_. The Board of Directors may designate
one or more committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the
directors of the corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more

and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize
the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it;

ARTICLE V 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  

Section 1. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party
to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of the corporation, or, while serving as a director
or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the
basis of such Proceeding is an alleged action or inaction in an official
capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a
director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation
to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, as amended from time to time (" _DGCL_ ") (or other applicable
law), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the
corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection with such Proceeding;
provided, however, that, except as provided in clause (ii) of Section 2 of
this ARTICLE V with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification or advancement of expenses or with respect to any compulsory
counterclaim brought by such director or officer, the corporation shall
indemnify any such director or officer in connection with a Proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if such Proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The rights to
indemnification set forth in this ARTICLE V shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his
or her heirs, executors and administrators.

  

Section 2. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 1, such director or officer shall have
the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses (including attorney's
fees) incurred (i) in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition or (ii) in a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this ARTICLE V (the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided,
however, that, if the DGCL (or other applicable law) requires or in the case
of an advance made in a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses, the payment of such expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding shall be made only
upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be
determined ultimately that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified under
this ARTICLE V or otherwise.

  

Section 3. _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 1 or
Section 2 of this ARTICLE V is not paid in full by the corporation within (i)
ninety (90) days after a written

  

    

  

claim for indemnification has been received by the corporation, or (ii) thirty
(30) days after a written claim for an advancement of expenses has been
received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter (but not
before) bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the
claim, together with interest thereon, or to obtain advancement of expenses,
as applicable, and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, including
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith. It shall be a
defense to any such action brought to enforce a right to indemnification (but
not in an action brought to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses)
that the claimant has not yet met the standards of conduct which make it
permissible under the DGCL (or other applicable law) for the corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation
(or of its full Board of Directors, its directors who are not parties to the
Proceeding, a committee of such directors, its stockholders, or independent
legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
DGCL (or other applicable law), nor an actual determination by the corporation
(or of its full Board of Directors, its directors who are not parties to the
Proceeding, a committee of such directors, its stockholders, or independent
legal counsel) that such claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to such action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  

Section 4. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred by this ARTICLE V
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any director, officer,
representative, employee or other agent may have or hereafter acquire under
the DGCL or any other statute, or any provision contained in the corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any agreement, or pursuant to a
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. In furtherance
of the foregoing, the corporation acknowledges that a person may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by other potential or actual indemnitors. The corporation agrees that (i) it
is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its indemnification obligations to
such person are primary and any indemnification obligation of any other
potential or actual indemnitor to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification to such person are secondary to any such obligation of the
corporation), (ii) that it shall be liable for and required to advance the
full amounts set forth in this ARTICLE V without regard to any rights a person
may have against any other potential or actual indemnitor and (iii) it
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases each other potential or actual
indemnitor from any and all claims (x) against such indemnitor for
contribution, indemnification, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind
in respect thereof and (y) that a person must seek advancement or
reimbursement, or indemnification, from any other potential or actual
indemnitor before the corporation must perform its obligations hereunder. No
advancement or payment by any other indemnitor on behalf of a person with
respect to any proceeding for which such person has sought indemnification
from the corporation shall affect any of the foregoing.

  

Section 5. _Insurance and Trust Fund_. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the powers conferred by statute:

  

(1) the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or is serving at the request

  

    

  

of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity,
or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would
have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of
law; and

  

(2) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the corporation may create a trust
fund, grant a security interest and/or use other means (including, without
limitation, letters of credit, surety bonds and/or other similar
arrangements), as well as enter into contracts providing indemnification to
the fullest extent permitted by law and including as part thereof provisions
with respect to any or all of the foregoing, to ensure the payment of such
amount as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided therein,
or elsewhere.

  

Section 6. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification, including the right to advancement
of expenses, to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent
of the provisions of this ARTICLE V or otherwise with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
corporation.

  

Section 7. _Amendment_. Any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE V shall not
change the rights of an officer or director to indemnification with respect to
any action or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

  

ARTICLE VI 
  
 CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

  

Section 1. _Certificates_. At the option of the Board of Directors, the stock
of the corporation may be (i) uncertificated, evidenced by entries into the
corporation's stock ledger or other appropriate corporate books and records,
as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time, or (ii) evidenced
by a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the Chairman
or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or a Vice
President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or
an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation, certifying the number of shares
represented by the certificate owned by such stockholder in the corporation.

  

Section 2. _Signatures on Certificates_. Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent, or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with
the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at
the date of issue.

  

Section 3. _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When
authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of
Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed

  

    

  

certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the
same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond
in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

Section 4. _Transfers of Stock_. Upon surrender to the corporation, or the
transfer agent of the corporation, of a certificate for shares duly endorsed
or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to
transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate
to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the
transaction upon its books.

  

Section 5. _Fixed Record Date_. In order that the corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the
stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of

to the stockholder's mailing address (or by electronic transmission directed
to the stockholder's electronic mail address, as applicable) as it appears on
the records of the corporation. Notice shall be given (i) if mailed, when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, (ii) if delivered by
courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at the
stockholder's address, or (iii) if given by electronic mail, when directed to
such stockholder's electronic mail address (unless the stockholder has
notified the corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an
objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited
by the General Corporation Law to be given by electronic transmission). A
notice by electronic mail must include a prominent legend that the
communication is an important notice regarding the corporation. A notice by
electronic mail will include any files attached thereto and any information
hyperlinked to a website if such electronic mail includes the contact
information of an officer or agent of the corporation who is available to

constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the

lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or
members of a committee of directors need be specified in a waiver of notice.

EXERCISE OF WARRANT

   
---|--- 
   

2.1. _Manner of Exercise_. At any time or from time to time from and after the
Issue Date and until 5:00 P.M., Pacific Standard Time, on the Expiration Date,
Holder may exercise this Warrant, on any Business Day (the " _Exercise Date_
"), for all or any part of the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable
hereunder.

  

(a) In order to exercise this Warrant, in whole or in part, Holder shall
deliver to the Company at its principal office at 4900 N. Scottsdale Road,
Suite 2000, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251 (or any address subsequently indicated
in writing by the Company): (i) a written notice of Holder's election to
exercise this Warrant, which notice shall specify the number of shares of
Common Stock to be purchased; (ii) payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price in
accordance with Section 2.1(b); and (iii) this Warrant. Such notice (an "
_Exercise Notice_ ") shall be substantially in the form appearing at the end
of this Warrant as _Exhibit A_ , duly executed by Holder. Upon receipt of the
items specified in the preceding sentence, the Company shall execute or cause
to be executed, and deliver or cause to be delivered to Holder as soon as
practicable, a certificate or certificates representing the aggregate number
of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, together with cash
in lieu of any fraction of a share, as hereinafter provided. The stock
certificate or certificates so delivered shall be in such denomination or
denominations as Holder shall request in the notice and shall be registered in
the name of Holder. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised and
such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued, and
Holder shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for
all purposes, as of the date the notice, together with the Aggregate Exercise
and this Warrant, are received by the Company as described in this Section
2.1. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, appropriate notation
may be made on this Warrant and the same returned to Holder.

  

(b) Payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price shall be made, at the option of
the Holder as expressed in the Exercise Notice, by the following methods:

  

(i) by delivery to the Company of a certified or official bank check payable
to the order of the Company or by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the Company, in the amount of such
Aggregate Exercise Price (a " _Cash Settlement_ ");

  

(ii) by instructing the Company to withhold (and the Company so withholding) a
number of Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in
accordance with such Exercise Notice with an aggregate Fair Market Value as of
the Exercise Date equal to such Aggregate Exercise Price (a " _Cashless
Settlement_ "); or

  

(iii) by surrendering to the Company shares of Common Stock previously
acquired by the Holder with an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the Exercise
Date equal to such Aggregate Exercise Price (a " _Share Surrender Settlement_
").

  

In the event of any withholding of Warrant Shares or surrender of other equity
securities pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above where the number of shares
whose value is equal to the Aggregate Exercise Price is not a whole number,
the number of shares withheld by or surrendered to the Company shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole share and the Company shall make a cash
payment to the Holder (by delivery of a certified or official bank check or by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) based on the incremental
fraction of a share being so withheld by or surrendered to the Company in an
amount equal to the product of (x) such incremental fraction of a share being
so withheld or surrendered multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value per Warrant
Share as of the Exercise Date.

  

2.2. _Conditions to Exercise_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, if the sale of the Warrant Stock to be received upon exercise of
this Warrant has not been registered under the Securities Act, the issuance of
such Warrant Stock shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Company of a
written certification substantially in the

  

   

  

form of the certification attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , or, at Holder's
election, the delivery to the Company of an opinion of counsel, which opinion
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such Warrant Stock may
be issued without registration under the Securities Act.

  

2.3. _Payment of Taxes_. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and
without any preemptive rights. The Company shall pay all expenses in
connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges that may be
imposed with respect to, the issue or delivery thereof, other than income or
other taxes payable by Holder (whether such taxes are imposed on the Holder by
withholding or otherwise).

  

2.4. _Fractional Shares_. The Company shall not be required to issue a
fractional share of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant. As to any
fraction of a share that Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon
such exercise, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such
fraction in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction.

  

     

3.

  |  

TRANSFER, DIVISION AND COMBINATION

   
---|--- 
   

3.1. _Transfer_. Neither this Warrant nor any rights hereunder shall be
transferred, in whole or in part, unless such transfer is registered pursuant
to the Securities Act, or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Any transfer of this Warrant and of rights hereunder, in whole
or in part, shall be registered on the books of the Company to be maintained
for such purpose, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of
the Company referred to in _Section 2.1_, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant, duly executed by Holder, and funds sufficient to pay any
transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender
and, if required, such payment, the Company shall, subject to _Section 7_,
execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees and in the denomination specified in such instrument of assignment,
and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this
Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be canceled. A
Warrant, if properly assigned in compliance with _Section 7_, may be exercised
by a new Holder for the purchase of shares of Common Stock without having a
new Warrant issued.

  

3.2. _Division and Combination_. Subject to _Section 7_, this Warrant may be
divided into multiple Warrants or combined with other Warrants upon
presentation hereof at the aforesaid office or agency of the Company, together
with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new
Warrants are to be issued, signed by Holder. Subject to compliance with
_Section 3.1_ and with _Section 7_, as to any transfer which may be involved
in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new
Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or
combined in accordance with such notice.

  

     

4.

  |  

ADJUSTMENTS

   
---|--- 
   

The number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable and
the price at which such shares may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this _Section
4_. The Company shall give Holder notice of any event described below that
requires an adjustment pursuant to this _Section 4_ at the time of such event.

  

4.1. _Stock Dividends, Subdivisions and Combinations_. If at any time the
Company shall:

  

(a) take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of
entitling them to receive a dividend payable in, or to receive any other
distribution of, additional shares of Common Stock,

  

(b) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of
shares of Common Stock, or

  

(c) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares of Common Stock, then (i) the number of shares of Common Stock for
which this Warrant is exercisable immediately after the occurrence of any such
event shall be adjusted to equal the number of shares of Common Stock that a
record holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock for which this
Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the occurrence of such event would
own or be entitled to receive after the happening of such event; and (ii) the
Current Warrant Price per share shall be adjusted to equal (A) the Current
Warrant Price, multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which
this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the adjustment, divided by
(B) the number of shares for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately
after such adjustment.

  

4.2. _Reorganization, Reclassification, Merger, Consolidation or Disposition
of Assets_. In case the Company shall reorganize its capital, reclassify its
capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another Person (where the

  

   

  

Company is not the surviving corporation or where there is a change in, or
distribution with respect to, the Common Stock of the Company), or sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its property, assets
or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such
reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of
assets, shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation, or
any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature
whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in
addition to, or in lieu of, common stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation (" _Other Property_ "), are to be received by, or distributed to,
the holders of Common Stock of the Company, then Holder shall have the right
thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant and payment of the
Current Warrant Price, the number of shares of common stock of the successor
or acquiring Person or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and
Other Property receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable
immediately prior to such event. In case of any such reorganization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, the
successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the Company) shall expressly
assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each covenant and
condition of this Warrant to be performed and observed by the Company and all
the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as
may be deemed in good faith to be reasonably appropriate (as determined by
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company) in order to provide for
adjustments of shares of the Common Stock for which this Warrant is
exercisable which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the
adjustments provided for in this _Section 4_. For purposes of this _Section
4.2_, " _common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation_ " shall
include stock of such corporation of any class that is not preferred as to
dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and that
is not subject to redemption, and shall also include any evidences of
indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into,
or exchangeable for, any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of
a specified date or the happening of a specified event, and any warrants or
other rights to purchase or subscribe for any such stock. The foregoing
provisions of this _Section 4.2_ shall similarly apply to successive
reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of
assets.

  

4.3. _Intentionally Omitted_.

  

4.4. _Distributions_. Without duplication of any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 4.1_ or _4.2_ hereof, if, while this Warrant or any portion hereof
remains outstanding and unexpired, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall
have received, or, on or after the record date fixed for the determination of
eligible stockholders, shall have become entitled to receive, without payment
therefor, other or additional stock or other securities or property (including
cash) of the Company by way of dividend or distribution, then, in each case,
this Warrant shall represent the right to acquire upon exercise hereof, but
solely with respect to any portion of this Warrant that remains unexercised
and unexpired as of the record date of any such dividend or distribution, in
addition to the number of shares of Common Stock then receivable upon exercise
of this Warrant, and without payment of any additional consideration therefor,
the amount of such other or additional stock or other securities or property
(including cash) that Holder would have received had it been the holder of
record of the shares of Common Stock receivable as of such record date upon
exercise of this Warrant and all other dividends and distributions receivable
with respect to such additional stock or other securities or property after
such record date and prior to the date of such exercise of this Warrant,
giving effect to all adjustments called for during such period by the
provisions of this _Section 4_.

RIGHTS OF HOLDER

merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary
action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, but will at all times, and in good faith, assist in the
carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder against impairment.

which this Warrant is outstanding, acknowledge in writing, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Holder, the continuing validity of this Warrant and the

the exercise in full of this Warrant. All shares of Common Stock that shall be
so issuable, when issued upon exercise of any Warrant and payment is made
therefor in accordance with the terms of such Warrant, shall be duly and
