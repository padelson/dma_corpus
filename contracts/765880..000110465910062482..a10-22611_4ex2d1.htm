relevant to its review of the disagreement and otherwise to cooperate with the
other parties and the Auditor to facilitate a prompt resolution of the

the name of Seller or its designee(s), representing, in the aggregate, a
number of shares (such aggregate number, the " _Adjustment Share Number_ ") of
Parent Common Stock (in such denominations as shall be requested by Seller)
equal to (A) the Increase Amount _minus_ the Stock-Replacement Adjustment Cash
_divided by_ (B) the Deemed Parent Common Stock Price. If the Adjustment

Amount_ "), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release, from the Escrow Account to Parent Escrow Property (as defined
and allocated in the Escrow Agreement) in the amount of the Deficit Amount.
Each of Parent and the Company shall, no later than two (2) Business Days
after the Determination Date, execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the applicable Escrow Property
in accordance with this _Section 3.6.5 _and the Escrow Agreement. In no event

of the

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Property or (y) Parent have any liability under this _Section 3.6_ in
excess of an amount equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount. In no event
shall Parent be entitled to payment pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ other than
the release to it of all or a portion (as applicable) of the Escrow Property.
The Aggregate Purchase Consideration will be deemed to be decreased by the
Deficit Amount, to the extent the Escrow Property is sufficient recourse to
pay the Parent therefor; the Aggregate Purchase Consideration will be deemed
to be increased by the sum of (x) the cash amount and (y) the product of the
Deemed Parent Common Stock Price and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, in each case, delivered to Seller or its designee(s) in respect of the
Increase Amount.

 



 

 _Section 3.6.6_ _ _Prior to the Closing, the Company will receive an opinion
with respect to the valuation of OpCo from a nationally recognized firm that
is regularly engaged to render such opinions (the " _Valuation Opinion_ ").
The parties hereto agree that the fair market value of the Equity Interests in
OpCo, at the time of any actual or deemed distribution to the holders of
Equity Interests in the Company, for U.S. federal and applicable state income
Tax purposes, shall be equal to (i) if the Valuation Opinion provides a
specific fair market value of such Equity Interests, such fair market value
and (ii) if the Valuation Opinion provides a range of valuations, an amount
within such range specified by the Company in its reasonable discretion. The
parties agree that they shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates to,
take a position on any Tax Return or in the calculation of the Closing Date
Tax Amount pursuant to this _Section 3.6.6_ that is inconsistent with such
determination

this Agreement, (i) if, prior to Closing, Parent pays, or a record date occurs
for the payment of, a dividend in cash or (other than a stock dividend
accounted for in the Deemed Parent Common Stock Price) in kind on a pro rata
basis to all holders of Parent Common Stock (other than Parents regular
quarterly dividends, paid at the annual rate reflected in Parents most recent
market guidance, as the same may be increased or reduced by Parent from time
to time, which dividends are expressly excluded from this adjustment
provision), then the Cash Consideration will be increased to reflect an amount
(the " _Pre-Closing Excess Dividend Amount_ ") equal to the aggregate amount
that Seller would have received in respect of all such dividends on the shares
of Parent Common Stock included in the Stock Consideration if Seller had held
such shares on the record date for each such dividend, and (ii) if, prior to
the date on which payment of any Increase Amount is made, Parent pays, or a
record date occurs for the payment of, a dividend in cash or (other than a
stock dividend accounted for in the Deemed Parent Common Stock Price) in kind
on a pro rata basis to all holders of Parent Common Stock (other than Parents
regular quarterly dividends, paid at the annual rate reflected in Parents
most recent market guidance, as the same may be increased or reduced by Parent
from time to time, which dividends are expressly excluded from this adjustment
provision), then the cash amount payable in respect of the Increase Amount
pursuant to _Section 3.6.5_ will be increased to reflect an amount (the "
_Adjustment Excess Dividend Amount_ ") equal to the aggregate amount that
Seller would have received in respect of all such dividends on the shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Adjustment Shares Number if Seller had
held such shares on the record date for each such dividend. Any dividend
described in this _Section 3.7_ which is not paid in cash will be valued at
the fair market value of such in-kind dividend as of the payment date for such
dividend.

debt shall remain outstanding), (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Buyer and PropCo in connection with the
Purchase and Bridge Credit Agreement and (iii) satisfy all of the other
payment obligations of Parent, Buyer and PropCo contemplated hereunder.

without the Companys consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under the Bridge Credit Agreement if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Bridge
Financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Bridge Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (a) materially delay or prevent
the Closing, (b)

 



      
 

 



 

make the funding of the Bridge Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Bridge Financing) less likely to occur or (c) adversely impact
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Bridge Credit Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
6.10_, Parent may amend the Bridge Credit Agreement and any related fee letter
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities (and affiliates thereof) that have not executed the Bridge Credit
Agreement as of the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Bridge
Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof (and subject to Parents ability to undertake Capital Markets
Financings or sales of assets which reduce commitments under the Bridge Credit
Agreement), (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent in
the Bridge Credit Agreement and (iii) cause the Lenders and other persons
providing financing under the Bridge Financing to fund the Bridge Financing on
the Closing Date to the extent Parent deems it necessary to draw upon the
Bridge Financing on the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach or default) by any party to the Bridge Credit Agreement or
definitive document related to the Bridge Financing of which Parent or its
Affiliates becomes aware and (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any person with respect to any (x) actual or
potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
the Bridge Credit Agreement or any definitive document related to the Bridge
Financing or any provisions of the Bridge Credit Agreement or any definitive
document related to the Bridge Financing or (y) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Bridge Credit Agreement or
any definitive document related to the Bridge Financing (but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the
terms of the Bridge Financing or any definitive agreement with respect
thereto); _provided_ that in no event will Parent be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose
such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after
the date the Company delivers Parent a written request, Parent shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding
sentence. If any portion of the Bridge Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Bridge Credit Agreement and any
related fee letter, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent, than the terms set
forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement and any related fee letter, in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event and the provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall apply to such
Alternative Financing as though it was the Bridge Financing; _provided_ that
Parent shall not be required to arrange for such Alternative Financing or
execute any commitment letter or agreement in connection therewith (the " _New
Commitment_ ") on terms and conditions which are materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, to Parent than those included in the Bridge Credit Agreement
and any related fee letter that such New Commitment is replacing; _provided_ ,
further that Parent shall not be required to arrange for such Alternative
Financing or execute any New Commitment in the event that the proceeds from
any Capital Markets Financings are sufficient to

 



      
 

 



 

finance the Purchase on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, Parent, at Parents election, may
elect to cause HCP Mezzanine Lender, LLC and HCP Mezzanine Lender TRS, LLC,
which are the holders of the REIT Indebtedness comprised of the Fourth
Mezzanine Loan, Fifth Mezzanine Loan, Sixth Mezzanine Loan, and Seventh
Mezzanine Loan (each as defined in _Schedule 1.3_ and, collectively, the "
_HCP Mezzanine Loans_ "), to waive their rights to prepayment of the HCP
Mezzanine Loans and maintain the outstanding loan balances of the HCP
Mezzanine Loans as Indebtedness for Borrowed Money which shall survive Closing
and be a Permitted Encumbrance on the REIT Assets in all respects. In
connection with any such election, the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall,
at the sole expense of Parent, cooperate with Parents efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with such election, including by
cooperating with Parent and the servicer, lenders, and administrative agents
under any of the loans comprising the REIT Indebtedness to assist in
effectuating such election.

 



 

(b) If Parent does not cause all Indebtedness under the REIT Indebtedness to
be paid in full contemporaneously with the Closing, Parent shall take all
actions required for termination of the Bad Acts Guaranty, with no Liability
thereunder for the OpCo Entities.

 



 

 _Section 6.11_ _ __Cooperation with Financing_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, at Parents sole expense, cooperate as reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent (a) in causing the conditions in the
Bridge Credit Agreement to be satisfied, (b) in completing any Capital Markets
Financing on terms and conditions satisfactory to Parent and (c) as otherwise
necessary in connection with the Bridge Financing, any Capital Markets
Financing and the repayment and/or defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of
existing Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, including (i) using commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish Parent and its financing sources with financial
and other pertinent information regarding the REIT Entities reasonably
requested by Parent, (ii) participating in, and causing its senior executive
officers to participate in, a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies at reasonable times in connection with the Bridge Financing or any
Capital Markets Financing, (iii) assisting Parent in the preparation of
customary offering memoranda, bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations and lender presentations relating to the Bridge Financing or any
Capital Markets Financing and business projections and pro forma financial
statements reasonably necessary in connection with the Bridge Financing or any
Capital Markets Financing as reasonably requested by Parent, (iv) cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent for all or any portion of the Bridge
Financing or any Capital Markets Financing, (v) reasonably cooperating with
Parents legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such legal
counsel may be required to deliver in connection with the Bridge Financing or
any Capital Markets Financing, (vi) assisting Parent in obtaining surveys,
title insurance, non-invasive environmental assessments, zoning reports, or
any other real estate diligence as reasonably requested by Parent, (vii)
requesting, and using commercially reasonable efforts, at Parents sole cost
and expense, to obtain, estoppel certificates from landlords and other third
parties, including, without limitation, the landlords under the Ground Leases,
as reasonably requested by Parent, (viii) assisting Parent in connection with
Parents structuring efforts or otherwise assisting Parent in complying with
any reasonable structuring requests made of Parent in connection with the
Bridge Financing or any Capital

 



      
 

 



 

Markets Financing, (ix) requesting its independent accountants to provide
assistance and cooperation in the Bridge Financing or any Capital Markets
Financing including (A) participating in accounting due diligence, (B)
providing necessary consents for their audit reports, and (C) providing
customary "comfort letters" and (x) cooperating with Parents efforts in
connection with the repayment or defeasance of any Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money of PropCo and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , in each case,
that (a) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
incur any liability in connection with the Bridge Financing or the Capital
Markets Financing other than Liabilities of the REIT Entities arising after
the Closing, (b) the Board of Directors of the Company and the directors,
members, managers and general partners of the Companys Subsidiaries (except
for the post-Closing Boards of Directors and members of the REIT Entities)
shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents
and instruments pursuant to which the Bridge Financing is obtained, (c)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute
any definitive financing documents, including any credit or other agreements,
pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or
documents in connection with the Bridge Financing or the Capital Markets
Financing (other than the execution of such documents by the REIT Entities
following Closing), and (d) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment in connection with
the Bridge Financing or the Capital Markets Financing or any of the foregoing
other than fees payable by the REIT Entities following the Closing. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, its
Affiliates and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents and
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Bridge Financing
and the Capital Markets Financing (including without limitation any action
taken in accordance with _Section 6.10_ or this _Section 6.11_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing indemnity shall not apply with respect to any liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties resulting from a willful or intentional breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

 _Section 6.12_ _ __Section 16 Matters_. Parent shall take all steps
necessary to cause acquisitions of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement by each person who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or
will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent
(including any person deemed to be a director of Parent), to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 _Section 6.13_ _ __Delivery of Financial Statements_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered, on or prior to
February 1, 2011, to Parent, an audited consolidated balance sheet of PropCo
and its consolidated Subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and audited statements
of income and cash flows of PropCo and its consolidated Subsidiaries for 2010
(the " _PropCo Audited 2010 Financial Statements_ "). If the Closing has not

the other party of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of a Tax
Proceeding received with respect to Taxes for which OpCo or Buyer is liable
pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a partys failure to
give such notice will not affect the other partys rights to indemnification
under _Section 9.8_ except to the extent that the other party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies
of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.3.2_ _ _At OpCos request and expense, Buyer shall contest (or
cause to be contested) any asserted Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax liability for
which OpCo may have an indemnity obligation under _Section 9.8_. If OpCo so
elects, and acknowledges in writing its ability and obligation to indemnify
the Parent Indemnified Parties for the Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax in question,
OpCo shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing and at its
own expense, of any Tax Proceeding involving any asserted Pre-Closing Tax
Period Tax liability with respect to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes for which OpCo is exclusively liable
pursuant to _Section 9.8_; _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall
have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding, including through
counsel of their choosing, at their own expense. OpCo shall keep Buyer fully
informed on a timely basis of all matters relating to any Tax Proceeding
controlled by OpCo hereunder. OpCo shall not accept any proposed adjustment or
enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any Tax
Proceeding controlled by OpCo without the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, Buyer shall control the conduct of any Tax
Proceeding which may materially adversely affect any Parent Indemnified Party
(after taking into account OpCos indemnification obligations); _provided_ ,
that Buyer shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any
settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any Tax Proceeding controlled
by Buyer for which OpCo may have an indemnity obligation without the consent
of OpCo (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and, if the Tax
Proceeding relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, OpCo shall
have the right to participate in any such proceeding at its own expense. Buyer
shall keep OpCo fully informed on a timely basis of all matters relating to
any Tax Proceeding controlled by Buyer hereunder.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.3.3_ _ _In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a
Straddle Period, Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding, but
OpCo shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding at its own
expense if OpCo first acknowledges in writing its ability and obligation to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for the portion of the Tax in
question that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or
before the Closing Date; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not accept any proposed
adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding
any such Tax Proceeding OpCos prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Buyer shall keep OpCo fully informed on a
timely basis of all matters relating to any Tax Proceeding controlled by Buyer
hereunder.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.3.4_ _ _Payment by OpCo of any amount due under _Section 9.8_
shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by Buyer that
payment of such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity or other
applicable third party is due; _provided_ that OpCo shall not be required to
make any payment earlier than ten (10) days before it is due to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or applicable third party. Payment by Buyer of
any amount due under _Section 9.8_ shall be made within ten (10)

 



      
 

 



 

days following written notice by OpCo that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or other applicable third party is due;
_provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to make any payment earlier than
ten (10) days before it is due to the appropriate Governmental Entity or
applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 6.16.3_, payment of such contested Tax
will not be considered due earlier than the date a "final determination" to
such effect is made by such Governmental Entity. For this purpose, a " _final
determination_ " shall mean a settlement, compromise, or other agreement with
the relevant Governmental Entity, a deficiency notice with respect to which
the period for filing a petition with the Tax court or the relevant state,
local or foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal
has expired.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.4_ _ __Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall: (i) in the case of Taxes other than property Taxes, be deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the tax year or period ended on the
Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of property Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding tax period) _multiplied_ _by_ a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item (including the effect of any graduated rates
of Tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis
determined by _multiplying_ the total amount of such item allocated to such
period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the such period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Tax incurred in connection with the Reorganization
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax incurred in
connection with the Distribution of OpCo) shall be allocated to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.5_ _ __Refunds; Credits_. OpCo shall be entitled to, and Buyer
shall promptly pay OpCo, the amount of any Tax refund or credit (except to the
extent such refund or credit constitutes a Tax benefit that reduces under
_Section 9.4.3_ an amount to which an Indemnified Party would otherwise be
entitled) actually received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date to the extent such Tax refund or credit is attributable to Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-Closing Periods (net of any
reasonable costs to Parent or its Subsidiaries in obtaining such Tax refund or
credit). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain
any such refund or credit, including, subject to _Section 6.16.1.2_, through
the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. Buyer shall be entitled
to, and OpCo shall promptly pay to Buyer, the amount of any Tax refund or
credit actually received by OpCo or any OpCo Subsidiary with respect to Taxes
of PropCo and its Subsidiaries for any Tax period (or the portion of any
Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date (net of reasonable costs to
OpCo or any OpCo Subsidiary in obtaining such Tax refund or credit). OpCo
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such Tax refund or
credit.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any refund request filed on or prior to the
Closing Date shall not be treated as Cash and Cash Equivalents or otherwise
reduce Liabilities on any Balance Sheet until received.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.6_ _ __Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Company and
the Subsidiaries of the Company shall cause the termination prior to the
Closing Date of all Tax sharing and indemnity agreements or similar
arrangements among the Company and its Subsidiaries, and after the Closing
Date, none of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Buyer, or any
Affiliate of Buyer shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.7_ _ __Earnings and Profits Report_

 



 

 _Section 6.16.7.1_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer the formal report of a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm
(the " _Final E andP Report_") regarding the calculation of the aggregate
current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company and its
Subsidiaries through December 31, 2010. The Final EandP Report shall be
consistent in all material respects with such accounting firms earnings and
profits analysis provided to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement. Buyer
shall be permitted to provide the Final EandP Report to its auditors and in
response to a governmental inquiry.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.7.2_. At least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer an
analysis that rolls forward the calculation of earnings and profits from
December 31, 2010 through the Closing Date, using estimates where necessary.
The roll-forward analysis shall indicate the estimated aggregate current and
accumulated earnings and profits of the Company and its Subsidiaries
accumulated through the "non-REIT year" (within the meaning of Section
857(a)(2) of the Code) ending on the expected Closing Date.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.8_ _ __IRS Ruling; Alternative Structure_.

 



 

 _Section 6.16.8.1_ _ __IRS Ruling_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, a favorable ruling
from the IRS substantially to the effect that the transfer of the stock of
Manor Care, Inc. to NewCo 3 pursuant to and in accordance with Exhibit A to
the Reorganization Agreement will be a "qualified stock purchase" as defined
in Section 338(d)(3) of the Code, and is eligible for an election pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (the " _IRS Ruling_ "). The Company shall send

following the applicable Survival Expiration Date with respect to any claim
for indemnification as to which notice was provided in accordance with this
_Section 9.1_ prior to such applicable Survival Expiration Date hereunder.

extent arising from (A) any failure of any representation or warranty

claims are actually covered by any existing professional liability/general
liability policies; and the matters set forth in _Schedule 9.2.1_ ), of which
_Schedule 9.2.1_ is incorporated by reference directly into this Agreement to
the extent specified therein.

 



 

 _Section 9.2.2_ _ _Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article 9_,
from and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and defend the Company, its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")

Damages to the extent arising from (i)(A) any failure of any representation or
warranty by Parent or Buyer contained in _Article 5_ to be true and correct
on the date hereof or on the Closing Date, as if made on such date (except, in
the cases of any representations or warranties that address matters only as of
a particular date, as of such date), including those contained in the

Indebtedness, (B) arising on the Closing Date after the Closing and excluded
from the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Date Indebtedness in accordance
with _Section 3.6.2_ or (C) arising after the Closing Date.

 



 

 _Section 9.2.3_ _ _The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified
Party shall be entitled under this _Article 9_ shall be determined: (i) by
written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a
judgment or decree of any court of competent

 



   

     
 

 



 

jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor shall agree. Without limiting a partys obligation to make
payment upon the earliest event specified in the preceding sentence, from and
after the date on which the amount of Damages for which an Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification under this _Article 9_ is determined in
accordance with this _Section 9.2.3_ , interest will accrue on such amount
from such date until the date of payment at 10% per annum, compounding
monthly; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such interest will be payable in the
event that a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction
subsequently determines that the Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification for the underlying amount under this _Article 9_.

 



 

 _Section 9.2.4_ _ _For purposes of this _Article 9_ and for purposes of
determining whether a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2.1_ and whether a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2.2_ , any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered or made
available in connection herewith shall be determined without regard to any
qualification as to "Company Material Adverse Effect", "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" or "materiality" set forth in such representation or warranty
or in any document delivered or made available in connection herewith, and all
references to the terms "material", "materiality", "materially", "Company
Material Adverse Effect" "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or any similar terms
shall be ignored for purposes of determining whether such representation or
warranty was true and correct (other than with respect to _Section 4.5_ and
_Section 5.5_ ).

 



 

 _Section 9.3_ _ __Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 



 

 _Section 9.3.1_ _ _If any Action is commenced or threatened that may give
rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ ") by any person entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a
written notice (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Action,
(B) including a copy of all papers served, if any, with respect to such
Action, (C) to the extent known at such time, including the Indemnified
Partys estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action (it
being understood that in no event shall such estimate limit any claim for
Damages hereunder), and (D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure
to notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 9.3.1_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) the Indemnitor is actually and materially
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the
Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim
in accordance with this _Section 9.3.1_ prior to the applicable Survival
Expiration Date.

 



 

 _Section 9.3.2_ _ _Except as set forth in _Section 6.16.3_ , an Indemnitor
may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of any
Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel of the
Indemnitors choice (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party shall bear any fees, costs and
expenses of its counsel in connection with such Action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor will bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
one such separate

 



      
 

 



 

counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction (and shall pay such
fees, costs and expenses as incurred), if the defendants in, or targets of,
any such action or proceeding include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
there are or are reasonably likely to be legal defenses available to it which
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnitor or that
representation by the same counsel is or is reasonably likely to be a conflict
of interest. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor shall
control such defense. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, it shall be
permitted to settle or compromise any such Action, and each Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such defense by
the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims, counterclaim or
cross complaint against any Person in connection with the Action) and/or the
settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written approval, unless (i) the terms of such
settlement provide for a full and complete release by the third-party claimant
of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified
Party, (ii) the Indemnitor does not admit or otherwise acknowledge in writing
to the relevant court of Governmental Authority or third-party claimant any
liability, wrongdoing or misconduct on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates and (iii) such settlement is only for money damages that are
paid out of the Remaining Escrow Property or by OpCo and does not include any
equitable relief. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an
Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within thirty (30) days
after such notice is given, (i) give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject to such
Indemnification Claim and (ii) thereafter promptly assume such defense, then
the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such Action, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Action
or Actions subject to any such Indemnification Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The Indemnitor may participate in any defense or settlement
controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9.3.2_ and the
Indemnitor shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 



 

 _Section 9.3.3_ _ _If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any
circumstances that it reasonably expects would give rise to an Indemnification
Claim for any matter not involving an Action, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a
written notice (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
circumstances giving rise to the Indemnification Claim and (B) to the extent
known at such time, including the Indemnified Partys estimate of the amount
of Damages that may arise from such circumstances (it being understood that in
no event shall such estimate limit any claim for Damages hereunder). Failure
to notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 9.3.3_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced
by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified
Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this _Section 9.3.3_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.3.4_ _ _At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor or the
Indemnified Party, each such party shall grant the other party and its
representatives all reasonable access to the books, records, employees and
properties of such Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the
matters to which the applicable Indemnification Claim relates. All such access
shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under the
conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

 _Section 9.4_ _ __Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than the last sentence
of _Section 9.8.1_ and the last sentence of _Section 9.8.2_ ), any claims an
Indemnified Party makes under this _Article 9_ will be limited as follows:

 



 

 _Section 9.4.1_ _ __Indemnification Cap_. The aggregate amount of Damages for
which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2.1_ will not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
other than in connection with the indemnification obligations of OpCo
contained in _Section 9.2.1(ii)_ , which shall not be so limited. The
Remaining Escrow Property shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of
payment of any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2.1_ other
than (if there is insufficient Remaining Escrow Property to provide full
indemnification to the Parent Indemnified Parties for the Damages for which
they are entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2.1_ ) in connection
with the indemnification obligations of OpCo contained in _Section 9.2.1(ii)_
, which shall not be so limited.

 



 

 _Section 9.4.2_ _ __Claims Basket_. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ with respect to
any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(i)(A)_ unless and
until the amount of Damages (excluding costs and expenses of the Parent
Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with making such claim under this
Agreement) incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties that are the subject of
such claim (or any series of related claims arising out of similar
circumstances) exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per-Claim Basket_ "), and the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 9_ with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2.1(i)(A)_ to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages (excluding
costs and expenses of Parent Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with
making such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ (excluding amounts below any
applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds $20,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "),
and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Per-Claim Basket and
the Basket Amount. The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(i)(A)_ unless and until the amount
of Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties that are the subject of
such claim exceeds the Per-Claim Basket, and the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ with
respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2.2(i)(A)_ to
the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ (excluding amounts below any
applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds the Basket Amount, and the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount . For the
avoidance of doubt, any claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2.1(i)(B)_ , _Section 9.2.1(ii)_ or _Section 9.2.2(ii)_ or _Section 9.2.2_
(i)(B) shall not be subject to the Per-Claim Basket or the Basket Amount.

 



 

 _Section 9.4.3_ _ __Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other
Third-Party Recoveries_. All Damages for which any Indemnified Party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this Article 9 shall be reduced
by the amount of insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnification payments
and other third-party recoveries including any recoveries under the
Reorganization Agreement, actually received by any Indemnified Party (net of
any costs incurred in recovering such amounts) in respect of any Damages
incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party is
entitled to any insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, or third party indemnity
payments in respect of any Damages for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ , such Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize
such proceeds, benefits or payments. In the event that any such insurance
proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are
actually received by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such
Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the
claims to which such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or
other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of
such indemnification payment; _provided_ that any such refunds made by Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be made to the Holder Representative in its capacity
as such. Any Tax benefit calculations under this _Section 9.4.3_ shall be
determined using the highest combined marginal corporate Tax rate for federal
and applicable foreign, state and local Income Taxes for the applicable
period; _provided_ , that for purposes of the foregoing, an Indemnified Party
will be deemed to have actually received a Tax benefit to the extent that the
amount of Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party as shown on such Persons Tax
Return for the year in which the Damages are incurred or in an earlier year is
reduced below the amount of Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have been
required to pay in such year but for the deduction attributable to the
incurrence of the Damages.

 



 

 _Section 9.4.4_ _ __Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives
any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article 9_ , at the election of
the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of
its claims for recovery against third persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

 



 

 _Section 9.4.5_ _ __Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for any punitive, consequential, special
or indirect Damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue,
profits or income or loss of business reputation or opportunity related to the
breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 9.4.6_ _ __Damages Reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet_. No
Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Damages
in respect of any Liability reflected in the Closing Date Tax Amount or
Closing Date Indebtedness (in each case, as finally determined in accordance
with _Section 3.6.3_ ).

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.4.7_ _ __No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery due to the
facts (i) giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Purchase Consideration.

 



 

 _Section 9.5_ _ __Mitigation of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification before such Damages actually
are incurred by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

 _Section 9.6_ _ __Indemnification Escrow Amount_. Claims for Damages pursuant
to _Section 9.2.1_ shall be paid first from Remaining Escrow Property pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and thereafter (subject to the
applicable limitations in this _Article 9_ and, in the case of claims under
_Section 9.2.1(i)_ , only after the Escrow Expiration Date) from OpCo, as
applicable. All amounts paid with respect to indemnification claims under this
Agreement shall be treated by the parties hereto for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Consideration. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any claim required to be
made against the Remaining Escrow Property, OpCo (despite being the
Indemnitor) will not be responsible for any Damages in connection with such
claims, including with respect to expenses under _Section 9.3_ , except (i)
with respect to claims under _Section 9.2.1(i)_ , solely after the Escrow
Expiration Date, to the extent there is no Remaining Escrow Property and (ii)
with respect to claims under _Section 9.2.1(ii)_ or _Section 9.8_ , to the
extent there is no Remaining Escrow Property, but in each case, subject to the
terms and conditions of _Section 9.4_.

 



 

 _Section 9.7_ _ __Release of Indemnification Escrow_. The Escrow Agreement
shall specify that any Remaining Escrow Property shall be released to Seller
(or its designees in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) the Business Day
following the date (the " _Escrow Expiration Date_ ") that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim
pursuant to _Article 9_ shall have been properly asserted by any Parent
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the Escrow
Expiration Date and remains pending on the Escrow Expiration Date (any such
claim, a " _Pending Claim_ "), (i) an amount of Remaining Escrow Property
shall be released from the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement such that (A) the amount of cash remaining in the Escrow Account and
(B) the number of Escrow Shares then held by the Escrow Agent shall have a
combined value following such release (determined by, in the case of the
Escrow Shares, by multiplying the Average Parent Common Stock Price on such
date by the number of Escrow Shares remaining in the Escrow Account on such
date) equal to the amount of indemnification to which the Parent Indemnified
Party is entitled in respect of such Pending Claim and (ii) any Remaining
Escrow Property that remains in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date
in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to Seller (or its
designees in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) promptly upon resolution or
(if applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim. In each case in which this
_Section 9.7_ provides for the release of the Remaining Escrow Property, each
of Parent and the Company shall promptly submit joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Remaining
Escrow Property in accordance with this _Section 9.7_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.8_ _ __Tax Indemnification_.

 



 

 _Section 9.8.1_ _ __Tax Indemnification Obligation of OpCo_. Without
duplication of _Section 9.2_ , OpCo shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages from,
arising out of or relating to (i) any Taxes of the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, OpCo or any OpCo Subsidiary for (w) any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(x) that portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date
(calculated as set forth in _Section 6.16.4_ ), except, in the case of clauses
(w) and (x), to the extent such Taxes are attributable to any action taken by
or with respect to PropCo and its Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course
of business on the Closing Date after the Closing; _provided_ , that any
action taken by or with respect to PropCo or its Subsidiaries that is
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the last two sentences of _Section
6.10(a)_ ) or the Reorganization Agreement shall not be treated as being taken
outside of the ordinary course of business, (ii) any Transfer Taxes for which
the Company is liable under _Section 6.15_ , (iii) any failure by OpCo to
comply with or perform or not perform any covenant or agreement of OpCo
contained in _Section 6.16_ or the Reorganization Agreement and (iv) any
breach of the representations set forth in _Section 4.13.4_ , _Section 4.13.6_
or _Section 4.13.7_ , except, in the case of each clause (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv), to the extent included in the Closing Date Tax Amount. The indemnity
provided in the foregoing sentence shall include, without limitation, any Tax
liability arising by reason of any Parent Indemnified Party being liable for
any Taxes of another Person pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
or any analogous state, local or foreign Tax provision, by contract, as a
transferee or successor by operation of Law, or otherwise, and any Tax
liability incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 9.8.1_ indemnification shall survive until the expiration of the
latest applicable statute of limitations (except for the items in (iv) above
which shall survive for the period specified in _Section 9.1)_ and shall not
be subject to the limitations contained in _Section 9.4.1_ or _Section 9.4.2_.

 



 

 _Section 9.8.2_ _ __Tax Indemnification Obligation of Buyer_. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)
any Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries for (x) that portion of any Straddle
Period that begins after the Closing Date (calculated as set forth in _Section
6.16.4_ ) or (y) any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) any
Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable under _Section 6.15_ , (iii) any
Taxes attributable to any action taken by or with respect to PropCo and its
Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date
after the Closing; _provided_ , that any action taken by or with respect to
PropCo or its Subsidiaries that is contemplated by this Agreement or the
Reorganization Agreement shall not be treated as being taken outside of the
ordinary course of business, and (iv) any failure by Buyer to comply with or
perform or not perform any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in
_Section 6.16_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 9.8.2_ indemnification shall survive until the
expiration of the latest applicable statute of limitations and shall not be
subject to the limitations contained in _Section 9.4_.

 



 

 _Section 9.9_ _ __Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Following the
Closing, except for the remedies described in _Section 11.11_ ,
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or through any party
(including the Indemnified Parties) related to or arising from any breach of

 



      
 

 



 

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or otherwise
pursuant to, this Agreement (other than any breach of (i) any covenant or
agreement contained in _Article 3_ or (ii) any post-Closing obligation under
any covenant that provides for performance following the Closing Date).
Nothing herein shall limit any of the parties rights or remedies under the
Ancillary Agreements.

 _Section 11.2_ _ __Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.3_ _ __Severability_. The illegality or partial illegality of
any or all of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of this Agreement, or any provision hereof, and the
illegality or partial illegality of this Agreement shall not affect the
validity of this Agreement in any jurisdiction in which such determination of
illegality or partial illegality has not been made.

 



 

 _Section 11.4_ _ __Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, Parent and Company disclosure schedules and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto), each Ancillary Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and shall supersede all
previous negotiations, commitments, agreements and understandings (both oral
and written) with respect to such subject matter.

 



 

 _Section 11.5_ _ __Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, as applicable, and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. The parties may not assign
this Agreement, or any of their rights or liabilities hereunder (whether by
operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the consent of any
party, (i) a party may assign (including by way of a pledge) to its lenders or
other financing sources any or all of its rights hereunder (including its
rights to seek indemnification hereunder) as collateral security, and (ii)
each of Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to assign its rights, interests and
obligations

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder, in whole or in part, to one or more of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Company, but no such
assignment shall relieve either Parent or Buyer of its obligations hereunder.
Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Any such
assignment shall not relieve the party making the assignment from any
liability under this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.6_ _ __Third Party Beneficiaries_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any person other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) from and
after the Closing, Seller or its designee(s) or assignee(s) (in accordance
with _Section 11.5_) shall be intended third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, _Article 3_, (b) the Lenders shall be express third party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section 8.5.2_ and _Section 11.8_ and
(c) the JPMorgan Entities shall be third-party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, _Section 8.5.5_.

 



 

 _Section 11.7_ _ __Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event of an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.8_ _ __Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 



 

 _Section 11.8.1_ _ _Any and all claims or causes of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

 _Section 11.8.2_ _ _Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court
shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case
of claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and
agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding
brought pursuant to this _Section 11.8_, and each party agrees that service
of process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its
address specified in _Section 11.1_ is reasonably calculated to give actual
notice.

 



      
 

 



 

Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Lenders in any way relating to this Agreement, in any
forum other than the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in
the case of claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware); provided that this will not preclude any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in
other jurisdictions by Parent under the Bridge Credit Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.8.3_ _ _EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

 _Section 11.9_ _ __Interpretation_. The captions appearing in this Agreement
are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement or any of the provisions
hereof. In this Agreement (i) words denoting the singular include the plural
and vice versa, (ii)"it" or "its" or words denoting any gender include all
genders, (iii) the words "including", "includes" and "include" shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation," whether or not expressed,
(iv) any reference in this Agreement to a Section, Article, Exhibit or
Schedule refers to a Section or Article of or an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement, unless otherwise stated, (v) when calculating the period of time
within or following which any act is to be done or steps taken, the date which
is the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the
last day of such period is not a Business Day, then the period shall end on
the next day which is a Business Day, (vi) the words "shall" and "will" have
the same meaning, (vii)"hereof", "herein", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement, (viii) any Law defined or
referred to herein means such Law or statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
Laws, (ix) the term "dollars" and "$" means United States dollars, and (x) the
term "or" has, except where otherwise indicated, the inclusive meaning
represented by the phrase "and/or". The definitions given for terms in
_Article 1_ and elsewhere in this Agreement shall apply equally to both the
singular and plural forms of the terms defined. References to any agreement or
contract are to that agreement or contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof. References to any person include the successors and permitted assigns
of that person. Any disclosure made by a party in the Schedules with reference
to any section or schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
disclosure with respect to all other sections or schedules to which such
disclosure may apply to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to
such other sections or schedules is readily apparent on its face. Certain
information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for informational
purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.
The disclosure of any information shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment that such

 



      
 

 



 

information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations
and warranties made in this Agreement, nor shall such information be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality. All accounting terms used herein and not
expressly defined herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP.
Solely for purposes of _Article 4_ and the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect, all references to Subsidiaries of the Company include PropCo
and its Subsidiaries and OpCo Entities then in existence on the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, whether or not the Reorganization Transactions
have occurred.

 



 

 _Section 11.10_ _ __Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other parties, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 11.11_ _ __Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and
covenants hereunder shall cause irreparable injury to the other party for
which damages, even if available, shall not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder. In the event that any action shall
be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party
shall allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law, and each party waives any requirement of the other
party to post a bond or other security in connection with seeking specific
performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
circumstances where the Parent and Buyer are obligated to consummate the
Purchase and the Purchase has not been consummated on or prior to the last day
that the Closing was scheduled to occur under _Section 2.1_, the parties
acknowledge that the Company, PropCo and OpCo shall not be entitled to enforce
specifically the obligations of Parent or Buyer to consummate the Purchase
under circumstances where the Company could terminate pursuant to _Section
8.1.6_.

 



 

 _Section 11.12_ _ __REIT Savings Clause_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any amount paid to any Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement in any tax year exceed the
maximum amount that can be paid in such year without causing any Parent
Indemnified Party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") for such year, determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(I) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") as
determined by independent accountants to Parent. If the amount payable for any
tax year under the preceding sentence is less than the amount which the
Indemnitor would otherwise be obligated to pay to the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Indemnifiable Amount_ "), the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall so notify the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor
shall (at the Parent Indemnified Parties sole cost and expense) place the
remaining portion of the Indemnifiable Amount in escrow and shall

 



      
 

 



 

not execute any instrumentation permitting a release of any portion thereof to
the Parent Indemnified Parties, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to any such amount, unless and until the Indemnitor and escrow
holder receive (all at the Parent Indemnified Parties sole cost and expense)
notice from Parent, together with either (a) an opinion of Parents tax
counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not
constitute gross income which is not Qualifying Income or (b) a letter from
Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to the Parent Indemnified Parties without causing any Parent
Indemnified Party to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant
taxable year, together with either a ruling from the IRS issued to Parent or
an opinion of Parents tax counsel to the effect that such payment would not
be treated as includible in the income of the applicable Parent Indemnified
Party for any prior taxable year, in which event the escrow holder shall pay
such maximum amount. The Indemnitors and escrow holders obligation to pay
any unpaid portion of the Indemnifiable Amount shall terminate ten (10) years
from the date of this Agreement and, upon such date, escrow holder shall remit
any remaining funds in escrow to the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall have
no obligation to make any further payments to the Parent Indemnified Parties
notwithstanding that the entire Indemnifiable Amount has not been paid as of
such date.
