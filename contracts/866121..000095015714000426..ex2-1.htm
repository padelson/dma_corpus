SECTION 1.04. Consents. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents to the contrary, neither this Agreement nor any
other Transaction Document shall constitute an agreement to contribute, assign
or transfer any asset, property, claim or right, in each case the
contribution, assignment or transfer of which is otherwise contemplated
hereby, if such a contribution, assignment or transfer or attempt to make such
a contribution, assignment or transfer without the consent or approval of a
third party would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of
such third party (such assets being collectively referred to herein as
"Restricted Assets"), and any contribution, transfer or assignment of any
interest under any such Restricted Asset shall be made subject to such consent
or approval being obtained. In the event any such consent or approval is not
obtained prior to the Sporting Transfer Time, (i) ATK, on the one hand, and
Sporting, on the other, shall cooperate with one another in attempting to
obtain any such consent or approval following the Sporting Transfer Time, (ii)
to the extent practicable, ATK, on the one hand, and Sporting, on the other,
shall cooperate with one another in structuring and documenting any lawful and
reasonable alternative arrangements (such as a license, sublease or operating
agreement) until such time as such consent or approval has been obtained, that
results in ATK (or an ATK Subsidiary) or Sporting (or a Sporting Subsidiary),
as applicable, receiving all the benefits and bearing all the costs,
Liabilities and burdens with respect to any such Restricted Asset and (iii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, unless and until any such consent or approval with
respect to any Restricted Asset is obtained, such Restricted Asset shall not
constitute a Sporting Asset and any associated Liability shall not constitute
a Sporting Liability for any purpose under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, and the failure of any such consent or approval to be
obtained or the failure of any such Restricted Asset to constitute a Sporting
Asset or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a breach by ATK or Sporting of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or a failure of any condition under this
Agreement. On the Closing Date, ATK shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to
Orbital (for information purposes only) a schedule setting forth all material
Restricted Assets existing as of the Closing Date. To the extent there are any
third party Contracts in effect as of the Closing Date with benefits and/or
obligations accruing to both the ATK Business and the Sporting Business (other
than Contracts primarily related to corporate level services that ATK will be
providing to Sporting under the Transition Services Agreement), ATK and
Sporting agree, to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, to
cooperate in good faith from and after the Closing Date to seek to divide or
otherwise amend any such applicable Contract in a manner that would allow the
party that is not party to such shared Contract to continue to obtain the
benefits of and have the obligations under such Contract (including by working
with the applicable third party or third parties to such Contracts to
accomplish the foregoing), it being understood that the foregoing obligations
shall not require any party to incur any Liability other than the Liabilities
it currently has under the shared Contract (or its reasonable allocation of
Liabilities) or incur any expense in connection therewith that it would not be
required to incur under such shared Contract or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

to take any other action if such action would reasonably be expected to harm
or prejudice such party in any material respect.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. Misallocated Transfers. In the event that, at any time or from
time to time after the Sporting Transfer Time, any party hereto (or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall receive or otherwise possess any asset, property, claim or
right or be liable for any Liability that is allocated to any other party (or
any of its Subsidiaries) pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, such party shall promptly transfer or assign, or cause to be
transferred or assigned, such asset, property, claim, right or Liability to
the party (or its applicable Subsidiary) so entitled thereto, and the relevant
party will cause such entitled party (or its applicable Subsidiary) to accept
such asset, property, claim or right or assume such Liability. Prior to any
such transfer, the parties shall comply, to the extent applicable, with
Section 1.04.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.06. Termination of Intercompany Contracts. (a) Except as set forth
in Section 1.06(b), in furtherance of the releases and other provisions of
Section 11.01, Sporting and each Sporting Subsidiary, on the one hand, and ATK
and each ATK Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall, on or prior to the
Distribution Date, terminate any and all Contracts between or among Sporting
or any Sporting Subsidiary, on the one hand, and ATK or any ATK Subsidiary, on
the other hand (including the Intercompany Contracts). No such terminated
Contract (including any provision thereof which purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Distribution
Date, and all parties shall be released from all Liabilities thereunder. Each
of the parties hereto shall, at the reasonable request of any other party
hereto, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to
effect the foregoing.

  

  

(b) The provisions of Section 1.06(a) shall not apply to any of the following
Contracts (or to any of the provisions thereof): (i) this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents (and each other agreement or instrument expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be entered
into by any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries),
(ii) any Contract listed or described in Section 1.06(b) of the ATK Disclosure
Letter, (iii) any Contract to which any Person other than ATK and Sporting and
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries is a party and (iv) any other
Contract that this Agreement or any other Transaction Document expressly
contemplates will survive the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.07. Sporting Transfer Documents. In furtherance of the contribution,
assignment and transfer of assets, properties, claims, rights and Liabilities,
in each case as specified in this Article I, at or prior to the Sporting
Transfer Time and, with respect to Restricted Assets, at such time after the
Sporting Transfer Time as such Restricted Asset can be assigned or
transferred, (a) ATK shall, and shall cause the applicable ATK Subsidiaries
to, execute and deliver such bills of sale, deeds, assignments and
assumptions, leases, subleases, stock powers, certificates of title and other
instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer (including supplemental
transfer Tax forms, if applicable) as and to the extent necessary to evidence
the contribution, assignment or transfer of ATK's or the applicable ATK
Subsidiary's right, title and interest in and to the Sporting Assets to
Sporting, (b) Sporting shall, and shall cause the

deeds, assignments and assumptions, leases, subleases, stock powers,
certificates of title and other instruments of conveyance, assignment and
transfer (including supplemental transfer Tax forms, if applicable) as and to
the extent necessary to evidence the conveyance, assignment or transfer of the
applicable Sporting Subsidiary's right, title and interest in and to the
assets, properties, claims and rights set forth in Section 1.01(a) of the ATK
Disclosure Letter to ATK, (c) Sporting shall execute and deliver such
assignments of contracts and other instruments of assumption as and to the
extent necessary to evidence the valid and effective assumption by Sporting of
the Sporting Liabilities and (d) ATK shall execute and deliver such
assignments of contracts and other instruments of assumption as and to the
extent necessary to evidence the valid and effective assumption by ATK of the
Liabilities set forth in Section 1.01(a) of the ATK Disclosure Letter (the
documents contemplated by clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d), collectively, the
"Sporting Transfer Documents"). ATK and Sporting shall provide Orbital a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all instruments to be executed
and delivered pursuant to this Section 1.07 prior to the execution thereof.
Unless otherwise agreed to between the parties hereto, the Sporting Transfer
Documents shall not provide for any additional representations and warranties
other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. To the extent of any
conflict between the provisions of the Sporting Transfer Documents and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall control.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.08. Disclaimer. All of the Sporting Assets and the Sporting
Liabilities, as well as all of the assets, properties, claims, rights and
Liabilities set forth in Section 1.01(a) of the ATK Disclosure Letter, will be

implied warranties as to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or

recognize that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.23 of
this Agreement, during the Transition Period, the parties hereto may determine
it to be in their mutual best interests to transfer an individual classified
as an ATK Shared Services Employee to Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary
(such agreed upon transfer of employment, a "Transition Period Employment
Transfer"). With the express written consent of ATK's and Sporting's head of
human resources (or such individual's delegate), such ATK Shared Services
Employee's employment will be terminated by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary, and
such individual will be immediately offered employment by Sporting or any
Sporting Subsidiary (such terminations and offers of employment are referred

result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  

  

SECTION 1.11. Treatment of Post-Closing Payments. For all Tax purposes, the
parties hereto shall treat all payments made after the Closing (i) by Sporting
or any Sporting Subsidiary to ATK or any ATK Subsidiary as a distribution,
immediately before the Distribution, from Sporting to ATK that reduces ATK's

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

The Distribution

the Distribution Date and any appropriate procedures in connection with the
Distribution, and all Sporting Common Stock held by ATK on the Distribution
Date shall be distributed as provided in Section 2.02.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. The Distribution. (a) ATK shall appoint the transfer agent for
the ATK Common Stock (or an Affiliate of such transfer agent) or another bank
or trust company reasonably approved by Orbital to act as agent in connection
with the Distribution as provided in this Section 2.02 and as agent for the
issuance of ATK Common Stock in the Merger as contemplated by Article IV (the
"Agent").

  


 

  

(b) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
(i) on or prior to the Distribution Date, ATK shall irrevocably deliver to the
Agent, for the benefit of the Eligible Holders, certificates representing (or
authorize the related book-entry transfer, for the benefit of the Eligible
Holders, of) all the Sporting Common Stock outstanding as of the Distribution
Date and (ii) on the Distribution Date, ATK shall instruct the Agent to (A)
distribute to each Eligible Holder (or such Eligible Holder's bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee on such Eligible Holder's behalf) electronically, by
direct registration in book-entry form, the number of whole shares of Sporting
Common Stock (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that Eligible
Holders of ATK Restricted Shares shall only receive Sporting Restricted Shares
as provided under Section 8.27(a)(ii)) to which such Eligible Holder is
entitled based upon the total number of shares of Sporting Common Stock held
by ATK on the Distribution Date divided by the sum of (X) the total number of
shares of ATK Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date and (Y) the total
number of ATK Benefit Plan Shares, if any, that are issued by ATK after the
Record Date and prior to the Distribution Date (the "Distribution Ratio") and

Eligible Holder is entitled based upon the Distribution Ratio.

  


 

  

(c) The Agent and ATK shall, as soon as practicable after the Distribution
Date, (i) determine the number of whole shares and fractional shares of
Sporting Common Stock that each Eligible Holder is entitled to receive in the
Distribution, (ii) aggregate all such fractional shares of all Eligible
Holders into whole shares and sell the whole shares obtained thereby in open
market transactions at then-prevailing trading prices on behalf of Eligible
Holders to whom fractional share interests otherwise would have been
distributed in the Distribution and (iii) distribute to each such Eligible
Holder, or for the benefit of each beneficial owner who otherwise would have
been entitled to receive fractional shares, such Eligible Holder's or
beneficial owner's ratable share of the net proceeds of such sales, based upon
the average gross selling price per share of Sporting Common Stock after
making appropriate deductions for any amount required to be withheld under
applicable Tax Law as contemplated by Section 4.04 and less any brokers'
charges, commissions or transfer Taxes. The Agent, in its sole discretion,
will determine the timing and method of selling such shares, the selling price
of such shares and the broker-dealer to which such shares will be sold;
provided, however, that the designated broker-dealer is not an Affiliate of
ATK, Orbital or Sporting. No interest will accrue on the proceeds from the
sale of such shares.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. Timing of the Distribution. (a) Subject to Sections 2.03(b),
2.03(c) and 2.03(d) and to ATK's ability to legally declare and pay the
dividend represented by the Distribution at such time under the DGCL, ATK
shall consummate the Sporting Transfers and the Distribution as promptly as
reasonably practicable after satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law,
waiver by the parties entitled to the benefit thereof) of all the conditions
set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied as of the Closing Date and shall in fact be
satisfied at such time). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and
agreed that the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 9.04 shall
not be a condition to ATK's obligation to consummate the Sporting Transfers
and the Distribution.

  


 

  

(b) ATK may, in its sole discretion, consummate the Sporting Transfers prior
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. 
 

  

(c) At any time following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waiver by the parties entitled to the benefit thereof) of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.01 (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied as of the Closing Date), ATK shall have the right to deliver to
Orbital a written notice executed by ATK, Sporting and Merger Sub (the "ATK
Closing Confirmation") pursuant to which, subject to the following sentence,
each of ATK, Sporting and Merger Sub (to the extent such conditions,
obligations and waivers are applicable to such party) (i) confirms that each
of the conditions to its obligations to effect the Sporting Transfers, the
Distribution and the Merger set forth in Section 9.01 (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied as of the Closing Date) has been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by ATK, Sporting and
Merger Sub), (ii) confirms that, to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

knowledge of ATK, as of the date of the ATK Closing Confirmation, the
conditions to its obligations to effect the Sporting Transfers, the
Distribution and the Merger set forth in Section 9.02(a)(i) would be satisfied
if the Closing Date occurred on such date, (iii) irrevocably waives each of
the conditions to its obligations to effect the Sporting Transfers, the
Distribution and the Merger set forth in Sections 9.02(a)(ii), 9.02(b) (other
than such obligations that by their nature are to be performed after the
Distribution Date), 9.02(d) and 9.02(e), (iv) delivers executed copies of the
certificates contemplated by Section 9.03(c) to be held in escrow pending
receipt of the Orbital Closing Confirmation and (v) requests that Orbital (A)
confirm that each of the conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger
set forth in Section 9.01 (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied as of the Closing Date) has been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by Orbital), (B) confirm that, to the knowledge of
Orbital, as of the date of the Orbital Closing Confirmation, the conditions to
its obligations to effect the Merger set forth in Section 9.03(a)(i) would be
satisfied if the Closing Date occurred on such date, (C) irrevocably waive
each of the conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger set forth in
Sections 9.03(a)(ii), 9.03(b) (other than such obligations that by their
nature are to be performed after the Distribution Date), 9.03(d) and 9.03(e)
and (D) deliver an executed copy of the certificate contemplated by Section
9.02(c). The confirmations and waivers of ATK, Sporting and Merger Sub
contained in the ATK Closing Confirmation shall become effective, and executed
copies of the certificates contemplated by Section 9.03(c) shall be released
from escrow, only upon Orbital's delivery to ATK of a written notice executed
by Orbital (the "Orbital Closing Confirmation") containing the confirmations,
waivers and executed certificate from Orbital requested in the ATK Closing
Confirmation. ATK shall be entitled to delay the consummation of the Sporting
Transfers and the Distribution until such time as Orbital has delivered the
Orbital Closing Confirmation to ATK. If Orbital delivers an Orbital Closing
Confirmation, then subject to Section 2.03(d), ATK shall consummate the
Sporting Transfers and the Distribution as promptly as reasonably practicable
after its receipt of the Orbital Closing Confirmation, but, subject to ATK's
rights under Section 2.03(d), in no event later than five Business Days of
receipt of such confirmation.

  


 

  

(d) ATK shall be entitled to delay the Distribution Date until the later to
occur (i) 10 days after the date on which the Distribution would otherwise
occur pursuant to Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(c) to the extent necessary to
comply with any NYSE rules relating to notices of record dates and dividends
and (ii) the date on which the proceeds of the New Sporting Debt Financing are
available in full as contemplated by the proviso set forth in Section 3.02;
provided that if ATK delays the Distribution Date pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) of this Section 2.03(d) by more than 10 days, then any ATK Closing
Confirmation or Orbital Closing Confirmation given prior to the date thereof
shall become null and void (it being understood that ATK shall have the right
to follow the procedures set forth in Section 2.03(c) and issue a new ATK
Closing Confirmation at a later date).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. The Sporting Dividend. Prior to or immediately following the
consummation of the Distribution, Sporting shall incur the New Sporting Debt
Financing and pay the Sporting Dividend Amount to ATK in the form of the cash
dividend declared by Sporting prior to the consummation of the Distribution.
ATK shall

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

use the entirety of the Sporting Dividend Amount received pursuant to this
Section 2.04 to promptly repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise extinguish
existing Indebtedness of ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries.

The Merger

  


 

  

SECTION 3.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Orbital. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate

extent permitted by Law, waiver by the parties entitled to the benefit
thereof) of the conditions set forth in Article IX; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article IX, if the proceeds of the New Sporting Debt Financing are not then
available in full pursuant to the Sporting Commitment Letter or any
replacement thereof (or if definitive agreements have been entered into with
respect to the New Sporting Debt Financing, pursuant to such definitive
agreements) on the date that would otherwise be the Closing Date, ATK and
Orbital shall not be required to effect the Closing until such date on which
the proceeds of the New Sporting Debt Financing are available in full pursuant
to the Sporting Commitment Letter or any replacement thereof (or if definitive
agreements have been entered into with respect to the New Sporting Debt
Financing, pursuant to such definitive agreements). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at such other place, time or date as
shall be agreed in writing between ATK and Orbital. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  


 

  

SECTION 3.03. Effective Time. On the Closing Date, ATK, Merger Sub and Orbital
shall file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware executed in accordance with, and
in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
later time as ATK and Orbital shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the DGCL. The time the Merger becomes effective is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

SECTION 3.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation of Orbital, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be amended at the Effective Time so as to read in its entirety in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of
Orbital, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended at the Effective Time so as to read in its entirety in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B, and as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the

or by applicable Law. Each of ATK, Merger Sub and Orbital shall take all
action necessary to carry out the actions contemplated by this Section 3.05.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.06. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The

until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
as the case may be. Each of ATK, Merger Sub and Orbital shall take all action
necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 3.06.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IV

  


 

  

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

  


 

  

SECTION 4.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of ATK, Orbital, Merger Sub or the
holder of any Orbital Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:

  


 

  

(a) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

  


 

  

(b) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Orbital
("Orbital Common Stock") that is owned by Orbital as treasury stock and each
share of Orbital Common Stock that is owned by ATK or Merger Sub (in each
case, if any) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

  


 

  

(c) subject to Section 4.02, each share of Orbital Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 4.01(b)) shall be converted into the
right to receive that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of ATK
Common Stock equal to the Merger Exchange Ratio (the "Merger

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Consideration"). All such shares of Orbital Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") or evidence
of shares in book-entry form that, in each case, immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Orbital Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of ATK Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or
other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of
such Certificate (or evidence of shares of Orbital Common Stock held in book-
entry form) in accordance with Section 4.02, without interest. For purposes of
this Agreement, "ATK Common Stock" means the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of ATK. As provided in Section 4.04, the right of the holders of the
shares of Orbital Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax
Law.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.02. Distribution of Merger Consideration. (a) Deposit of ATK Common
Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time, ATK shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the shares of
Orbital Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article IV through
the Agent, certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing
the shares of ATK Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration and cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
4.02(f). All such ATK Common Stock and cash deposited with the Agent for
purposes of paying the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article IV is
hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Exchange Fund". ATK shall instruct the
Agent to keep the Merger Exchange Fund segregated from the Sporting Common
Stock deposited with the Agent in connection with the Distribution.

  


 

  

(b) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, ATK shall cause the Agent to mail to each holder of record of Orbital
Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal")
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates (or shares of Orbital Common Stock held in book-
entry form) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or shares of
Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form) to the Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as ATK may reasonably specify), together with instructions
thereto. Prior to causing the Agent to mail the Letter of Transmittal, ATK
shall give Orbital and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Orbital and its counsel.

  


 

  

(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the
case of shares of Orbital Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancelation to the Agent, or (ii) in the
case of shares of Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of
an "agent's message" by

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly,
completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Agent, the
holder of such shares of Orbital Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration which the holder of such shares
of Orbital Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4.01 and
(ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 4.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other
distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
4.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Orbital Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of Orbital, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of ATK Common Stock pursuant to
Section 4.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 4.02(f) and in respect of any dividends
or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 4.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Orbital Common Stock (or, if such Orbital Common Stock is held in book-
entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.02(c), each share of Orbital
Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any
time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of
Orbital Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares
pursuant to Section 4.01 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 4.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 4.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Orbital Common
Stock held in book-entry form).

  


 

  

(d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to ATK Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
(or shares of Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form) with respect to
the shares of ATK Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to Section 4.02(f), until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of
Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article
IV. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of
any such Certificate (or shares of Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry
form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole
shares of ATK Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of ATK Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 4.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of ATK Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of ATK Common Stock.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Orbital Common Stock. The shares of ATK
Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Article
IV upon conversion of any shares of Orbital Common Stock (including any cash
paid pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section 4.02) shall be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Orbital Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Orbital Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Orbital Common Stock (or shares
of Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to ATK or the
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article IV.

  


 

  

(f) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of ATK Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Orbital
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Orbital Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of ATK Common Stock (after taking into account all shares
of Orbital Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the last reported sale price of ATK Common Stock on the NYSE (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by ATK and Orbital) on the last
complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(g) Termination of Merger Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Merger Exchange
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Orbital Common Stock for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to ATK, upon demand, and any holder of
Orbital Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to ATK for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article IV, in
each case without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

(h) No Liability. None of Orbital, ATK, Merger Sub, Sporting or the Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Merger Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates (or shares of
Orbital Common Stock held in book-entry form) for two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of ATK, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(i) Investment of Merger Exchange Fund. The Agent shall invest any cash in the
Merger Exchange Fund as directed by ATK. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to ATK.

  


 

  

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by ATK, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as
ATK may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Agent shall issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.03. Adjustments to Orbital Equity Awards Relating to the Merger. (a)
As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Board of Directors of
ATK (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the ATK Stock Plans) and
the Board of Directors of Orbital (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Orbital Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

  


 

  

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Orbital Options, whether vested or
unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Orbital
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Orbital Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number
of shares of ATK Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Orbital Common Stock subject
to such Orbital Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Merger
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of ATK Common Stock (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of
Orbital Common Stock of such Orbital Option divided by (B) the Merger Exchange
Ratio (a "Converted Stock Option"); and

  


 

  

(ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Orbital RSUs as necessary to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each Orbital RSU outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Orbital RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of
ATK Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Orbital
Common Stock subject to such Orbital RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Merger Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share (a
"Converted RSU").

  


 

  

The adjustments provided in this Section 4.03(a) with respect to Orbital
Options, whether or not such Orbital Options are "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Code Section 422), are intended to be effected in a manner that is
consistent with Code Section 424(a) and Code Section 409A.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, ATK shall assume all the obligations of Orbital
under the Orbital Stock Plans, each outstanding Converted Option and Converted
RSU and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof.

  


 

  

(c) ATK shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of ATK Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or
settlement of the Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs in accordance
with this Section 4.03(c). As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Distribution, ATK shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or, to the extent applicable, other appropriate form) with respect
to the ATK Common Stock subject to Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs remain
outstanding.

  


 

  

(d) The Board of Directors of Orbital (or if appropriate, any committee
administering the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with
respect to the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan: (A) participants in the
Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP Participants") may not increase
their payroll deductions under the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan from
those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (B) no new ESPP Participants
may commence participation in the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan
following the date of this Agreement; (C) all participation in and purchases
under the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be suspended effective as
of June 30, 2014 (the "ESPP Suspension Date"), such that the offering period
in effect as of the date of this Agreement will be the final offering period
under the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan until otherwise determined by
ATK after the Effective Time; and (D) with respect to any offering period
under the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan in effect as of the date of the
Agreement, Orbital shall ensure that such offering period ends at the ESPP
Suspension Date and that each ESPP Participant's accumulated contributions for
such offering period are applied to the purchase of Orbital Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan unless
the ESPP Participant has previously withdrawn from such offering period in
accordance with the terms of the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any
cash remaining in the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan after purchases
occurring on the ESPP Suspension Date shall be refunded to ESPP Participants
promptly following the ESPP Suspension Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.04. Withholding Rights. Each of ATK, Orbital and the Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

Effect. Each Subsidiary of Orbital has all requisite power and authority
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and

the authorized capital stock of Orbital consists of 200,000,000 shares of
Orbital Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share (the "Orbital Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on
April 24, 2014 (the "Capitalization Date"), (i) 60,568,206 shares of Orbital
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, none of which were subject to
vesting or other forfeiture conditions or repurchase by Orbital, (ii) no
shares of Orbital Common Stock were held by Orbital in its treasury, (iii)
2,426,972 shares of Orbital Common Stock were reserved and available for
issuance pursuant to Orbital Stock Plans, of which (A) 70,000 shares were
issuable upon exercise of outstanding Orbital Options and (B) 951,538 shares
were issuable upon vesting of outstanding Orbital RSUs, (iv) 305,703 shares of
Orbital Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the
Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (v) no shares of Orbital Preferred Stock
were issued and outstanding and (vi) no shares of Orbital Preferred Stock were

Stock are, and all such shares which may be issued prior to the Effective Time
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to
or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Orbital
or any Orbital Material Contract. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of Orbital having the right to vote (or convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which holders of Orbital Common Stock may vote ("Voting Orbital Debt"). Except
as set forth above, as of the Capitalization Date, (i) there were no shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, Orbital issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding and (ii) there were no options, rights,
warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock or other
equity rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts or
undertakings of any kind to which Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries was a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets was bound (A)
obligating Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, or any security convertible or
exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity or
voting interests in, Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries or any Voting Orbital
Debt, (B) obligating Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such option, right, warrant, security, commitment,
Contract, arrangement or undertaking

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

or (C) that give any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right
similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to
holders of Orbital Common Stock or the holders of the capital stock of any
Subsidiary of Orbital (the items in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively,
"Orbital Securities"). From the Capitalization Date through the date of this
Agreement, neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any Orbital
Securities, other than pursuant to Orbital Options, Orbital RSUs or rights to
purchase Orbital Common Stock under the Orbital Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
in each case, that were outstanding as of the Capitalization Date. There are
not any outstanding Contracts of any kind that obligate Orbital or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Orbital
Securities.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. (a) Orbital
has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver each Transaction
Document to which it is or is contemplated to be a party, to perform its
obligations thereunder and to consummate the Merger Transactions. The
execution and delivery by Orbital of each Transaction Document to which it is
or is contemplated to be a party and the consummation by Orbital of the Merger
Transactions have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Orbital,
and except for the Orbital Stockholder Approval, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Orbital are necessary to authorize the Transaction
Documents to which it is or is contemplated to be a party or the consummation
of the Merger Transactions. Orbital has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against Orbital in accordance with its terms (except
insofar as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies). Upon the execution and delivery by Orbital of each other
Transaction Document to which it is or is contemplated to be a party, and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
thereto, each other Transaction Document to which it is or is contemplated to
be a party will constitute its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies).

  


 

  

(b) In resolutions adopted on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of Orbital has (i) determined that the Merger, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, is fair to and in the best
interests of Orbital and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement, each other Transaction Document to which Orbital is
or is contemplated to be a party and the Merger Transactions, (iii) resolved,
subject to Section 8.14(d), to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the
holders of Orbital Common Stock and (iv) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Orbital Common Stock for their adoption, which
resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any
way.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) The only vote or consent of holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Orbital necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger
Transactions is the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Orbital Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the
Orbital Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or recess
thereof (the "Orbital Stockholder Approval").

  


 

  

(d) Orbital is not party to any stockholder rights agreement, "poison pill" or
similar anti-takeover agreement or plan. The Board of Directors of Orbital has
adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Merger Transactions the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth
in Section 203 of the DGCL. No "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation applicable
to Orbital enacted under the Law of the State of Delaware or under the Law of
any other jurisdiction applies to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Merger Transactions.

  


 

  

(e) The Board of Directors of Orbital (or if appropriate, any committee
administering the Orbital Stock Plans) has adopted, or will adopt prior to the
consummation of the Merger Transactions, such resolutions or taken such other
actions as may be required to ensure that, except as explicitly set forth in
this Agreement or as set forth in agreements in existence on the date hereof
and set forth on Section 5.04(e) of the Orbital Disclosure Letter, no Orbital
equity awards will become vested or exercisable as a result of the
consummation of the Merger Transactions.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.05. No Conflicts; Governmental Approvals. (a) The execution and
delivery by Orbital of each Transaction Document to which it is a party does
not, the execution and delivery by Orbital of each Transaction Document to
which it is contemplated to be a party will not, and the consummation of the
Merger Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which
Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings,
consents and other matters referred to in Section 5.05(b), any Judgment or Law
applicable to Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above,
any such item that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) No Governmental Approval is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of any Transaction Document to which it is
a party or the consummation of the Merger Transactions, other than (i)
compliance with and filings

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

and approvals under the HSR Act and the other Review Laws set forth in Section
5.05(b)(i) of the Orbital Disclosure Letter, (ii) the filing with the SEC of
the Joint Proxy Statement in definitive form, the filing with the SEC, and
declaration of effectiveness under the Securities Act, of the ATK Form S-4,
and compliance with and such other filings under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with the Merger Transactions,
(iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger and any other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (iv) compliance by Orbital with
the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (v) compliance with and filings and
approvals under any applicable international, Federal or state securities or
"blue sky" Laws and (vi) such other Governmental Approvals, the failure of
which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse
Effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.06. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Orbital has filed
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed by Orbital with the SEC since January 1, 2011 pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Orbital SEC Documents"). As of its
respective effective date (in the case of any Orbital SEC Document that is a
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act) and as of its
respective filing date (in the case of any other Orbital SEC Document), each
Orbital SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and none of the
Orbital SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Orbital makes no
representation or warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
ATK or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or, if applicable, any other filing
contemplated by Section 8.01. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
material outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect
to any of the Orbital SEC Documents.

  


 

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of Orbital included or incorporated by reference
in the Orbital SEC Documents (collectively, the "Orbital Financial
Statements") (i) were derived from the books of account and other financial
records of Orbital and its Subsidiaries, (ii) present fairly in all material
respects the financial position of Orbital and its consolidated Subsidiaries
and the consolidated results of their operations and changes in cash flows as
of the dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case
of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

which are expected to be material), (iii) were prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied in all material respects on a consistent basis during the
periods covered (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject,
in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments, none of which are expected to be material) and (iv) meet
the requirements of Regulation S-X in all material respects.

  


 

  

(c) Except as reflected or reserved against on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of Orbital included in the Orbital Financial Statements filed
with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (together with the notes
thereto, the "Orbital Balance Sheet"), Orbital and its Subsidiaries do not
have any Liabilities of any nature other than Liabilities that (i) were
incurred after the date of the Orbital Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) are contemplated by or were incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the Merger Transactions or (iii)
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(d) (A) Orbital maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and (B) Orbital has disclosed since
January 1, 2011, to Orbital's auditors and the audit committee of Orbital's
Board of Directors, (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Orbital's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (2) any fraud, to the knowledge of Orbital,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Orbital's internal control over financial reporting.
Orbital has made available to ATK all such disclosures made by management to
Orbital's auditors and audit committee from January 1, 2011 to the date of
this Agreement. Orbital's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have made, with respect to Orbital's SEC Documents, all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC. Orbital has not identified any material weaknesses in
the design or operation of the internal controls over financial reporting.
Neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged
any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers of
Orbital within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Orbital for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statements or any other filing
contemplated by Section 8.01 will, at the time each such document is filed
with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act (in
the case of the Registration Statements) or in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement, at the date of mailing and at the date of the applicable
stockholders meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading. The Registration Statements and the Joint Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act except that no representations or warranty
is made by Orbital with respect to statements included or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of ATK

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

and its Subsidiaries (including Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries) for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the
Orbital Balance Sheet through the date of this Agreement, (i) there has not
been an Orbital Material Adverse Effect or any effect, change, event or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) except in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger Transactions or as expressly
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
to which Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (x) Orbital and each
of its Subsidiaries has conducted its business in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business and (y) neither Orbital nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action which if taken after the date hereof would
require ATK's consent pursuant to any of clause (a), clauses (c) through (n)
or clauses (q) through (s) of Section 7.01.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.09. Taxes. (a) Except for those matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an
Orbital Material Adverse Effect:

  


 

  

(i) all Tax Returns relating to the Orbital Business, Orbital and each of its
Subsidiaries required to be filed have been timely filed;

  


 

  

(ii) all such Tax Returns are true and complete in all respects;

  


 

  

(iii) Orbital and each of its Subsidiaries has timely paid or withheld all
Taxes required to be paid or withheld; and

  


 

  

(iv) no Liens for Taxes exist and no outstanding claims for Taxes have been
asserted in writing against Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) The Orbital Balance Sheet reflects an adequate reserve in accordance with
GAAP for all Taxes payable by Orbital and its Subsidiaries (in addition to any
reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
items).

  


 

  

(c) No audit or other Action with respect to material Taxes or Tax Returns of
Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries is currently in progress, and no deficiency
for any material amount of Tax has been asserted or assessed by a Governmental
Entity against Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been settled,
paid or withdrawn.

  


 

  

(d) In the five years prior to the date hereof, neither Orbital nor any
Subsidiary of Orbital (i) has been a member of an affiliated group (or similar
state, local or foreign filing group) filing a consolidated U.S. Federal
income Tax Return other than with Orbital or one of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
has any material Liability for the Taxes of any Person other than Orbital or
one of its Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) Neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any material
agreement or arrangement the primary purpose of which relates to Taxes (other
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Orbital and
its Subsidiaries).

  


 

  

(f) Within the past two years, neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
the Code (other than in connection with the Distribution).

  


 

  

(g) Neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries has, to the knowledge of
Orbital, "participated" in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4.

  


 

  

(h) Neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that
prevents, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, the applicable
Transactions from qualifying for the applicable Intended Tax Treatment.

  


 

  

(i) Except to the extent Sections 5.10, 5.11(c)(i) and 5.15(a)(i)(C) concern
Tax matters, this Section 5.09 contains the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of Orbital with respect to Tax matters.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.10. Employee Benefits Matters. (a) Section 5.10(a) of the Orbital
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a true and complete list
of each material Orbital Benefit Plan. Orbital has made available to ATK true
and complete copies of (i) each Orbital Benefit Plan required to be listed in
Section 5.10(a) of the Orbital Disclosure Letter (or, in the case of any
unwritten Orbital Benefit Plan required to be listed in Section 5.10(a) of the
Orbital Disclosure Letter, a description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual
report on Form 5500 filed with respect to each such Orbital Benefit Plan (if
any such report was required), (iii) the most recent summary plan description
for each such Orbital Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is
required, (iv) the most recent actuarial valuation report, if any, for each
such Orbital Benefit Plan and (v) all material correspondence with a
Governmental Entity relating to such Orbital Benefit Plan since January 1,
2011.

  


 

  

 

(b) The Orbital Benefit Plans have been administered in compliance with their
terms and applicable Law, other than any instances of non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect, (i) no Orbital Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan", as described in Section 3(1)
of ERISA (each, an "Orbital Welfare Plan"), is funded or insured through a
"welfare benefits fund", as such term is defined in Code Section 419(e), (ii)
each Orbital Welfare Plan that is a "group health plan", as such term is
defined in Code Section 5000(b)(1),

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

complies with the applicable requirements of Code Section 4980B(f), (iii) each
Orbital Welfare Plan (in each case including any such plan covering retirees
or other former employees) may be amended or terminated without liability to
Orbital and its Subsidiaries, other than for claims incurred prior to the date
of such termination, on or at any time after the Effective Time and (iv) no
Orbital Welfare Plan provides health or life insurance benefits after
termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by
the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents).

  


 

  

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect, each Orbital Benefit
Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA (each, an "Orbital Pension Plan"), and that is intended to be tax
qualified has been the subject of determination letters from the IRS with
respect to all Tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS has provided a
current determination letter to the effect that such Orbital Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from Federal income Taxes under Code Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor,
to the knowledge of Orbital, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such
Orbital Pension Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or require
"security" within the meaning of Section 307 of ERISA.

  


 

  

(e) No Orbital Pension Plan had, as of the respective last annual valuation
date for each such Orbital Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability", as
such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, based on actuarial
assumptions that have been made available to ATK, except for instances that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect. None of the Orbital
Pension Plans subject to the minimum funding requirements of Code Section 412
or Section 302 of ERISA or any trust established thereunder has failed to
satisfy the "minimum funding standards" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA or
Code Section 412), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most
recently ended fiscal year of such Orbital Pension Plan, except for instances
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect. None of Orbital or any
of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of Orbital, any Orbital Employee or
any trustee, fiduciary or administrator of any Orbital Benefit Plan or trust
thereunder, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as such term is defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Code Section 4975, or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility that would reasonably be expected to subject Orbital, any
Subsidiary of Orbital or any Orbital Employee to the tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by such Code Section 4975 or to any liability
under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA, except to the extent that any such
taxes or penalties, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect. None of
such Orbital Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, nor has there been
any "reportable event", as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, with
respect to any Orbital Benefit Plan during the last five years, except to the
extent that any such reportable

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

events, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(f) The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document to which Orbital
or any Subsidiary of Orbital is a party do not, and the consummation of the
Merger Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
either alone or in connection with any other event, (i) entitle any Orbital
Employee to severance, termination, change in control or similar pay or
benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable under or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to, any Orbital Benefit Plan or (iii) result in
any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Orbital Benefit Plan, in
each case, except for any payments or benefits required by applicable Law.

  


 

  

(g) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the Merger Transactions by
any director, officer, manager or employee of Orbital or any of its
Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual", as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, under any Orbital Benefit Plan or other
compensation arrangement would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment", as such term is defined in Code Section 280G(b)(1), and no such
disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment
(including any Tax gross up or other payment) from Orbital, any Subsidiary of
Orbital or any other Person in the event that the excise Tax required by Code
Section 4999(a) is imposed on such disqualified individual.

   
 

  

SECTION 5.11. Labor Matters. (a) Except as set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the
Orbital Disclosure Letter, (i) neither Orbital nor any of its Subsidiaries is
party to any collective bargaining agreement or any other Contract with any
labor union, organization or works council (each such agreement or Contract, a
"CBA") and no Orbital Employees are represented by any labor union,
organization or works council with respect to their employment with Orbital or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) Since January 1, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no
labor unions or works councils purporting to represent or attempting to
represent any employees employed by Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries, nor to
the knowledge of Orbital is there any pending or threatened application for
certification of a collective bargaining agent seeking to represent any
employees of Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries or any pending union or works
council representation election, (ii) to the knowledge of Orbital there has
not been nor is there threatened any labor strike, work stoppage, organized
slowdown, picketing or concerted refusal to work overtime by, or lockout of,
any employees of Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to the
Orbital Business, (iii) Orbital has not received written notice or threat of,
and there are not pending to the knowledge of Orbital, any unfair labor
practice charges against the Orbital Business before the National Labor
Relations Board or any similar state, local or foreign governmental entity,
and (iv) Orbital has not received written notice or threat of, and, to the
knowledge of Orbital, there are not pending, any suits, actions or other
proceedings in connection with the Orbital Business alleging violation of any
Laws

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

pertaining to labor relations or employment matters, including any charge or
complaint filed by an employee before the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any similar state, local or foreign governmental entity
responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices, and any
lawsuit alleging violation of applicable federal, state or local labor or
employment Laws (including human rights Laws), except, in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) above, for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an Orbital Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(c) (i) Orbital and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Laws relating to labor, employment, and fair employment practices, including
all Laws respecting workers' compensation, terms and conditions of employment,
applicant and employee background checking, health and welfare, retirement or
other savings or insurance contributions, plant closings, worker
classification, affirmative action, equal pay, worker safety, wages and hours,
civil rights (including discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and equal
employment opportunity), leaves of absence, disability rights or benefits,
notice of termination, discrimination, immigration, withholding of Taxes,
collective bargaining, and any other statutory or other obligations owed to
employees under applicable Law, and (ii) neither Orbital nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any Liability, including under or on account of an Orbital
Benefit Plan, arising out of the hiring of Persons to provide services to
Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such Persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of Orbital or any of its

filing date (in the case of any other ATK SEC Document), each ATK SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and none of the ATK SEC Documents as

position of ATK and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results
of their operations and changes in cash flows as of the dates thereof and for

Business and the results of operations as of the dates thereof and for the
periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of the 2015 Interim ATK Business
Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments, none of which are
expected to be material).

  


 

  

(e) Except as reflected or reserved against on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of ATK included in the ATK Financial Statements filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (together with the notes thereto, the
"ATK Balance Sheet"), ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries do not have any Liabilities
of any nature other than Liabilities that (i) were incurred after the date of

financial information and (2) any fraud, to the knowledge of ATK, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in ATK's internal control over financial reporting. ATK has

auditors and audit committee from January 1, 2011 to the date of this
Agreement. ATK's principal executive officer and principal financial officer

party, (x) ATK and each of the ATK Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business and (y) neither ATK nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action

(i) Except to the extent Sections 6.11, 6.12(c)(i) and 6.16(a)(i)(C) concern
Tax matters, this Section 6.10 contains the sole and exclusive representations

Letter, a description thereof), (ii) the most

description for each such ATK Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required, (iv) the most recent actuarial valuation report, if

expected to have an ATK Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have an ATK Material Adverse Effect, (i) no ATK Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan", as described in Section 3(1) of
ERISA (each, an "ATK Welfare Benefit Plan"), is funded or insured through a
"welfare benefits fund", as such term is defined in Code Section 419(e), (ii)

defined in Code Section 5000(b)(1), complies with the applicable requirements

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have an ATK Material Adverse Effect, each ATK Benefit Plan that
is an "employee pension benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA
(each, an "ATK Pension Benefit Plan"), and that is intended to be tax
qualified has been the subject of determination letters from the IRS with
respect to all Tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS has provided a
current determination letter to the effect that such ATK Pension Benefit Plans
are qualified and exempt from Federal income Taxes under Code Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, and no such determination letter has been revoked
nor, to the knowledge of ATK, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such
ATK Pension Benefit Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or require
"security" within the meaning of Section 307 of ERISA.

  


 

  

(e) No ATK Pension Benefit Plan had, as of the respective last annual
valuation date for each such ATK Pension Benefit Plan, an "unfunded benefit
liability", as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, based on
actuarial assumptions that have been made available to Orbital, except for
instances that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an ATK Material Adverse Effect. None of the ATK
Pension Benefit Plans subject to the minimum funding requirements of Code
Section 412 or Section 302 of ERISA or any trust

waived, as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal year of such ATK
Pension Benefit Plan, except for instances that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an ATK
Material Adverse Effect. None of ATK or any ATK Subsidiary, or, to the
knowledge of ATK, any ATK Employee or any trustee, fiduciary or administrator
of any ATK Benefit Plan or trust thereunder, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction", as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Code Section
4975, or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that would reasonably be
expected to subject ATK, any ATK Subsidiary or any ATK Employee to the tax or
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Code Section 4975 or to any
liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA, except to the extent that
any such taxes or penalties, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have an ATK Material Adverse Effect.
None of such ATK Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, nor has there
been any "reportable event", as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA,
with respect to any ATK Benefit Plan during the last five years, except to the
extent that any such reportable events, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an ATK Material Adverse
Effect.

  


 

  

(f) The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document to which ATK or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party do not, and the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not, either
alone or in connection with any other event, (i) entitle any ATK Employee to
severance, termination, change in control or similar pay or benefits, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable under or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any ATK Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any breach or violation
of, or a default under, any ATK Benefit Plan, in each case, except for any

practices, and any lawsuit alleging violation of applicable federal, state or
local labor or employment Laws (including human rights Laws), except, in the

Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, for

the extent any of them expires in accordance with its terms), and neither ATK
nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated any provisions of, or committed or
failed to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default under the provisions of any ATK Material Contract,
except for any violation or default that, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an ATK Material
Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of each written ATK Material
Contract, and a summary of each oral ATK Material Contract, listed in Section

acquire any shares of Orbital Common Stock.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.20. Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of ATK has

assumptions set forth therein,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56

the case of this clause (y), the withholding party first uses commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner that does not

Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
disclosing party, its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives;
provided that such source is reasonably believed by the receiving party not to
be subject to an obligation of confidentiality (whether by agreement or
otherwise) to the other party, or (3) was independently developed by the
receiving party, its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives
without reference to, incorporation of, or other use of any Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person may disclose
Confidential Information as required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any U.S. national
securities exchange (provided that the disclosing party shall promptly notify
ATK or Sporting, as applicable, of any requests for such disclosure and
reasonably cooperate with such party (at such party's sole expense) to
preserve the confidentiality of such information to the extent consistent with
applicable Law, court process or such listing agreement with any U.S. national
securities exchange).

subject of Section 8.04(b) and Section 8.04(c). In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, ATK and Orbital shall use reasonable best efforts to

or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each of
the parties hereto shall keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed of
its progress in obtaining any necessary or advisable Consents and Governmental
Approvals pursuant to this Section 8.04(a).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall (i) file, or cause to be filed, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but no later than 30
days after the date hereof, all notification and report forms that may be
required under the HSR Act or other antitrust, competition or pre-merger
notification, trade regulation Law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction
(collectively, "Review Laws") with respect to the Transactions, (ii) supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other applicable Review Law and (iii) subject to Section 8.04(c),
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Review Laws and to obtain all Governmental Approvals under any Review Laws
that may be required by any Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction,
so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions. To the extent necessary
in order to comply with clause (iii) of the foregoing sentence and subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.04(c), ATK and Orbital shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to jointly negotiate, commit to and effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by
ATK, Orbital or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any portion of the
business, properties or assets of ATK, Orbital or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither ATK nor Orbital shall be
required pursuant to this Section 8.04(b) to commit to or effect any action
that is not conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions. Each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a Governmental Entity by any Person
relating to any Review Laws in connection with the Transactions and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Entity relating to any Review Laws in connection with the Transactions, and
each of the parties hereto shall keep the other parties reasonably informed of
its progress in obtaining any necessary or advisable Governmental Approvals
relating to Review Laws in connection with the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Law, and to the extent reasonably practicable, each of the parties
hereto shall consult with the other parties hereto in advance with respect to
any written materials submitted to any Governmental Entity, and, to the extent
permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity and to the extent reasonably
practicable, shall give the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meetings and conferences with Governmental Entities, in
each case in connection with the matters contemplated by this Section 8.04(b).
None of the parties hereto shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Review Law or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the Transactions
except with the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which reasonableness shall be
determined in light of each party's obligation, subject to Section 8.04(c), to
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and any other applicable Review Laws and to obtain all
Governmental Approvals under any Review Laws, so as to enable

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the parties hereto to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions).

  


 

  

(c) Nothing in Section 8.04(a) or 8.04(b) shall be construed to (i) require
any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries to pay any
consideration to any third party from whom any Consent or Governmental
Approval is requested, other than filing fees paid to Governmental Entities,
(ii) require ATK or any of its Subsidiaries to sell, divest or dispose of (or
offer or commit to sell, divest or dispose of) any of the assets, properties,
rights or claims of the Sporting Business or to otherwise offer, take, commit
to or accept any other action, restriction or limitation with respect to the
Sporting Business or (iii) require or permit ATK, Orbital or their respective
Subsidiaries to sell, divest or dispose of (or offer or commit to sell, divest
or dispose of) any asset, property, right or claim or to otherwise offer,
take, commit to or accept any action, restriction or limitation of or on ATK,
Orbital or their respective Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of
the other party if (1) in the case of any such action with respect to the
assets, properties, rights or claims of the defense business of ATK or
Orbital, such action would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the defense businesses of ATK and/or Orbital, taken as a whole, or
(2) in the case of any such action with respect to the assets, properties,
rights or claims of the aerospace business of ATK or Orbital, such action
would require the divestiture or disposal of any business, division or program
that generates annual revenues in excess of $100.0 million (determined based
on revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year of ATK or Orbital, as
applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement).

  


 

  

SECTION 8.05. Rights Under ATK Insurance Policies. In the event that the
Sporting Business (including any asset, property, claim or right to be held by
Sporting or a Sporting Subsidiary after giving pro forma effect to the
Sporting Transfers) suffers or has suffered any damage, destruction or other
casualty loss or any other liability that is insured under any insurance
policy held by ATK or an ATK Subsidiary (collectively, the "ATK Insurance
Policies") and arises or has arisen prior to the Distribution Date, ATK shall,
or shall cause the appropriate ATK Subsidiary to, in each case to the extent
permitted under the applicable ATK Insurance Policy, (i) assert a claim under
the appropriate ATK Insurance Policy, (ii) surrender to Sporting after the
Distribution Date any insurance proceeds received by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary
under any ATK Insurance Policy with respect to such damage, destruction or
casualty loss, less (A) any amount of such insurance proceeds applied by ATK
or any ATK Subsidiary to the physical restoration of such asset, (B) the
amount of all applicable deductibles and co-payment provisions and all
payment, reinsurance or reimbursement obligations of ATK or any ATK Subsidiary
in respect thereof and (C) the amount of ATK's and each ATK Subsidiary's
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any, incurred in connection
with the foregoing, and (iii) assign to Sporting after the Distribution Date
all rights of ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries with respect to any causes of
action (other than the rights with respect to causes of actions under the ATK
Insurance Policies, which are hereby expressly retained by ATK), whether or
not litigation has commenced as of the Distribution Date, in connection with
such damage, destruction or casualty loss. Sporting will use commercially
reasonable efforts to acquire, on or as soon as practicable following the
Distribution Date, insurance coverage with respect to the Sporting Business

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

for damage, destruction or other casualty loss or any other liability
occurring prior to the Distribution Date, as described in the immediately
preceding sentence, and ATK will, until the one-year anniversary of the
Distribution Date and as requested by Sporting, use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Sporting in connection with the foregoing; provided that
Sporting shall promptly reimburse ATK for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary in connection with the
foregoing. During the eighteen months period following the Distribution Date
(or, if later, until the final resolution of any relevant claim relating to
the Sporting Business), ATK shall not, and shall cause all applicable ATK
Subsidiaries not to, amend, commute, terminate, buy out, extinguish liability
under or otherwise modify any ATK Insurance Policy in a manner that would
adversely affect Sporting's rights pursuant to this Section 8.05 in any
material respect; provided, however, that this sentence shall not require ATK
or any ATK Subsidiary to renew or keep from lapsing any ATK Insurance Policy.
Subject to ATK's and the ATK Subsidiaries' compliance with this Section 8.05,
neither ATK nor any ATK Subsidiary shall bear any Liability for the failure of
an insurer to pay any claim under any ATK Insurance Policy.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. No Use of Retained Names. Sporting shall, and shall cause the
Sporting Subsidiaries to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event (a) within 90 days after the Distribution Date, make all necessary
filings and take all other necessary actions to discontinue any references to
the Retained Names, including by taking any necessary action such that no
Sporting Subsidiary has a corporate name, or does business using a name, that
includes as part of its name a Retained Name, (b) within 180 days after the
Distribution Date, revise print advertising, product labeling and all other
information or other materials, including any Internet or other electronic
communications vehicles, to delete all references to the Retained Names and
(c) within 180 days after the Distribution Date, change signage and stationery
and otherwise discontinue use of the Retained Names. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries shall be permitted to hold,
use, transfer and sell inventory of Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary (after
giving effect to the Sporting Transfers) that is in existence on the
Distribution Date and that has packing or labeling bearing a Retained Name
until all such inventory is depleted. In no event shall Sporting or any
Sporting Subsidiary use any Retained Names after the Distribution in any
manner or for any purpose different from the use of such Retained Names by ATK
or any of its Subsidiaries during the 360-day period preceding the
Distribution Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.07. Distribution Employee Matters.

  


 

  

(a) Sporting Benefit Plans and ATK Benefit Plans.

  


 

  

(i) Effective as of the Distribution Date, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, (A) Sporting shall, or shall cause the applicable
Sporting Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with respect to each Sporting
Benefit Plan, and (B) each Continuing Sporting Employee and Sporting Former
Employee shall cease active participation in each ATK Benefit Plan.
Furthermore, effective as of the Distribution Date, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8.07, Sporting shall, or shall cause the applicable
Sporting

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities with respect to each replicated ATK
Benefit Plan for Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees
as set forth below in this Section 8.07 (such replicated plans and the
Sporting Benefit Plans shall be referred to as the "Post-Distribution Sporting
Benefit Plans").

  

  

(ii) Each Continuing Sporting Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in the Post-Distribution Sporting
Benefit Plan corresponding to the applicable ATK Benefit Plan, if any, in
which such Continuing Sporting Employee participated immediately before the
Distribution Date. For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the Post-Distribution
Sporting Benefit Plans, each Continuing Sporting Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with ATK and its Subsidiaries (and their
predecessors) before the Distribution Date, to the same extent as such
Continuing Sporting Employee was entitled, before the Distribution Date, to
credit for such service under any similar ATK Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Sporting Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Distribution Date, provided that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

  


 

  

(b) Cash Incentive Bonus Plans. ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries shall have paid,
prior to the Distribution Date, all amounts earned under each cash incentive
bonus plan with respect to each performance period concluding prior to April
1, 2014, other than any such amounts that were deferred by the applicable cash
incentive bonus plan participant. Without limiting the generality of Section
8.07(a), effective on or prior to the Distribution Date (i) ATK and the ATK
Subsidiaries shall, except as provided in Section 8.07(b)(ii)(B), be solely
responsible for, and shall assume or retain, as the case may be, all
Liabilities for annual and other short-term bonuses, commissions or other
incentive compensation earned by ATK Employees and ATK Former Employees with
respect to periods ending on or after April 1, 2014 and (ii) Sporting and the
Sporting Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for, and shall assume or
retain, as the case may be, all Liabilities for annual and other short-term
bonuses, commissions or other incentive compensation (A) earned by Continuing
Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees with respect to periods
ending on or after April 1, 2014 and (B) under each Sporting Benefit Plan that
is a cash based bonus, commission or other incentive compensation plan set
forth in Section 8.07(b) of the ATK Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

(c) Certain Welfare Benefits Matters.

  


 

  

(i) Effective as of the Distribution Date, Sporting shall establish certain
welfare benefit plans (such plans, the "Sporting Welfare Plans"). Each
Sporting Welfare Plan shall have terms and features (including benefit
coverage options and employer contribution provisions) that are substantially
identical to the applicable ATK Welfare Benefit Plan in which the Continuing
Sporting Employees participated immediately prior to the Distribution Date
(such ATK Welfare Benefit Plans collectively being the "ATK Welfare Plans"),
such that

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(for the avoidance of doubt) each ATK Welfare Plan is substantially replicated
by a Sporting Welfare Plan.

  


 

  

(ii) Effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, Sporting shall, or shall
cause the applicable Sporting Subsidiaries to, assume all Liabilities,
whenever incurred, of ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries to Continuing Sporting
Employees and Sporting Former Employees, their eligible dependents and their
other covered beneficiaries in respect of health insurance under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Sections 601 et seq. and
Sections 701 et seq. of ERISA, Code Section 4980B and Code Sections 9801 et
seq. and applicable state or similar Law (or as relates to similar domestic
partner coverages under an ATK Welfare Plan).

  


 

  

(iii) For purposes of each Sporting Welfare Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Sporting Employee,
Sporting shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the
applicable Sporting Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to,
(A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Sporting Welfare Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Sporting Employee and his or her eligible dependents or other covered
beneficiaries, and (B) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her eligible dependents or other covered beneficiaries during the
portion of the plan year of the ATK Welfare Plan ending on the date such
employee's participation in the corresponding Sporting Welfare Plan begins to
be taken into account under such Sporting Welfare Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her eligible dependents or other
covered beneficiaries for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Sporting Welfare Plan.

  


 

  

(iv) From and after the Distribution Date, ATK shall retain all Liabilities in
accordance with the ATK Welfare Plans for payment of all medical, dental,
vision, health, non-occupational short-term disability benefit and long-term
disability benefit claims (collectively, "Welfare Benefit Claims") incurred
under such plans prior to the Distribution Date with respect to any Continuing
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee (or any eligible dependent or
other covered beneficiary thereof), and Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries
shall not assume any Liability with respect to such Welfare Benefit Claims,
except that Sporting shall assume or retain, as the case may be, Liability for
such Welfare Benefit Claims to the extent required by applicable Law. From and
after the Distribution Date, Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries shall be
liable in accordance with the Sporting Welfare Plans for payment of all
medical, dental, vision, health, and long-term disability benefit claims
incurred under such plans from and after the Distribution Date with respect to
any Continuing Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee (or any eligible
dependent or other covered beneficiary thereof) (collectively, "Post-
Distribution Welfare Benefit Claims"), and ATK or the applicable ATK
Subsidiary shall not assume any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Liability with respect to such Post-Distribution Welfare Benefit Claims. For
purposes of the foregoing, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred as follows:
(A) life, accidental death and dismemberment, and business travel accident
insurance benefits and long-term disability benefits, upon the death,
disability or accident giving rise to such benefits, (B) health, dental and
prescription drug benefits (including in respect of any hospital confinement),
upon provision of such services, materials or supplies, and (C) non-
occupational short-term disability, upon the initiation of any claim for such
benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each non-occupational short-term
disability benefit claim incurred, or deemed incurred pursuant to this Section
8.07(c)(iv), with respect to any Continuing Sporting Employee or Sporting
Former Employee prior to the Distribution Date, Sporting shall, or shall cause
the applicable Sporting Subsidiaries to, reimburse ATK or the applicable ATK
Subsidiary (A) an amount equal to the value of each payment made by ATK or the
applicable ATK Subsidiary on or after the Distribution Date to such Continuing
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee on account of such non-
occupational short-term disability benefit claim and (B) as soon as reasonably
practicable after ATK or the applicable ATK Subsidiary has provided Sporting
or the applicable Sporting Subsidiary with written confirmation that ATK or
the applicable ATK Subsidiary has made such payments to such Continuing
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee.

  


 

  

(v) Workers' Compensation Benefits. From and after the Distribution Date,
Sporting shall assume Liability for payment of all claims for workers'
compensation benefits that are incurred prior to, on, or after the
Distribution Date with respect to any Continuing Sporting Employee or Sporting
Former Employee, and Sporting shall retain Liability for all claims for
workers' compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Distribution
Date to the extent such claims relate to a Sporting Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

(d) Paid Time Off. Effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, Sporting
shall, or shall cause the applicable Sporting Subsidiaries to, assume
Liability (i) for all vacation days (regular, supplemental or banked) accrued
or earned but not yet taken by each Continuing Sporting Employee as of the
Distribution Date (the "Accrued Vacation Days") and (ii) with respect to each
Continuing Sporting Employee who has sold all or a portion of his or her
Accrued Vacation Days pursuant to and in accordance with a policy of ATK or
any ATK Subsidiary prior to the Distribution Date, for supplemental payments
to such Continuing Sporting Employee in equal amounts over the remainder of
the calendar year in satisfaction of such sale (the "Sold PTO"). In the event
that a Continuing Sporting Employee is entitled under applicable Law or any
policy of ATK or any ATK Subsidiary to be paid in cash for any Accrued
Vacation Days or Sold PTO in connection with the occurrence of the
Distribution, Sporting or the applicable Sporting Subsidiary shall discharge
the Liability for such Accrued Vacation Days and Sold PTO.

  


 

  

(e) Flexible Spending Account Plans. Effective not later than the Distribution
Date, Sporting shall, or shall cause the Sporting Subsidiaries to, have in
effect flexible spending arrangements under a cafeteria plan qualifying under
Code

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 125 (the "New Flexible Spending Account Plan"), and from and after the
Distribution Date, Sporting shall be liable for all Liabilities and account
balances of the ATK Flexible Spending Account Plan maintained in the United
States with respect to Continuing Sporting Employees, Sporting Former
Employees and their respective dependents (the "ATK Flexible Spending Account
Plan"). From and after the Distribution Date, for the balance of the coverage
year (and any grace period) all claims for reimbursement which have not been
paid as of the Distribution Date shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms
of the New Flexible Spending Account Plan. As soon as practicable following
the Distribution Date, (i) ATK shall, or shall cause the ATK Subsidiaries to,
transfer to Sporting or the applicable Sporting Subsidiary an amount in cash
equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate contributions to the ATK
Flexible Spending Account Plan made by Continuing Sporting Employees and
Sporting Former Employees prior to the Distribution Date for the plan year in
which the Distribution Date occurs over the aggregate reimbursement payouts
made to Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees prior to
the Distribution Date for such year from such plan, and (ii) Sporting shall,
or shall cause the Sporting Subsidiaries to, (A) restore the account balances
of the Continuing Sporting Employees and the Sporting Former Employees to the
value as of the date immediately prior to the Distribution Date less any
reimbursement payouts made between the Distribution Date and the date ATK
causes such amounts to be transferred and (B) cause such amounts, plus any
additional amounts necessary to restore the account balances, to be credited
to each such Continuing Sporting Employee's and Sporting Former Employee's
account under the New Flexible Spending Account Plan. In connection with such
transfer, Sporting shall deem that such employees' deferral elections made
under the ATK Flexible Spending Account Plan for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs shall continue in effect under the New Flexible Spending
Account Plan for the remainder of the plan year in which the Distribution Date
occurs. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to Continuing Sporting
Employees and Sporting Former Employees from the ATK Flexible Spending Account
Plan prior to the Distribution Date for the plan year in which the
Distribution Date occurs exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions made
by the Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees to such
plan prior to the Distribution Date for such plan year, Sporting shall make a
payment equal to the value of such excess to ATK as soon as practicable
following Sporting's receipt of additional contributions from the applicable
Continuing Sporting Employee and Sporting Former Employee.

  


 

  

(f) ATK 401(k) Plan.

  


 

  

(i) Effective as of the Distribution Date, Sporting shall establish a defined
contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Code Section 401(k) (the "Sporting 401(k) Plan")
providing benefits to the Continuing Sporting Employees participating in any
tax-qualified defined contribution plan sponsored by ATK (the "ATK 401(k)
Plan") as of the Distribution Date and any Sporting Employees hired prior to
the Distribution Date but who had not yet begun participating in the ATK
401(k) Plan. Furthermore, such Sporting 401(k) Plan shall otherwise provide
benefits and features (including investment options) substantially identical
to those provided

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

under the ATK 401(k) Plan as of the date immediately prior to the Distribution
Date.

  


 

  

(ii) Immediately following the Distribution Date, and subject to ATK's receipt
of reasonably satisfactory evidence that the Sporting 401(k) Plan meets the
requirements of Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a), ATK shall cause to be
transferred from the ATK 401(k) Plan to the Sporting 401(k) Plan the assets
and Liabilities relating to the account balances of the individuals who are,
as of such date, Continuing Sporting Employees or Sporting Former Employees
(whether vested or unvested as of the Distribution Date), in accordance with
the requirements of all applicable laws, including the Code. From and after
the Distribution Date, Sporting shall administer the transferred accounts of
the Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees in the
Sporting 401(k) Plan and the accounts of any Sporting Employee and Sporting
Former Employee who becomes a participant in the Sporting 401(k) Plan after
the Distribution Date, in each case, in accordance with all applicable Laws,
including the Code; provided that ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries shall provide
assistance as is reasonably necessary for the administration of such accounts.
Such transfer of assets shall consist of cash, cash equivalents, property or
participant loan receivables equal to all the accrued benefit Liabilities
relating to all account balances referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 8.07(f), including such Liabilities for the beneficiaries of the
Sporting Employees and including such accrued benefit Liabilities arising
under any applicable qualified domestic relations order. From and after the
Distribution Date, neither ATK nor the ATK 401(k) Plan shall have any
Liability to provide such participants in the ATK 401(k) Plan whose balances
were transferred to the Sporting 401(k) Plan (or any of their beneficiaries)
with benefits under the ATK 401(k) Plan following the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

(iii) ATK shall permit each ATK Shared Services Employee who experiences a
Transition Period Employment Transfer to effect, and Sporting shall cause the
Sporting 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with applicable Law and the
terms of the Sporting 401(k) Plan and the ATK 401(k) Plan, a rollover of the
account balances of such ATK Shared Services Employee who experiences a
Transition Period Employment Transfer (including earnings through the date of
transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under the ATK
401(k) Plan if such rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law and
the terms of the Sporting 401(k) Plan and the ATK 401(k) Plan by such ATK
Shared Services Employee who experiences a Transition Period Employment
Transfer. Upon completion of a transfer of the account balances of any ATK
Shared Services Employee as described in this Section 8.07(f)(iii), Sporting
and/or the Sporting 401(k) Plan will be responsible for all Liabilities of ATK
under the ATK 401(k) Plan with respect to the applicable ATK Shared Services
Employee whose account balances were transferred to the Sporting 401(k) Plan
and his or her beneficiaries, and none of ATK, any ATK Subsidiary or the ATK
401(k) Plan shall have any Liability to provide such individual (or any of his
or her beneficiaries) with benefits under the ATK 401(k) Plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(g) ATK Qualified Pension Plans.

  


 

  

(i) No later than the Distribution Date, Sporting shall cause to be
established or maintained one or more defined benefit pension plans
(collectively, the "Sporting Pension Plans") that, subject to this Section
8.07(g), provide benefits that are substantially identical to those provided
by the ATK Pension Benefit Plans applicable to Continuing Sporting Employees,
Sporting Former Employees and their respective beneficiaries (the "ATK Pension
Plans") who participate in the ATK Pension Plans immediately prior to the
Distribution Date (collectively, the "Pension Participants"), based on the
terms of the ATK Pension Plans as of the Distribution Date. Each Sporting
Pension Plan shall be established or maintained for the benefit of each
Pension Participant and shall be qualified under Code Section 401(a), and the
trust which is a part of such plan shall be exempt from tax under Code Section
501(a). Each Pension Participant participating in an ATK Pension Plan as of
the Distribution Date shall become a participant in a Sporting Pension Plan as
of the Distribution Date. Each Sporting Pension Plan and the trust which is a
part of such plan (and any successor to such plan or trust) shall provide that
(i) the assets transferred to such Sporting Pension Plan from an ATK Pension
Plan shall be held by the trust which is a part of such Sporting Pension Plan
for the exclusive benefit of the participants in such plan, (ii) the accrued
benefits as of the Distribution Date of each Pension Participant may not be
decreased by amendment or otherwise and (iii) each Pension Participant shall
have the right to receive his or her benefit accrued through the Distribution
Date under the applicable ATK Pension Plan in any optional form provided under
such ATK Pension Plan.

  


 

  

(ii) As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, ATK shall cause
its actuary to calculate the Accrued Liability as of the end of the month that
includes the Distribution Date. The term "Accrued Liability" shall mean the
benefit obligation under each ATK Pension Plan for each Pension Participant on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions set forth in Section 8.07(g)(ii) of the
ATK Disclosure Letter. If the Accrued Liability of all participants and
beneficiaries (whether or not Pension Participants) under any ATK Pension Plan
is determined to be less than the fair market value of the assets of such ATK
Pension Plan as of the Distribution Date then ATK shall cause to be
transferred from the trust established as part of such ATK Pension Plan to a
trust established by Sporting as part of a Sporting Pension Plan cash or
assets (or a combination thereof) equal to the Accrued Liability for all
Pension Participants under such ATK Pension Plan, as determined as of the
Distribution Date. If the Accrued Liability of all participants and
beneficiaries (whether or not Pension Participants) under any ATK Pension Plan
is determined to be equal to or more than the fair market value of the assets
of such ATK Pension Plan as of the Distribution Date, then ATK shall cause its
actuary to determine the amount of assets allocable to the Accrued Liabilities
of the Pension Participants under such ATK Pension Plan based on Section 4044
of ERISA (the "Section 4044 Amount"), and ATK shall cause to be transferred
from the trust established as part of such ATK Pension Plan to a trust
established by Sporting as part of a Sporting Pension Plan cash or assets (or
a

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

combination thereof) equal to the Section 4044 Amount applicable to the
Pension Participants, as determined as of the Distribution Date, provided,
however, if the Accrued Liability of Pension Participants under any ATK
Pension Plan is determined to be less than three percent of the fair market
value of the assets of such ATK Pension Plan as of the Distribution Date,
ATK's actuary may determine that the amount transferred from any such ATK
Pension Plan to a Sporting Pension Plan shall be determined pursuant to the de
minimis rule under Section 414(l) of the Code and the related regulations
thereunder, and such amount shall be deemed to be the Section 4044 Amount for
purposes of such ATK Pension Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the transfers of assets and Liabilities
contemplated by this Section 8.07(g) shall be determined in accordance with
Code Section 414(l) and the related regulations (including the safe harbor
assumptions and methodology of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
("PBGC") as of the end of the month that includes the Distribution Date), and
the amount expressly called for to be transferred pursuant to this Section
8.07(g) shall be adjusted to the extent necessary for the approval of any
Governmental Entity (including the IRS and the PBGC) and to satisfy Code
Section 414(l) and the related regulations as well as Section 4044 of ERISA
and the related regulations. The amount finally determined in accordance with
the foregoing to be transferred from an ATK Pension Plan to a Sporting Pension
Plan shall be adjusted, as determined by ATK's actuary, to take into account
the actual investment return on the assets of such ATK Pension Plan from the
end of the month in which the Distribution Date occurs until the applicable
Pension Transfer Date and shall be decreased by any benefit payment made to a
Pension Participant under such ATK Pension Plan during such period.

  

  

(iii) Any transfer of assets from an ATK Pension Plan to a Sporting Pension
Plan shall be made as soon as practicable following the determination by ATK's
actuary of the applicable amount to be transferred, but in no event later than
120 days following the later of (A) the final determination of ATK's actuary
and (B) the Distribution Date (the date of each such transfer, a "Pension
Transfer Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transfer shall be made
until such time as ATK has been provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to
ATK that (i) the applicable Sporting Pension Plan satisfies the requirements
for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a), (ii) Sporting has established
a trust as part of such Sporting Pension Plan that is exempt from tax under
Code Section 501(a) and (iii) the parties have received all other approvals
from, and made all required filings to, all applicable Governmental Entities.
Unless ATK and Sporting agree otherwise, each Pension Transfer Date shall
occur on the last Business Day of a month. ATK's actuary shall be responsible
for the required actuarial certification under Code Section 414(l). As of each
Pension Transfer Date, Sporting and the applicable Sporting Pension Plan shall
assume all Liabilities of ATK, its Affiliates and the applicable ATK Pension
Plan with respect to the applicable Pension Participants under such ATK
Pension Plan and Sporting and such Sporting Pension Plan shall become, with
respect to each applicable Pension Participant, responsible for all benefits
due and acts, omissions and transactions under or in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

connection with such ATK Pension Plan, whether arising prior to, on or after
the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

(iv) The Accrued Liability and the Section 4044 Amount shall be determined by
an enrolled actuary designated by ATK, and ATK shall provide any actuary
designated by Sporting with information reasonably necessary to calculate the
Accrued Liability and the Section 4044 Amount and to verify that such
calculations have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and Section 8.07(g) of the ATK Disclosure Letter. Within 30 days
following receipt by Sporting's actuary of the calculation of the Accrued
Liability and the Section 4044 Amount, Sporting shall notify ATK in writing if
there is a good faith dispute between ATK's actuary and Sporting's actuary as
to the calculation of the Accrued Liability and the Section 4044 Amount. If
Sporting does not notify ATK of any good faith dispute within such 30 day
period, the determination of ATK's actuary shall become conclusive, final and
binding. If any such dispute remains unresolved for 30 days following ATK's
receipt of such written notification from Sporting (or within such longer
period as ATK and Sporting shall mutually agree), the chief financial officers
of ATK and Sporting shall endeavor to resolve the dispute during the 30-day
period that follows such 30-day (or longer) period. If such dispute remains
unresolved at the end of such 30-day period, ATK and Sporting shall select and
appoint an independent nationally recognized actuary mutually agreed upon by
the parties hereto in writing. The reasoned written decision of such actuary
shall be rendered within 30 days of such appointment and shall be conclusive
as to any dispute for which such actuary was appointed. The cost of such
actuary shall be divided equally between ATK and Sporting. Each of Sporting
and ATK shall be responsible for the cost of its own actuary.

  


 

  

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.07(g), the
Section 4044 Amount shall be determined without regard to amounts treated as a
separate account maintained for the payment of sickness, accident,
hospitalization, and medical expenses of retired employees, their spouses, and
their dependents ("Retiree Medical Benefits") as provided under Code Section
401(h) (the "Section 401(h) Account"). No assets shall be transferred from the
ATK Pension Plan to the Sporting Pension Plan from the Section 401(h) Account,
unless the Section 401(h) Account covers Retiree Medical Benefits to be
provided under a Sporting Post-Employment Welfare Plan, in which case a
transfer of Section 401(h) Account assets to the Sporting Pension Plan shall
occur at the same time as provided under Section 8.07(g)(iii), in an amount,
as determined by ATK's actuary, equal to the value of the Section 401(h)
Account at the applicable Pension Transfer Date multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the actuarial present value of Retiree Medical Benefits
expected at that time to be provided under a Sporting Post-Employment Welfare
Plan to Pension Participants who, as of immediately prior to the Distribution
Date, were participants in an ATK Pension Plan that included a Section 401(h)
Account, and the denominator of which is the sum of (A) the actuarial present
value of Retiree Medical Benefits expected at that time to be provided under a
Sporting Post-Employment Welfare

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Plan to Pension Participants who, as of immediately prior to the Distribution
Date, were participants in an ATK Pension Plan that included a Section 401(h)
Account and (B) the actuarial present value of Retiree Medical Benefits to be
provided under the ATK Post-Employment Welfare Plans to participants allocated
to the ATK Pension Plan. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence,
the actuarial present value of Retiree Medical Benefits shall be the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of such Retiree Medical
Benefits, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, based on the
assumptions used in ATK's most recent year-end accounting disclosures.

  


 

  

(vi) Sporting shall use its best efforts to qualify each Sporting Pension Plan
under Code Section 401(a), and Sporting and ATK shall reasonably cooperate to
make any and all filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental
Entities required to be made by ATK or Sporting as are appropriate in
effectuating the provisions of this Section 8.07(g) (including (i) IRS Forms
5310-A in respect of the transfers of assets and (ii) in the event that the
Transactions constitute a "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA and the related regulations) for which the 30-day notice has not
been waived, timely notification of the PBGC and filing of all reports
required in connection therewith).

  


 

  

(vii) From and after the Distribution, (A) Sporting and the Sporting
Subsidiaries shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all Liabilities
with respect to, or in any way related to, the Sporting Pension Plans, whether
accrued (or relating to services provided) before, on or after the
Distribution and (B) ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries shall be solely and
exclusively responsible for all Liabilities with respect to, or in any way
related to, the ATK Pension Plans, whether accrued (or relating to services
provided) before, on or after the Distribution (it being understood that ATK,
the ATK Subsidiaries and the ATK Pension Plans shall be solely and exclusively
responsible for the administration and payment of benefits with respect to the
applicable Pension Participants under the ATK Pension Plans until the
applicable Pension Transfer Date).

  


 

  

(viii) The parties hereto shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that the assets and Liabilities associated with the participation of
any ATK Shared Services Employee who experiences a Transition Period
Employment Transfer in the ATK Pension Plans shall be transferred to a
Sporting Pension Plan in accordance with the principles of this Section
8.07(g).

  


 

  

(h) ATK Nonqualified Pension and Retirement Plans.

  


 

  

(i) Effective on or prior to the Distribution, Sporting or any Sporting
Subsidiary shall establish certain nonqualified pension and retirement plans
(such plans, the "Sporting Nonqualified Plans") in accordance with this
Section 8.07(h). Each Sporting Nonqualified Plan shall have terms and features
(including benefit accrual formulas and employer contribution provisions) that
are substantially identical to the ATK Benefit Plans that are nonqualified
pension and retirement

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

plans applicable to Continuing Sporting Employees, Sporting Former Employees
and their respective beneficiaries who participated in such ATK Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Distribution Date (such ATK Benefit Plans
collectively being the "ATK Nonqualified Plans") such that (for the avoidance
of doubt) each ATK Nonqualified Plan is substantially replicated by a
corresponding Sporting Nonqualified Plan. Sporting and the Sporting
Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for taking all necessary, reasonable,
and appropriate actions to establish, maintain and administer the Sporting
Nonqualified Plans in compliance with applicable Law. Each Sporting
Nonqualified Plan shall assume Liability for all benefits accrued or earned
(whether or not vested) by Continuing Sporting Employees, Sporting Former
Employees and their respective beneficiaries under the corresponding ATK
Nonqualified Plan as of the Distribution Date. From and after the Distribution
Date, Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries shall be solely and exclusively
responsible for all Liabilities with respect to, or in any way related to, the
Sporting Nonqualified Plans, whether accrued (or relating to services
provided) before, on or after the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

(ii) Within 60 days after the Distribution Date, ATK shall cause its actuary
to determine the value, as of the Distribution, of the amount of assets to be
transferred from each rabbi trust established to pay benefits under one or
more of the ATK Nonqualified Plans (each, an "ATK Rabbi Trust") to a rabbi
trust established or maintained by Sporting (each, a "Sporting Rabbi Trust")
as designated by Sporting with respect to the Sporting Nonqualified Plans
(each, a "Nonqualified Plan Transfer Amount"), which transfer shall be
effected as soon as practicable after the Distribution Date (but in no event
later than 30 days after the determination of the applicable Nonqualified Plan
Transfer Amount by ATK's actuary) (the date of such transfer, a "Nonqualified
Plan Transfer Date"). Each Nonqualified Plan Transfer Amount shall be
determined by such actuary and shall mean the portion of the assets of the
applicable ATK Rabbi Trust that bears the same ratio to the total assets of
such ATK Rabbi Trust, in each case, as of the Distribution Date, as the ratio
of the actuarial present value of the aggregate benefits accrued or earned
(whether or not vested) as of the Distribution Date by Sporting Employees,
Sporting Former Employees and their respective beneficiaries under the ATK
Nonqualified Plans with respect to which such ATK Rabbi Trust is maintained to
the actuarial present value of the total benefits earned or accrued (whether
or not vested) as of the Distribution Date with respect to all participants
under such plans; provided, however, that each such Nonqualified Plan Transfer
Amount shall be adjusted, as determined by ATK's actuary, to take into account
the actual investment return on the assets of the applicable ATK Rabbi Trust
from and including the end of the month in which the Distribution occurs, up
to, but not including, the applicable Nonqualified Plan Transfer Date, and
shall be decreased by any benefit payment made to a Continuing Sporting
Employee, Sporting Former Employee or their respective beneficiaries from the
applicable ATK Rabbi Trust during such period. As part of the determination
and transfer of any applicable Nonqualified Plan Transfer Amount, ATK and
Sporting shall cooperate in good faith to appropriately allocate and transfer
any non-marketable assets held in the applicable ATK Rabbi Trust

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(including any corporate-owned life insurance policies) to the appropriate
Sporting Rabbi Trust.

  


 

  

(iii) Sporting or the applicable Sporting Subsidiary shall, to the extent
applicable, cause the corresponding Sporting Nonqualified Plan to (A) credit
and recognize the compensation paid by ATK and its Affiliates (including, for
these purposes, Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries) to such participant to
the extent recognized under the corresponding ATK Nonqualified Plan for all
applicable purposes under such Sporting Nonqualified Plan as though it were
compensation from Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries, (B) assume and honor
the terms of all arrangements relating to beneficiaries and alternate payees
in effect and honored under the corresponding ATK Nonqualified Plan, (C)
credit each such participant's account with (1) the amount deferred by such
individual into the corresponding ATK Nonqualified Plan as of the Distribution
Date, plus (2) any employer contributions, whether vested or unvested, deemed
to have been made in relation to the amount described in clause (C)(1),
including, in each case, any earnings thereon, (D) recognize and honor all
deferral and distribution elections made by such individual (including any
deferral election applicable to any bonus earned but not yet paid as of the
Distribution Date) and (E) recognize and credit each participant for their
pre-Distribution service with ATK and its predecessors and Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Sporting and the Sporting
Subsidiaries).

  


 

  

(iv) No Distributions on Separation. Sporting and ATK acknowledge that neither
the Distribution nor any of the other Transactions will trigger a payment or
distribution of compensation under any Employee Benefit Plan that is a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan for any Sporting Employee, ATK
Employee, Sporting Former Employee or ATK Former Employee and, consequently,
that the payment or distribution of any compensation to which any Sporting
Employee, ATK Employee, Sporting Former Employee or ATK Former Employee is
entitled under any such Employee Benefit Plan will occur upon such
individual's separation from service from Sporting, ATK or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, or at such other time as specified in
the applicable Employee Benefit Plan (which may include a Transition Period
Employment Transfer).

  


 

  

(v) Code Section 409A. Sporting and ATK shall cooperate in good faith so that
the Distribution will not result in adverse Tax consequences under Code
Section 409A to any Sporting Employee, ATK Employee, Sporting Former Employee
or ATK Former Employee, or their respective beneficiaries, in respect of their
benefits under any Post-Distribution Sporting Benefit Plan or ATK Benefit
Plan.

  


 

  

(i) Post-Employment Welfare Benefits.

  


 

  

(i) Effective on or prior to the Distribution Date, Sporting shall maintain,
or cause its Subsidiaries to maintain, one or more post-employment

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

welfare benefit plans (each such plan, a "Sporting Post-Employment Welfare
Plan") for the benefit of each Continuing Sporting Employee and Sporting
Former Employee (or any eligible dependent or other covered beneficiary
thereof) who, immediately prior to the Distribution Date, participates in or
has accrued benefits under the post-employment welfare benefit plans
maintained by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary (such plans, the "ATK Post-Employment
Welfare Plans"). Each Sporting Post-Employment Welfare Plan shall have terms
and features that are substantially identical to the applicable ATK Post-
Employment Welfare Plan such that (for the avoidance of doubt), each ATK Post-
Employment Welfare Plan is substantially replicated by a corresponding
Sporting Post-Employment Welfare Plan. Effective as of the Distribution Date,
(x) the Sporting Post-Employment Welfare Plans shall assume and be responsible
for all Liabilities that are accrued as of the Distribution Date under the ATK
Post-Employment Welfare Plans with respect to Continuing Sporting Employees
and Sporting Former Employees (or any eligible dependent or other covered
beneficiary thereof) and (y) the ATK Post-Employment Welfare Plans shall
remain solely and exclusively responsible for all Liabilities with respect to,
or in any way related to, the ATK Employees and ATK Former Employees (or any
eligible dependent or other covered beneficiary thereof), whether accrued
before, on or after the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

(ii) All assets held in the ATK VEBA as of the Distribution Date, whether
attributable to the contributions of ATK, any ATK Subsidiary, Sporting or any
Sporting Subsidiary and the earnings thereon shall be retained in the ATK
VEBA. For the avoidance of doubt, on and after the Distribution Date, there
shall be no transfer of assets from the ATK VEBA to any corresponding
voluntary employees' beneficiary association under Code Section 501(c)(9)
established by Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary (or from ATK or any ATK
Subsidiary to Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary) and neither Sporting nor
any Sporting Subsidiary shall be required to make any contribution to the ATK
VEBA.

  


 

  

(j) Allocation of Employment and Employee Benefits-Related Liabilities.

  


 

  

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.07 or in Section 8.27 or as
required under applicable Law, (A) effective as of the Distribution Date,
Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries shall assume or retain, as the case may
be, all Liability and responsibility for all employment and employee benefits-
related Liabilities incurred, or arising out of a period ending, prior to or
on the Distribution Date that relate to the operation or conduct of the
Sporting Business or the employment by ATK or the ATK Subsidiaries of any
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee and (B) ATK and the ATK
Subsidiaries shall assume or retain, as the case may be, all Liability and
responsibility for all employment and employee benefits-related Liabilities
relating to the operation or conduct of the ATK Business whether incurred, or
arising out of a period ending, prior to, on or after the Distribution Date or
the employment by ATK or the ATK Subsidiaries of any ATK Employee or ATK
Former Employee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.07 or in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 8.27 or as required under applicable Law, from and after the
Distribution Date, Sporting and the Sporting Subsidiaries shall be liable for
all employment and employee benefits-related Liabilities incurred, or arising
out of a period ending, after the Distribution Date that relate to the
operation or conduct of the Sporting Business, the employment by Sporting or
the Sporting Subsidiaries of any Continuing Sporting Employee or any Post-
Distribution Sporting Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

(ii) The parties intend that Sporting Employees shall have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions, and that for purposes of any severance or
termination benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of ATK,
Sporting or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the
Transactions shall not constitute a severance of employment of any ATK
Employee or Sporting Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in Section 8.07(j)(i)
to the contrary, in the event that any such severance of employment results
solely from the consummation of the Transactions, each of ATK and Sporting
shall bear, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the party that is required
to pay any severance or unemployment compensation to the applicable ATK
Employee or Sporting Employee against, half of any Liabilities in respect of
such severance and unemployment compensation actually paid by such party.

  


 

  

(k) Employment Tax Reporting Responsibility. Sporting and ATK hereby agree to
follow the alternate procedure for United States employment tax withholding as
provided in Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320. Accordingly,
ATK shall have no United States employment tax reporting responsibilities, and
Sporting shall have full United States employment tax reporting
responsibilities, for Sporting Employees subject to United States employment
taxes following the Distribution Date.

  


 

  

(l) Administration. Following the date hereof, the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 8.07, including exchanging
information and data relating to workers' compensation, employee benefits and
employee benefit plan coverages (except to the extent prohibited by applicable
Law) and obtaining any Governmental Approvals required hereunder.

  


 

  

(m) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 8.07 and
Section 8.08 below are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this
Section 8.07 and Section 8.08 below) under or by reason of any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.07 or Section 8.08 below shall
amend, or be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination of), any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Employee Benefit Plan or any compensation or benefit plan of ATK, Sporting,
Orbital or any of their respective Affiliates.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.08. Post-Closing Terms and Conditions of Employment for ATK
Employees and Orbital Employees. During the Continuation Period, and subject
to the last sentence of this Section 8.08, ATK shall, or shall cause the
applicable ATK Subsidiary, including Orbital and its Subsidiaries, to provide
each employee of ATK or any of its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, employees of Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively,
"Continuing Employees") compensation and employee benefits in a manner that
neither favors nor disfavors such individual, in whole or in part, on the
basis of whether such individual was an employee of ATK or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries on the
other hand, immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
this Section 8.08 shall be deemed satisfied in the event ATK should for the
Continuation Period, either (i) provide compensation and employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and
employee benefits to which the Continuing Employees were entitled immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide compensation and employee benefits
to the Continuing Employees employed by ATK or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Orbital and its
Subsidiaries) at the same level as applies to similarly-situated individuals
employed by Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) provide compensation
and employee benefits to the Continuing Employees employed by Orbital or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time at the same level
as applies to similarly-situated individuals employed by ATK or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Orbital and its Subsidiaries). Nothing herein shall
limit the right of ATK or the employing ATK Subsidiary (including Orbital and
its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at
any time or require ATK or the employing ATK Subsidiary (including Orbital and
its Subsidiaries) to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary
or hourly wages, or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any
such termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, all terms and conditions of employment with respect to any
individual who is subject to a CBA shall be made in accordance with the terms
of such CBA.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.09. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification; Liability Insurance.
(a) ATK shall, for a period of at least six years after the Effective Time,
indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past
and present directors or officers of ATK, Orbital and their respective
Subsidiaries, and each individual who prior to the Effective Time becomes a
director or officer of Orbital, ATK or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
to the maximum extent that ATK, Orbital or such Subsidiary would, as
applicable, have been allowed to do so under applicable Law, in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with any of the Transaction
Documents or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(b) ATK shall maintain in effect for each past or present director or officer
of ATK, Orbital or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as well as each
individual who prior to the Effective Time becomes a director or officer of
ATK, Orbital or any of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

their respective Subsidiaries, for a period of at least six years after the
Effective Time, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance of at
least the same coverage and containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, as the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by ATK or Orbital, as
applicable, with respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with any of the Transaction Documents or the
Transactions; provided, however, that with respect to past or present
directors and officers of Orbital and its Subsidiaries (as well as any
individuals who prior to the Effective Time became a director or officer of
Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries), in no event shall ATK be required to pay
aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 8.09(b) in excess of 250%
of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by Orbital in 2013 on an
annualized basis for such purchase as set forth in forth in Section 8.09(b) of
the Orbital Disclosure Letter; provided that ATK shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.10. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any
Transaction Document (including pursuant to Section 1.03(a)(ix) hereof), all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses. This Section 8.10 does not
relate to Transfer Taxes, which are the subject of Sections 3.01 and 4.02 of
the Tax Matters Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.11. Public Announcements. ATK, Sporting and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Orbital, on the other hand, shall consult with each other and shall
mutually agree upon any press release or other public statements with respect
to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation and agreement, other than any
press release or other public statement that only contains information and
statements that have been previously approved by the parties pursuant to this
Section 8.11, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any U.S. national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the other parties before issuing any
such press release or making any such public announcement. The parties hereto
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.12. Stock Exchange Listings. (a) ATK shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of ATK Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to
be approved for quotation on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance
with respect to the NYSE prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(b) Sporting shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Sporting
Common Stock to be distributed in the Distribution to be approved for
quotation on the NYSE or NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance with
respect to the NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 8.13. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, ATK, Sporting,
Merger Sub and Orbital shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any acquisitions or dispositions of ATK Common Stock, Sporting Common Stock or
Orbital Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect thereto),
in each case resulting from the Transactions, by each individual who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to ATK, Sporting or
Orbital, as applicable, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.14. Covenants of Orbital Regarding Non-Solicitation. (a) Orbital
agrees that from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 8.14, Orbital shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives to, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) the submission of any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Orbital Acquisition Proposal,
(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-public
information in connection with, or for the purpose of, encouraging or
facilitating an Orbital Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement constituting an Orbital
Acquisition Proposal. Orbital shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to an Orbital Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Orbital Acquisition
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any Person in connection with a potential
Orbital Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.14(a) by any
Representative of Orbital or its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of
this Section 8.14(a) by Orbital.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.14(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining
the Orbital Stockholder Approval, Orbital or any of its Representatives
receives an Orbital Acquisition Proposal, which Orbital Acquisition Proposal
did not result from any breach of this Section 8.14, and the Board of
Directors of Orbital or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Orbital Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an
Orbital Superior Proposal, then Orbital and its Representatives may (x) enter
into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of
Persons making the Orbital Acquisition Proposal and furnish pursuant to such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement information (including non-public
information) with respect to Orbital and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Orbital Acquisition Proposal; provided that
Orbital shall promptly provide to ATK any material non-public information
concerning Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any Person given such access which was not previously provided to ATK or its
Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Orbital
Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) Orbital shall promptly notify ATK in the event that Orbital or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives receives an Orbital
Acquisition Proposal and, subject to applicable Law (including with respect to
fiduciary duties), shall disclose to ATK the material terms and conditions of
any such Orbital Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making such Orbital Acquisition Proposal, and Orbital shall, upon
the request of ATK, keep ATK reasonably informed of any material developments
with respect to any such Orbital Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes thereto). Orbital shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person that
prohibits Orbital from providing to ATK any of the information required to be
provided to ATK under this Section 8.14 within the time periods contemplated
hereby.

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of Orbital nor any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to ATK), or
publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
ATK), the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Orbital to the holders
of Orbital Common Stock that they give the Orbital Stockholder Approval or (B)
recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly
propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Orbital Acquisition Proposal (it
being understood that the Board of Directors of Orbital or any committee
thereof may make or cause Orbital to make a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication and may elect to take no position with respect to an Orbital
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of such Orbital Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse
modification) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an
"Orbital Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) execute or enter into (or
cause or permit Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into)
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
constituting an Orbital Acquisition Proposal, other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time Orbital
Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board of Directors of
Orbital or any committee thereof may make an Orbital Adverse Recommendation
Change if (x) the Board of Directors of Orbital or any committee thereof has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) in the case of an Orbital
Adverse Recommendation Change made in response to an Orbital Acquisition
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Orbital or any committee thereof has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Orbital Acquisition Proposal constitutes an
Orbital Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of
Orbital or any committee thereof shall not, and shall cause Orbital not to,
make an Orbital Adverse Recommendation Change

in connection with an Orbital Superior Proposal unless (1) Orbital has given
ATK at least five Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take
such action (which notice shall specify the identity of the party making such
Orbital Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and shall attach the
agreement and all material related documentation providing for such Orbital
Superior Proposal), (2) Orbital has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with ATK during such notice
period, to the extent ATK wishes to negotiate, to enable ATK to propose in
writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents such that it would cause such Orbital Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute an Orbital Superior Proposal, (3) following
the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Orbital or any
committee thereof shall have considered in good faith any such binding offer
from ATK, and shall have determined that the Orbital Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute an Orbital Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
in such binding offer were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any
material change to the material terms of such Orbital Superior Proposal,
Orbital shall, in each case, have delivered to ATK an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the notice period shall
have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least three
Business Days (rather than the five Business Days otherwise contemplated by
clause (1) above). Nothing in this Section 8.14(d) shall be deemed to modify
or otherwise affect the obligation of Orbital to call the Orbital
Stockholders' Meeting and to submit this Agreement and the Merger to Orbital
stockholders.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 8.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
Orbital or the Board of Directors of Orbital or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Orbital a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
Orbital that is required by applicable Law.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.15. Covenants of ATK Regarding Non-Solicitation. (a) ATK agrees that
from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, except as expressly permitted
by this Section 8.15, ATK shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to, (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries regarding,
or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, an ATK Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other Person any non-public information in connection with, or
for the purpose of, encouraging or facilitating an ATK Acquisition Proposal or
(C) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
constituting an ATK Acquisition Proposal. ATK shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an ATK Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

be expected to lead to an ATK Acquisition Proposal, request the prompt return
or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any
Person in connection with a potential Orbital Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 8.15(a) by any Representative of ATK or its Subsidiaries shall
constitute a breach of this Section 8.15(a) by ATK.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.15(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining
the ATK Stockholder Approval, ATK or any of its Representatives receives an
ATK Acquisition Proposal, which ATK Acquisition Proposal did not result from
any breach of this Section 8.15, and the Board of Directors of ATK or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such ATK Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an ATK Superior
Proposal, then ATK and its Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the ATK
Acquisition Proposal and furnish pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement information (including non-public information) with respect to ATK
and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such ATK
Acquisition Proposal; provided that ATK shall promptly provide to Orbital any
material non-public information concerning the ATK Business that is provided
to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to Orbital
or its Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
ATK Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) ATK shall promptly notify Orbital in the event that ATK or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives receives an ATK
Acquisition Proposal and, subject to applicable Law (including with respect to
fiduciary duties), shall disclose to Orbital the material terms and conditions
of any such ATK Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making such ATK Acquisition Proposal, and ATK shall, upon the
request of Orbital, keep Orbital reasonably informed of any material
developments with respect to any such ATK Acquisition Proposal (including any
material changes thereto). ATK shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person that
prohibits ATK from providing to Orbital any of the information required to be
provided to Orbital under this Section 8.15 within the time periods
contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of ATK nor any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Orbital), or
publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Orbital), the recommendation by the Board of Directors of ATK to the holders
of ATK Common Stock that they give the ATK Stockholder Approval or (B)
recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly
propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any ATK Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that the Board of Directors of ATK or any committee thereof may
make or cause ATK to make a customary "stop, look and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

listen" communication and may elect to take no position with respect to an ATK
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of such ATK Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse
modification) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an
"ATK Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) execute or enter into (or cause
or permit ATK or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into) any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement constituting an
ATK Acquisition Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the time ATK Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not
after, the Board of Directors of ATK or any committee thereof may make an ATK
Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) the Board of Directors of ATK or any
committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y)
in the case of an ATK Adverse Recommendation Change made in response to an ATK
Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of ATK or any committee thereof
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such ATK Acquisition Proposal constitutes an
ATK Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of ATK
or any committee thereof shall not, and shall cause ATK not to, make an ATK
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with an ATK Superior Proposal
unless (1) ATK has given Orbital at least five Business Days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the
identity of the party making such ATK Superior Proposal and the material terms
thereof and shall attach the agreement and all material related documentation
providing for such ATK Superior Proposal), (2) ATK has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Orbital during
such notice period, to the extent Orbital wishes to negotiate, to enable
Orbital to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents such that it would cause
such ATK Superior Proposal to no longer constitute an ATK Superior Proposal,
(3) following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of ATK or
any committee thereof shall have considered in good faith any such binding
offer from Orbital, and shall have determined that the ATK Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute an ATK Superior Proposal if the revisions
proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect and (4) in the event of
any material change to the material terms of such ATK Superior Proposal, ATK
shall, in each case, have delivered to Orbital an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (1) above and the notice period shall have
recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least three Business
Days (rather than the five Business Days otherwise contemplated by clause (1)
above). Nothing in this Section 8.15(d) shall be deemed to modify or otherwise
affect the obligation of ATK to call the ATK Stockholders' Meeting and to
submit the issuance of shares of ATK Common Stock in the Merger to ATK
stockholders.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 8.15 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
ATK or the Board of Directors of ATK or any committee thereof from (i) taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of ATK a position contemplated by

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of ATK that
is required by applicable Law.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.16. Tax Matters. (a) For United States Federal income Tax purposes,
it is intended that (i) pursuant to Sections 351, 355, 361 and 368 of the
Code, no gain or loss be recognized to ATK or Sporting as a result of the
Sporting Transfers and the Distribution (other than any gain or loss from
intercompany transactions within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-13 taken into account upon the Distribution), (ii) pursuant to Section
355 of the Code, no gain or loss be recognized to (and no amount shall be
includible in the income of) the Eligible Holders (except with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional shares) as a result of the Distribution (the
treatment described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Intended
Distribution Tax Treatment"), (iii) the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
described in Section 368(a) of the Code and (iv) pursuant to Sections 354 and
361 of the Code, no gain or loss be recognized to Merger Sub or holders of
Orbital Common Stock (except with respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional shares) as a result of the Merger (the treatment described in
clauses (iii) and (iv), the "Intended Merger Tax Treatment" and, together with
the Intended Distribution Tax Treatment, the "Intended Tax Treatment").

  


 

  

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to cause the applicable Transactions to qualify for the Intended Tax
Treatment, including (i) refraining from any action that such party knows is
reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax Treatment, (ii) executing such
amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order for the
applicable Transactions to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment (it being
understood that no party will be required to agree to any such amendment that
it determines in good faith materially adversely affects the value of the
applicable Transactions to such party or its stockholders) and (iii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in
Section 9.02(e) and Section 9.03(e), including by executing and delivering to
counsel customary letters of representation.

  


 

  

(c) ATK and Orbital shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy
their obligations under Section 8.16(c) of the ATK Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.17. Replacement of Guarantees. Sporting shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, or cause a Sporting Subsidiary to provide, on
or prior to the Distribution Date, replacement Guarantees with respect each
Guarantee issued by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary for the benefit of Sporting or
any Sporting Subsidiary or with respect to any Sporting Liability or the
Sporting Business, in each case that is outstanding as of the Distribution
Date (collectively, the "Existing Sporting Guarantees"), in each case in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to ATK and the respective banks,
insurance companies or other counterparties. ATK and Sporting shall cooperate
to obtain any necessary release of the Existing Sporting Guarantees issued by
ATK or any ATK Subsidiary in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to ATK
and Sporting. In the event that all such replacement Guarantees and releases
of Existing Sporting Guarantees are not in place as of the Distribution Date,
Sporting shall, as soon

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

94  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

as practicable following the Closing, provide, or cause a Sporting Subsidiary
to provide, replacement Guarantees with respect to such Existing Sporting
Guarantees that were not replaced on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless ATK and its Subsidiaries against all
Liabilities arising under such Existing Sporting Guarantees. If Sporting is
unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required replacement
Guarantees and releases of Existing Sporting Guarantees on or prior to the
Distribution Date, Sporting will, as agent or subcontractor for the applicable
guarantor or obligor, pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or
other Liabilities of such guarantor or obligor thereunder, and Sporting will
not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, agree to renew or extend the term
of, or modify the terms to increase any obligations under, or transfer to a
third Person, any loan, guarantee, lease, Contract or other obligation for
which ATK or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable unless all
obligations of ATK or any of its Subsidiaries with respect thereto are
thereupon terminated by documentation satisfactory in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to ATK.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.18. Sole Stockholder Approval. Immediately following the execution
of this Agreement, ATK, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall execute
and deliver a written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with the
DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.19. Transaction Litigation. ATK shall give Orbital the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against ATK and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Orbital,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Orbital shall give ATK the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against Orbital and/or its directors
relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of ATK, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting in any way the
parties' obligations under Section 8.04, each of ATK and Orbital shall
cooperate, shall cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate, in each
case in the defense against such litigation. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept reasonably
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the litigation by the litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client
privilege between the litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the litigation but will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over the litigation except for the
settlement consent set forth above.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.20. Sporting Financing Matters. (a) Sporting and ATK shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, from one or more third party
financing sources, debt financing to be incurred by Sporting and/or the
Sporting Subsidiaries prior to, at the time of or immediately following the
Distribution generating aggregate net proceeds (together with cash on hand) of
not less than the Sporting Dividend Amount (the "New Sporting Debt Financing")
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Sporting Commitment Letter,
including using their respective reasonable best

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

95  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Sporting Commitment Letter until the
Transactions are consummated, (ii) timely negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the facilities contemplated by the Sporting Commitment Letter on
the terms and conditions set forth therein (or on terms that will not delay or
prevent the Closing or make the funding with respect to the New Sporting Debt
Financing less likely to occur), (iii) satisfy or cause to be waived on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Sporting and ATK set forth in the
Sporting Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements that are within their
control and otherwise comply with their obligations thereunder and (iv) upon
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, consummate the New Sporting
Debt Financing, including by enforcing any and all rights available to ATK and
Sporting to cause the New Sporting Debt Financing to be consummated, prior to,
at the time of or immediately following the Distribution. ATK shall keep
Orbital reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the New
Sporting Debt Financing and the process relating thereto.

  


 

  

(b) Neither ATK nor Sporting shall amend, modify or waive, or agree to amend,
modify or waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term of the
Sporting Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of Orbital if
such amendment, modification or waiver (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the
New Sporting Debt Financing (unless, in the case of this clause (x), such
amount is fully replaced with an amount of new financing with conditionality
no less favorable to Sporting in any material respect) or (y) amends the
conditions precedent to the New Sporting Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the
funding of the New Sporting Debt Financing less likely to occur (provided,
however, that Sporting and ATK may, without the consent of Orbital, amend or
modify the Sporting Commitment Letter (x) in accordance with the "market flex"
provisions thereof and (y) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or other titled roles with respect to financial
institutions that have not executed the Sporting Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ATK
shall give Orbital reasonably prompt notice (x) of any material breach or
material default by any party to the Sporting Commitment Letter or any of the
definitive agreements related to the New Sporting Debt Financing which could
reasonably be expected to result in ATK and Sporting not receiving financing
in an aggregate amount (together with cash on hand) at least equal to the
Sporting Dividend Amount under the Sporting Commitment Letter on or prior to
the Distribution Date, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any financing source with respect to any material
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Sporting
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the New Sporting Debt
Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Sporting Debt Financing or any
definitive agreement with respect thereto), and (z) if at any time for any
reason ATK believes in good faith that Sporting will not be able to obtain the
New Sporting Debt Financing in an aggregate amount (together with cash on
hand) at least equal to the Sporting Dividend Amount on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Sporting
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the New Sporting Debt
Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date Orbital delivers
ATK a written request, ATK shall provide information reasonably requested by
Orbital relating to the circumstances

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

96  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence;
provided that in no event will ATK or Sporting be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney−client privilege.

  


 

  

(c) If the New Sporting Debt Financing in an aggregate amount (together with
cash on hand) at least equal to the Sporting Dividend Amount becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sporting
Commitment Letter, and such unavailable amount is reasonably required to fund
the Sporting Dividend Amount, ATK and Sporting shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
(together with cash on hand) sufficient to fund the Sporting Dividend Amount
upon terms and conditions no less favorable (as determined in the good faith
judgment of ATK), taken as a whole, to Sporting than the terms and conditions
set forth in the Sporting Commitment Letter. ATK and Sporting shall as soon as
reasonably practicable deliver to Orbital true and complete copies of all
contracts (including any fee letters, which may be redacted as required by the
lenders thereto) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the New Sporting Debt Financing. In the
event ATK and/or Sporting obtain alternative financing, the term "New Sporting
Debt Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean such alternative
financing from and after the time such alternative financing is obtained.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.21. ATK and Orbital Financing Matters; Debt Financing Cooperation.
(a) Prior to the Closing, ATK shall either (i) commence and complete an offer
(the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding
6.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and, unless a
consent with respect to the Distribution has already been obtained, solicit
consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of the 2020 Notes to amend
the indenture governing the 2020 Notes to, among other things, modify or
eliminate substantially all of the negative covenants and events of default
set forth therein, on terms and conditions as may be determined by ATK
following consultation with Orbital and reasonable consideration of any input
provided by Orbital with respect thereto, or (ii) on or prior to the Closing,
issue a notice of redemption of all of the outstanding 2020 Notes and either
complete such redemption or irrevocably deposit with the trustee for the 2020
Notes funds in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on
the outstanding 2020 Notes on the redemption date, in each case in accordance
with the redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes.

  


 

  

(b) If ATK elects to launch the Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation as
described in Section 8.21(a)(i) but less than all of the outstanding 2020
Notes are tendered in the Tender Offer, then ATK shall, on or prior to the
Closing, issue a notice of redemption for all outstanding 2020 Notes and
either complete such redemption or irrevocably deposit with the trustee for
the 2020 Notes funds in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and
interest on the outstanding 2020 Notes on the redemption date, in each case in
accordance with the redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2020
Notes.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

97  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) On or prior to the Closing, ATK shall issue a notice of redemption of all
of the outstanding 2024 Notes and complete such redemption in accordance with
the redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. In the
event that, prior to the redemption date, any holders of the 2024 Notes elect
to exercise their conversion rights as set forth in the indenture governing
the 2024 Notes, ATK shall satisfy its obligations with respect to the
conversion of the 2024 Notes solely in cash.

  


 

  

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (y) the Closing, Orbital
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide to ATK all
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by ATK in connection with the
arrangement and consummation of the New ATK Debt Financing (provided that such
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Orbital and its Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
participate in a reasonable number of requested meetings (including customary
one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for,
and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the New ATK Debt Financing and
Orbital's senior management and Representatives), presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the New ATK Debt Financing, (ii) assist with the preparation
of (A) materials for rating agency presentations, (B) prospectuses, offering
memoranda and private placement memoranda (including use of reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
of the foregoing), (C) bank information memoranda (including a public-side
version thereof) and (D) similar documents, in each case required or customary
in connection with the New ATK Debt Financing, (iii) execute and deliver (or
use reasonable best efforts to obtain) customary certificates, accountant's
comfort letters (which shall provide "negative assurance" comfort), consents,
legal opinions, surveys and title insurance in each case as reasonably
requested by the lenders of the New ATK Debt Financing, (iv) provide customary
authorization letters to the financing sources authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing a customary representation
that such information does not contain a material misstatement or omission and
containing a representation to the financing sources that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information about Orbital or its Subsidiaries or their securities, (v) provide
lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders of, the New ATK Debt
Financing with all documentation and other information required with respect
to the Orbital and its Subsidiaries in connection with applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001),
(vi) assist ATK and its Representatives with the preparation of the documents
governing the New ATK Debt Financing (including any schedules, annexes or
exhibits thereto and any pro forma financial statements and financial
projections required to be delivered thereunder and such other pertinent and
customary financial and other information relating to the Orbital and its
Subsidiaries as ATK shall reasonably request in order to market, syndicate and
consummate the New ATK Debt Financing) and (vii) cooperate with ATK's
financing sources' due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable;
provided, however, all non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

98  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Orbital obtained by ATK pursuant to this Section 8.21(d) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, and Orbital
shall only be required to furnish such information to any prospective lenders
or other proposed financing sources, underwriters, placement agents, initial
purchasers or other third parties who have agreed to keep such information
confidential; and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall
require any cooperation to the extent it would (1) require Orbital, its
Subsidiaries or the Board of Directors of Orbital or its Subsidiaries to waive
or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment, financing
or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing Date; (2) require
any officer of Orbital or its Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any document
or certificate in connection with the New ATK Debt Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
(other than customary documents or certificates solely relating to Orbital or
its Subsidiaries including the authorization letter and representation
referred to in Section 8.21(d)(iv)); (3) unreasonably or materially interfere
with the ongoing business or operations of Orbital and its Subsidiaries; (4)
require Orbital or its Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict
with or violate any applicable Laws or any provisions of the organizational
documents of Orbital or its Subsidiaries, or that would result in a violation
or breach of, or default under, any Orbital Material Contract in effect as of
the date of any such request or (5) result in any officer or director of
Orbital or its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability in connection
with the New ATK Debt Financing. Orbital hereby consents to the customary use
of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service marks and logos in connection
with the New ATK Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of Orbital or
any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no obligation of Orbital or its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Closing and
Orbital and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any action under
any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than, in each
case, customary documents or certificates solely relating to Orbital or its
Subsidiaries including the authorization letter and management representation
referred to in Section 8.21(d)(iv)). ATK shall indemnify and hold harmless
Orbital, Orbital's Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the New ATK Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to (1) any information provided by Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries
and (2) any customary costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred
by Orbital or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of
Orbital and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 8.21(d); provided
that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any indemnified party, apply to
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses to the extent they are found in a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from fraud, intentional or willful misrepresentation, gross
negligence, willful misconduct or willful concealment of such indemnified
party.

  


 

  

(e) Orbital shall arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

99  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

discharge and termination on the Closing Date of the Existing Orbital
Facility, all Indebtedness then outstanding under the Existing Orbital
Facility and all guarantees and security interests granted by Orbital or any
of its Subsidiaries under the Existing Orbital Facility.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.22. ATK Charter; Governance Matters. (a) The certificate of
incorporation of ATK shall be amended and restated at or immediately following
the Effective Time to change ATK's name to "Orbital ATK, Inc." (the "ATK
Charter Amendment") and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation
shall be the certificate of incorporation of ATK until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The parties acknowledge and
agree that under the DGCL as in effect as of the date of the Agreement,
implementing the ATK Charter Amendment would require either (1) the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ATK
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at a duly called meeting of stockholders
or (2) ATK to merge with a wholly-owned Subsidiary, with ATK surviving the
merger and amending its certificate of incorporation in connection therewith
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. In the event the legislation
submitted to the Corporate Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association
proposing to amend the DGCL to eliminate the requirement under Section 242 of
the DGCL that a corporation's stockholders approve any amendment to the
corporation's certificate of incorporation to change its name has not been
adopted or is not effective prior to the date on which the definitive Joint
Proxy Statement is ready to be mailed to ATK's stockholders, then ATK shall
determine, in consultation with Orbital, whether to (x) submit the ATK Charter
Amendment to ATK's stockholders for approval at the ATK Stockholder Meeting or
(y) implement the ATK Charter Amendment through a merger under Section 253 of
the DGCL as contemplated by the immediately prior sentence (it being
understood that in no event shall any such ATK Charter Amendment be effective
prior to the Effective Time).

  


 

  

(b) Each of ATK, Merger Sub and Orbital shall take all actions necessary to
cause the matters set forth on Exhibit C hereto to occur on the Closing Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.23. Non-Solicitation of Employees. (a) For a period of 18 months
following the Distribution, unless otherwise agreed in writing between
Sporting and ATK (including pursuant to any Transition Period Employment
Transfer under Section 1.10), Sporting shall not, and shall cause the Sporting
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly solicit, recruit or hire any
employee of ATK or any ATK Subsidiary at the director level or above;
provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a general solicitation to
the public of general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by search
firms not specifically directed at such ATK Employees (so long as neither
Sporting nor any of the Sporting Subsidiaries hires any such ATK Employee in
violation of this Section 8.23(a)) or (ii) Sporting or any of the Sporting
Subsidiaries from soliciting, recruiting or hiring any ATK Employee who has
ceased to be employed or retained by ATK or any ATK Subsidiary for at least
twelve months.

  


 

  

(b) For a period of 18 months following the Distribution, unless otherwise
agreed in writing between ATK and Sporting, ATK shall not, and shall cause

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

100  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the ATK Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly solicit, recruit or hire
any employee of Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary at the director level or
above; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a general
solicitation to the public of general advertising or similar methods of
solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at such Sporting
Employees (so long as neither ATK nor any ATK Subsidiary hires any such
Sporting Employee in violation of this Section 8.23(b)) or (ii) ATK or any ATK
Subsidiary from soliciting, recruiting or hiring any such Sporting Employee
who has ceased to be employed or retained by Sporting or any Sporting
Subsidiary for at least twelve months.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.24. Covenant Not To Compete. (a) In furtherance of the Merger and
the Transactions, ATK covenants and agrees that, for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, neither
ATK nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of
Sporting, engage, directly or indirectly, in the business of developing,
manufacturing, sourcing or supplying firearms, tactical gear, sporting
accessories, shooting accessories, recreational accessories, outdoor products
or small-caliber ammunition, whether directly to or to wholesale customers for
resale to, the local or federal law enforcement, U.S. Government (including
the U.S. Department of Defense), foreign government or consumer markets (such
activities collectively being the "Restricted Business"); provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the manufacture or sale of small-caliber
ammunition manufactured at the Lake City plant by ATK or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Ammunition Products (as such term is defined in the
Supply Agreement)), which will be governed by the terms of the Supply
Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) In furtherance of the Merger and the Transactions, Sporting covenants and
agrees that, for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Sporting nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of ATK, engage, directly
or indirectly, in any business conducted by ATK or any of its Subsidiaries as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date other than the Restricted Business
(it being understood that with respect to Ammunition Products, Sporting shall
be subject to the applicable terms set forth in the Supply Agreement (for so
long as such agreement is in effect)). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.24(b) shall prohibit
Sporting or any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in the businesses conducted
by Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary on the Closing Date.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.25. ATK Business Financial Statements. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than May
31, 2014, ATK will provide Orbital with the unaudited balance sheet of the ATK
Business at March 31, 2014, and the related unaudited statements of income for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 (collectively, the "2014 Annual ATK
Business Financial Statements").

  


 

  

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, ATK shall prepare and furnish to
Orbital, as promptly as practicable after the end of the applicable fiscal
quarter, but in no event later than the date that is fifty (50) days after the
end of the applicable fiscal quarter, copies of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the unaudited interim balance sheet of the ATK Business at the last day of the
quarter then ended, together with the related unaudited interim statements of
income for such period (collectively, the "2015 Interim ATK Business Financial
Statements" and, together with the 2014 Annual ATK Business Financial
Statements, the "New ATK Business Financial Statements").

  


 

  

SECTION 8.26. Intellectual Property Licenses.

  


 

  

(a) Unregistered Intellectual Property License. ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries
hereby grant to Sporting (with the right to sublicense only to Sporting's
Subsidiaries with the scope of any sublicense to such Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries to be limited to only those rights required to operate business
in the manner conducted by such Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as of the
Distribution Date) a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, paid-up and non-
exclusive license to use or sell goods using Unregistered Intellectual
Property that originated in and is owned by ATK or an ATK Subsidiary and which

prior to the Distribution Date. Sporting hereby grants to ATK and ATK
Subsidiaries a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, paid-up and non-exclusive
license (with no right to sublicense) to use or sell goods using Unregistered
Intellectual Property that originated in and is owned by Sporting or a
Sporting Subsidiary and which was regularly used in the ordinary course of
business by ATK or an ATK Subsidiary prior to the Distribution Date.

  

  

(b) Springing Powder Formula License. If the Canister Powder Products (as
defined in the term sheet for the Supply Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit
F) component of the Supply Agreement is properly terminated by Sporting
because of a material breach by ATK (an "ATK Default Termination"), or if the
Supply Agreement is in effect and ATK gives notice to Sporting, pursuant to
the terms of the Supply Agreement, of its intent to not renew the Canister
Powder Products component of the Supply Agreement (such notice, a "Non-Renewal
Notice"):

  


 

  

(i) Effective: (x) immediately after an ATK Default Termination or (y) thirty
(30) days after Sporting's receipt of a Non-Renewal Notice, ATK and the ATK
Subsidiaries hereby grant to Sporting (with (A) a right to sublicense to the
Sporting Subsidiaries and (B) a right to sublicense to third parties to the
extent necessary to make or have made canister reloading powders for the
benefit of Sporting) a worldwide, perpetual, royalty free, paid-up and non-
exclusive license to use, sell, offer for sale, make, have made and export
only consumer reloading canisters containing reloading powder embodying the
Powder Formula to commercial consumers in standard consumer canisters; and

  


 

  

(ii) No later than ninety (90) days after either such ATK Default Termination
or Sporting's receipt of a Non-Renewal Notice, ATK and the ATK Subsidiaries
shall deliver to Sporting all formulas, designs, plans, specifications, data
and other information describing or embodying the Powder Formula such that
Sporting may fully enjoy the license set forth in Section 8.26(b)(i) above.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

102  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 8.27. Adjustments to ATK Equity Awards Relating to the Distribution.
(a) Prior to the Distribution Date, the Board of Directors of ATK (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the ATK Stock Plans) and the Board of
Directors of Sporting shall adopt resolutions or take such other actions as
may be required to effect the following:

  


 

  

(i) ATK Options. Each outstanding option to acquire ATK Common Stock granted
under the ATK Stock Plans (each, an "ATK Option"), whether vested or unvested,
shall be converted as of the time of the Distribution into both an adjusted
ATK Option (each, an "Adjusted ATK Option") and an option issued by Sporting
to acquire Sporting Common Stock (each, a "Sporting Option") and shall, except
as otherwise provided in this Section 8.27, be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including with respect to vesting) after the Distribution Date as
applicable to such ATK Option immediately prior to the Distribution Date;
provided, however, that from and after the Distribution Date:

  


 

  

(A) the number of shares of ATK Common Stock subject to such Adjusted ATK
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of ATK Common Stock subject to
the related ATK Option immediately prior to the Distribution Date;

  


 

  

(B) the number of shares of Sporting Common Stock subject to such Sporting
Option, rounded down to the nearest whole share, shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of ATK Common Stock subject
to the related ATK Option immediately prior to the Distribution Date by (2)
the Distribution Ratio;

  


 

  

(C) the per share exercise price of such Adjusted ATK Option, rounded up to
the nearest hundredth of a cent, shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (1) the per share exercise price of the related ATK Option
immediately prior to the Distribution Date by (2) the ATK Ratio; and

  


 

  

(D) the per share exercise price of such Sporting Option, rounded up to the
nearest hundredth of a cent, shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (1) the per share exercise price of the related ATK Option
immediately prior to the Distribution Date by (2) the Sporting Ratio;

  


 

  

provided, further, however, that the exercise price, the number of shares of
ATK Common Stock and the number of shares of Sporting Common Stock subject to
such options, and the terms and conditions of exercise of such options shall
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Section
409A and, regardless of whether the ATK Options are "incentive stock options"
(as defined in Code Section 422) in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Code Section 424(a).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

103  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(ii) ATK Restricted Shares. Each holder of an outstanding share of ATK Common
Stock subject to restrictions granted under the ATK Stock Plans (the "ATK
Restricted Shares") immediately prior to the Distribution shall receive from
Sporting, as of the time of the Distribution, a number of shares of Sporting
Common Stock (the "Sporting Restricted Shares") determined in the same manner
as for other holders of ATK Common Stock based on the Distribution Ratio,
which Sporting Restricted Shares shall have the terms specified in this
Section 8.27(a)(ii). Sporting shall cause the Agent to distribute the Sporting
Restricted Shares, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, to such holders
of ATK Restricted Shares in accordance with and pursuant to Sections 2.02(b)
and 2.02(c), respectively.

  


 

  

(A) Restricted Shares held by Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting
Former Employees.

  


 

  

(1) Sporting Restricted Shares. Sporting Restricted Shares issued to
Continuing Sporting Employees and Sporting Former Employees pursuant to this
Section 8.27(a)(ii) shall be subject to the same vesting requirements and
dates and other terms and conditions as the ATK Restricted Shares to which
they relate (including the right to receive dividends or other distributions
paid on Sporting Common Stock).

  


 

  

(2) ATK Restricted Shares. Each ATK Restricted Share held by a Continuing
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee immediately following the
Distribution shall continue to relate to the same number of shares of ATK
Common Stock and (x) each such ATK Restricted Share that was granted to such
Continuing Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee more than one year
prior to the Distribution (each, a "Vested Adjusted ATK Restricted Share")
shall vest and be free of restrictions immediately following the Distribution
and (y) each ATK Restricted Share granted to such Continuing Sporting Employee
or Sporting Former Employee that is not a Vested Adjusted ATK Restricted Share
(each, a "Cliff-Adjusted ATK Restricted Share") shall vest and be free of
restrictions on the first anniversary of its date of grant, subject to the
holder's continued employment or service on the same basis as prior to the
Distribution (except as provided in this Section 8.27). Other than as provided
in the immediately preceding sentence, each such Vested Adjusted ATK
Restricted Share and each such Cliff-Adjusted ATK Restricted Share shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such Vested Adjusted ATK Restricted Share and such Cliff-Adjusted ATK
Restricted Share immediately prior to the Distribution, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to forfeiture or accelerated

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

104  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

vesting thereof in connection with a termination of the holder's employment or
service, as applicable.

  


 

  

(B) Restricted Shares held by ATK Employees and ATK Former Employees.

  


 

  

(1) ATK Restricted Shares. Each ATK Restricted Share held by an ATK Employee
or ATK Former Employee immediately following the Distribution (each, an
"Adjusted ATK Restricted Share") shall continue to relate to the same number
of shares of ATK Common Stock and to be subject to the same vesting
requirements and dates and other terms and conditions as were applicable to
such Adjusted ATK Restricted Share immediately prior to the Distribution.

  


 

  

(2) Sporting Restricted Shares. (i) Each Sporting Restricted Share issued
pursuant to this Section 8.27(a)(ii) to an ATK Employee or ATK Former Employee
and relating to an ATK Restricted Share that was granted more than one year
prior to the Distribution Date (each, a "Vested Sporting Restricted Share")
shall vest and be free of restrictions immediately following the Distribution
and (ii) each Sporting Restricted Share issued pursuant to this Section 8.27
(a)(ii) to an ATK Employee or ATK Former Employee that is not a Vested
Sporting Restricted Share (each, a "Cliff-Adjusted Sporting Restricted Share")
shall vest and be free of restrictions on the first anniversary of the date of
grant of the ATK Restricted Share to which it relates, subject to the holder's
continued employment or service on the same basis as prior to the Distribution
(except as provided in this Section 8.27). Other than as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, each such Vested Sporting Restricted Share and
each such Cliff-Adjusted Sporting Restricted Share shall otherwise be subject
to the same terms and conditions as the ATK Restricted Shares to which they
relate, including the right to receive dividends or other distributions paid
on Sporting Common Stock and, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
forfeiture or accelerated vesting thereof in connection with a termination of
the holder's employment or service, as applicable.

  


 

  

(iii) ATK Performance Share Units. Each performance share unit with respect to
ATK Common Stock granted under the ATK Stock Plans that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Distribution (each, an "ATK PSU") shall be treated as
provided below:

  


 

  

(A) Specified PSU Holders. Each holder of an ATK PSU who is, immediately prior
to the Distribution (or was, at the time of such holder's termination),
employed as a Corporate Senior Vice President or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

105  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

in a more senior position (each, a "Specified PSU Holder") shall receive from
Sporting, as of the time of the Distribution, a restricted share unit with
respect to Sporting Common Stock (each, a "Sporting RSU") covering such number
of shares of Sporting Common Stock as determined by applying the Distribution
Ratio in the same way as if such outstanding ATK PSU were comprised of fully
vested shares of ATK Common Stock (with the number of such fully vested shares
of ATK Common Stock to be determined based on the applicable PSU Performance
Level) as of the Distribution Date. In addition, from and after the
Distribution Date, each such ATK PSU (each, an "Adjusted ATK RSU") shall be
adjusted so that it covers a number of shares of ATK Common Stock determined
by the applicable PSU Performance Level, and, except as set forth in Section
8.27 of the ATK Disclosure Letter, shall otherwise continue to be subject to
the same vesting requirements and dates and other terms and conditions as the
ATK PSU to which it relates, provided that the vesting criteria applicable to
such Adjusted ATK RSU shall provide for solely service-based vesting.

  


 

  

(B) Other PSU Holders.

  


 

  

(1) FY13-15 ATK PSUs. Each holder of an ATK PSU who is not a Specified PSU
Holder (each, an "Other PSU Holder") shall, with respect to each ATK PSU
granted to such Other PSU Holder the vesting of which is dependent, in part,
on achievement of performance goals in respect of ATK's 2013, 2014 and 2015
fiscal years (each such ATK PSU, an "FY13-15 ATK PSU"), receive from Sporting,
as of the time of the Distribution, a Sporting RSU with respect to such number
of shares of Sporting Common Stock as determined by applying the Distribution
Ratio in the same way as if such FY13-15 ATK PSU were comprised of fully
vested shares of ATK Common Stock (with the number of fully vested shares of
ATK Common Stock to be determined based on the applicable PSU Performance
Level) as of the Distribution Date. In addition, from and after the
Distribution Date, each such FY13-15 ATK PSU (each, an "Adjusted FY13-15 ATK
RSU") shall be adjusted so that it covers a number of shares of ATK Common
Stock determined based on the applicable PSU Performance Level, and, except as
set forth in Section 8.27 of the ATK Disclosure Letter, shall otherwise
continue to be subject to the same vesting requirements and dates and other
terms and conditions as the FY13-15 ATK PSU to which it relates, provided that
the vesting criteria applicable to such Adjusted FY13-15 ATK RSU shall provide
for solely service-based vesting.

  


 

  

(2) FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSUs held by Continuing Sporting Employees or
Sporting Former Employees. Each ATK PSU that is not an FY13-15 ATK PSU (each,
a "FY14-

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

106  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

16 or FY15-17 ATK PSU") held by an Other PSU Holder who is a Continuing
Sporting Employee or Sporting Former Employee shall, as of the Distribution,
be canceled in exchange solely for a grant of Sporting RSUs by Sporting, with
respect to the number of shares of Sporting Common Stock (rounded to the
nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of ATK
Common Stock subject to such FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSU (which number shall be
determined based on the applicable PSU Performance Level) by the Sporting
Ratio.

  


 

  

(3) FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSUs held by ATK Employees or ATK Former Employees.
Each outstanding FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSU held by an Other PSU Holder who
becomes or remains, as the case may be, an ATK Employee or an ATK Former
Employee shall, as of the Distribution, be adjusted into a time-vesting
restricted share unit that covers the number of shares of ATK Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of
shares of ATK Common Stock subject to such FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSU (which
number shall be determined by the applicable PSU Performance Level) by the ATK
Ratio (each, an "Adjusted FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK RSU"). Such Adjusted FY14-16
or FY15-17 ATK RSUs shall have the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the corresponding FY14-16 or FY15-17 ATK PSUs (except that
such award shall not be subject to any performance-based vesting conditions or
requirements and except as otherwise set forth in Section 8.27 of the ATK
Disclosure Letter).

  


 

  

(C) Vesting of Sporting RSUs. Except as set forth in this Section 8.27(a)(iii)
or in Section 8.27 of the ATK Disclosure Letter, Sporting RSUs shall be
subject to the same vesting requirements and dates and other terms and
conditions as the ATK PSUs to which they relate, provided that the vesting
criteria applicable to such Sporting RSUs shall be adjusted to provide for
solely service-based vesting.

  


 

  

(iv) ATK Deferred Stock Units; ATK Phantom Stock Units. The account balance of
each participant in an ATK Deferred Stock Unit Plan shall be credited, as of
the time of the Distribution, with respect to each deferred stock unit or
phantom stock unit payable in shares of ATK Common Stock or whose value is
determined with reference to the value of shares of ATK Common Stock held by
such participant (each such award, an "ATK DSU"), with a deferred stock unit
or phantom stock unit, as the case may be, with respect to such number of
shares of Sporting Common Stock (each, a "Sporting DSU") as determined by
applying the Distribution Ratio in the same way as if the outstanding ATK DSU
were comprised of fully vested shares of ATK Common Stock as of the
Distribution Date. Obligations in respect of ATK DSUs and Sporting DSUs shall,
taking into

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

107  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

account the provisions of Section 8.07(h) of this Agreement, be payable or
distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such ATK DSUs and Sporting DSUs and, prior to the time
of distribution, such amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in an
investment option under the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement.

  


 

  

(b) Miscellaneous Award Terms. After the Distribution Date, Adjusted ATK
Awards, regardless of by whom held, shall be settled by ATK, and Sporting
Awards, regardless of by whom held, shall be settled by Sporting. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, with respect to grants adjusted pursuant
to this Section 8.27, (i) employment or service with ATK or any ATK Subsidiary
shall be treated as employment or service with Sporting or any Sporting
Subsidiary with respect to Sporting Awards held by ATK Employees, and (ii)
employment or service with Sporting or any Sporting Subsidiary shall be
treated as employment or service with ATK or any ATK Subsidiary with respect
to Adjusted ATK Awards held by Continuing Sporting Employees. In addition,
none of the Sporting Transfers, the Distribution, or any Transition Period
Employment Transfer shall constitute a termination of employment or separation
from service for purposes of any Adjusted ATK Award or any Sporting Award.
Following the Distribution Date, for any award adjusted under this Section
8.27, any reference to a "change in control", "change of control" or similar
definition in an award agreement, employment agreement, severance plan or ATK
Stock Plan applicable to such award (A) with respect to Adjusted ATK Awards,
shall be deemed to refer to a "change in control", "change of control" or
similar definition as set forth in the applicable award agreement, employment
agreement, severance plan or ATK Stock Plan (an "ATK Change of Control"), and
(B) with respect to Sporting Awards, shall be deemed to refer to a "change in
control", "change of control" or similar definition as set forth in the
applicable Sporting award agreement, employment agreement or stock plan (a
"Sporting Change of Control"); provided, however, that with respect to
provisions related to vesting of awards, an ATK Change of Control shall be
treated as a Sporting Change of Control for purposes of Sporting Awards held
by ATK Employees (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an ATK Change of Control
shall not be treated as a Sporting Change of Control for purposes of Sporting
Awards held by Continuing Sporting Employees), and a Sporting Change of
Control shall be treated as an ATK Change of Control for purposes of Adjusted
ATK Awards held by Continuing Sporting Employees (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, a Sporting Change of Control shall not be treated as an ATK Change of
Control for purposes of Adjusted ATK Awards held by ATK Employees). After the
Distribution Date, ATK and Sporting shall mutually cooperate to provide each
party with information on the employment and termination of employment of each
person who holds an Adjusted ATK Award or a Sporting Award. After the
Distribution Date, Sporting shall not take any action to cause the accelerated
vesting of any Adjusted ATK Awards other than such non-discretionary (other
than with respect to any discretion involved in terminating an individual's
employment or service) accelerated vesting that is explicitly set forth in the
applicable award agreement or any plan, program, policy or other arrangement
in existence on the date of this Agreement (or, with respect to awards granted
not in contravention of Section 7.02(b) after the date of this Agreement, at
the time of grant) governing the treatment of ATK Awards (including upon
termination of employment) and ATK shall

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

108  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

not take any action to cause the accelerated vesting of any Sporting Award
other than such non-discretionary (other than with respect to any discretion
involved in terminating an individual's employment or service) accelerated
vesting that is explicitly set forth in the applicable award agreement or any
plan, program, policy or other arrangement in existence on the date of this
Agreement (or, with respect to awards granted after the date of this Agreement
not in contravention of Section 7.02(b), at the time of grant) governing the
treatment of Sporting Awards (including upon termination of employment).

  


 

  

(c) Sporting shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Sporting Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Sporting Awards in accordance with this Section
8.27(a). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Distribution, Sporting
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or, to the
extent applicable, other appropriate form) with respect to the Sporting Common
Stock subject to Sporting Awards and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Sporting Awards remain
outstanding.

  


 

  

(d) If Sporting or ATK determines in its reasonable judgment that any action
required under Sections 8.27(a) or (b) will not achieve the intended tax,
accounting and legal results, including the intended results under Code
Section 409A or FASB ASC Topic 718 - Stock Compensation, then at the request
of Sporting or ATK, as applicable, Sporting and ATK shall mutually cooperate
in taking such actions as are necessary or appropriate to achieve such
results, or most nearly achieve such results if the originally intended
results are not fully attainable.

  


 

  

(e) Tax Treatment.

  


 

  

(i) Except as provided in this Section 8.27(e), any Equity Compensation
Deduction arising after the Distribution Date shall be claimed (A) solely by
the party hereto (or the appropriate Subsidiary of such party, or the
successor of either) that employs the individual with respect to whom such
Equity Compensation Deduction arises at the time that it arises or (B) if such
individual is not then employed by any party hereto or a Subsidiary of any
party hereto, then by (x) ATK or its appropriate Subsidiary if the individual
is an ATK Former Employee or (y) Sporting or its appropriate Subsidiary if the
individual is a Sporting Former Employee.

  


 

  

(ii) If any taxing authority asserts that any Equity Compensation Deduction
claimed by a Claiming Party should have been claimed instead by any Other
Party, then the Claiming Party shall notify the Other Party of such assertion,
and the Other Party shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate
to claim such Equity Compensation Deduction (including, if necessary, filing
an amended Tax Return and otherwise preventing the applicable statute of
limitations from expiring).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

109  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(iii) If any Other Party successfully claims any Equity Compensation Deduction
(including as a result of a Determination), it shall promptly (but in no event
later than 20 Business Days after the Determination) pay to the Claiming Party
an amount equal to the economic benefit of such Equity Compensation Deduction
(calculated on a "with and without" basis).

  


 

  

SECTION 8.28. Closing Reconciliation.

  

  

(a) Estimated Adjusted Cash Flow Amount.

  

  

(i) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, ATK shall deliver
to Orbital a statement (the "Statement") setting forth reasonably detailed
calculations of ATK's good faith estimate of the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount
(the "Estimated Adjusted Cash Flow Amount") calculated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including the applicable definitions set forth herein
and Section 12.03(a) of the ATK Disclosure Letter). ATK shall accompany the
Statement with the March 31 Reference Balance Sheet and other reasonably
detailed back-up information utilized by ATK in preparing the Statement and
the Estimated Adjusted Cash Flow Amount (it being understood that any
inability of ATK to respond to any requests from Orbital for further back-up
information prior to the Closing shall not provide any basis to delay the
Closing in light of the procedures to calculate the actual Adjusted Cash Flow
Amount following the Closing as provided below).

  


 

  

(ii) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, ATK shall notify
Orbital in writing of the amount of the ATK Estimated Tax Payment.

  


 

  

(b) Determination of the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount.

  


 

  

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
ATK shall prepare and deliver to Sporting each of (1) the Interim Period Cash
Flow Statement and (2) a reasonably detailed calculation of the Adjusted Cash
Flow Amount and the corresponding Retained Cash Amount calculated on the basis
thereof (which calculations shall collectively be referred to herein as the
"Proposed Closing Date Calculations").

  


 

  

(ii) Sporting shall have 45 days following receipt of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations to review the Interim Period Cash Flow Statement and the
corresponding Proposed Closing Date Calculations (the "Review Period").
Sporting may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, give to ATK
written notice of dispute ("Cash Flow Dispute Notice"), which shall specify in
reasonable detail those items or amounts in ATK's preparation of the Interim
Cash Flow Statement or the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as to which
Sporting disagrees (the "Disputed Items") and the basis for such disagreement.
Prior to the end of the Review Period, Sporting may accept the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to ATK,
in which case the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and corresponding
Adjusted Cash Flow Amount and Retained Cash Amount calculated on the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

110  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

basis thereof) will become conclusive and binding when such notice is given.
Unless Sporting delivers a Cash Flow Dispute Notice to ATK prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, Sporting will be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and corresponding Adjusted
Cash Flow Amount and Retained Cash Amount calculated on the basis thereof) and
such amounts shall become conclusive and binding on ATK and Sporting. ATK or
Sporting, as the case may be, shall within five (5) Business Days of the date
of the expiration of the Review Period make the adjustment payment required by
Section 8.28(c) with respect to such undisputed items. If Sporting gives a
Cash Flow Dispute Notice to ATK on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, ATK and Sporting shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Items set forth in the Cash Flow
Dispute Notice in good faith during the 30-day period commencing on the date
ATK receives the applicable Cash Flow Dispute Notice from Sporting. If
Sporting and ATK do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to the
Disputed Items set forth in the Cash Flow Dispute Notice within such 30-day
period, then the remaining Disputed Items shall be submitted immediately by
ATK and Sporting to an independent accounting firm of national reputation
mutually acceptable to ATK and Sporting (the "Accounting Firm"). The
Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a written determination of the
Disputed Items (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) within 45 days
after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must
be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and
must be based solely on the definitions and other applicable provisions of
this Agreement with respect to the Disputed Items, on a single presentation
submitted by each of ATK and Sporting and on one written response to each such
presentation so submitted. The terms of appointment and engagement of the
Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon between Sporting and ATK, and any
associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by Sporting and 50% by
ATK; provided that such fees shall ultimately be allocated between ATK and
Sporting so that Sporting's share of such fees shall be in the same proportion
that the aggregate amount that is unsuccessfully disputed by Sporting bears to
the total amount disputed by Sporting at the time the Disputed Items were
first submitted to the Accounting Firm. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne
by the Party incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the Disputed Items,
the Accounting Firm shall resolve each Disputed Item by choosing an amount
which is either equal to or in between the amount for each Disputed Item set
forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and the amount for each
Disputed Item set forth in the Cash Flow Dispute Notice. Such determination of
the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent
fraud or manifest error. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be
revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto
pursuant to this Section 8.28(b), and, as so revised, such Proposed Closing
Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Adjusted Cash Flow
Amount (and the related Retained Cash Amount) resulting therefrom (which shall
be equal to the Estimated Retained Cash Amount as adjusted solely to give
effect to any differences between Estimated Adjusted Cash Flow Amount and
Adjusted Cash Flow Amount (in each case fully determined in accordance with
this Section 8.28), in each case, for all purposes hereunder.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

111  

  

 

 

 

  

  


 

  

(iii) Each of ATK and Sporting shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, make their respective financial records and personnel
available to the other Party and its accountants and other representatives at
reasonable times at any time during ATK's preparation of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations or the review by Sporting of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations, as applicable, as well as during the resolution of any Disputed
Items.

  

  

(iv) ATK and Sporting agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 8.28
for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date Calculations
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any Disputed Items;
provided that this provision shall not prohibit either party from instituting
litigation to enforce any final determination of the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount
and Retained Cash Amount resulting therefrom by the Accounting Firm pursuant
to Section 8.28(b)(ii) in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Section 12.11. The substance of the Accounting Firm's determination shall
not be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest
error. It is the intent of the Parties to have any final determination of the
Adjusted Cash Flow Amount and Retained Cash Amount resulting therefrom by the
Accounting Firm proceed in an expeditious manner; however, any deadline or
time period contained herein may be extended or modified by the written
agreement of the parties and the parties agree that the failure of the
Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained
herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered
by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the terms of this Section
8.28(b).

  

  

(c) Adjustment to Estimated Retained Cash Amount.

  


 

  

(i) If the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjusted
Cash Flow Amount, Sporting shall pay to ATK an amount equal to such difference
by wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds, in each case,
within three Business Days after the date on which the Adjusted Cash Flow
Amount is determined pursuant to this Section 8.28.

  

  

(ii) If the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount is less than the Estimated Adjusted Cash
Flow Amount, ATK shall pay to Sporting an amount equal to such difference by
wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds, in each case, within
three Business Days after the date on which the Adjusted Cash Flow Amount is
determined pursuant to this Section 8.28.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.29. Supply Agreement; Transition Services Agreement.

  


 

  

(a) Following the date of this Agreement, the parties will negotiate in good
faith to finalize the terms of the Supply Agreement (which agreement shall be
finalized as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the
Distribution Date).

  


 

  

(b) Following the date of this Agreement, the parties will negotiate in good
faith to finalize the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, including
the nature and scope of the specific services to be provided to Sporting under
the Transition

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

112  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Services Agreement (which agreement shall be finalized as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the Distribution Date). The services to
be covered by the Transition Services Agreement will include those categories
of services previously identified by ATK to Orbital and reasonably agreed by
the parties, but in any event shall provide Sporting with those corporate and
administrative services currently provided to the Sporting Business by ATK and
its Subsidiaries and necessary for Sporting to operate on a stand-alone basis
following the Distribution Date.

(iii) if the Orbital Stockholder Approval has not been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote taken at the Orbital

reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document. For the avoidance of doubt, the

concurrently with payment of the ATK Termination Fee, if an ATK Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to Section 10.03(b), or (ii) if this Agreement is

other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  


 

  

SECTION 10.06. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.04 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 10.05 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of any of
the parties hereto, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized
designee of its Board of Directors. After the Orbital Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.04 that
by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of Orbital shall be
effective only with the approval of such stockholders. After the ATK
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, any amendment of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.04 that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of ATK shall be effective only with the approval of such
stockholders. After the consummation of the Distribution, any amendment of

120  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(iii) any Liability the release of which would result in the release of any
Person other than a Person released pursuant to this Section 11.01.

  


 

  

(d) Sporting shall not, and shall not permit any Sporting Subsidiary to, make
any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand,
including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against ATK or any
ATK Subsidiary (including Orbital and its Subsidiaries), or any other Person
released pursuant to Section 11.01(a), with respect to any Liabilities
released pursuant to Section 11.01(a). ATK shall not, and shall not permit any
ATK Subsidiary (including Orbital and its Subsidiaries) to, make any claim or
demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any
claim of contribution or any indemnification, against Sporting or any Sporting
Subsidiary or any other Person released pursuant to Section 11.01(b), with
respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 11.01(b).

  


 

  

(e) At any time, at the request of any other party hereto, each of the parties
hereto shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to

ATK shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sporting, each Sporting
Subsidiary and each of their Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the "Sporting Indemnitees") from and against any and all
claims, losses, damages (including, in the case of Third Party Claims, any
exemplary or punitive damages whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Law or otherwise) or expenses, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses (collectively, "Losses"), to the extent arising or resulting
from any of the following:

  


 

  

(a) any Excluded Liability; and

  


 

  

(b) any breach of any covenant of ATK, Orbital or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement that survives the Effective Time pursuant to Section 12.01.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.03. Indemnification by Sporting. From and after the Distribution
Date, Sporting shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ATK, each ATK
Subsidiary (including, after the Effective Time, Orbital and its Subsidiaries)
and each of their Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the "ATK Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses, to
the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

  


 

  

(a) any Sporting Liability; and

  


 

  

(b) any breach of any covenant of Sporting contained in this Agreement that
survives the Effective Time pursuant to Section 12.01.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.04. Indemnification Procedures. (a) Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims. If any party (the "Indemnified Party")
receives written notice of the commencement of any Action or the assertion of
any claim by a

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

121  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment, or is otherwise
subject to any Action, including any Action in existence on the Closing Date,
in each case for which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.02 or 11.03 (a
"Third Party Claim"), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
pursuant to this Article XI, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the
other party (the "Indemnifying Party") with written notice of such Third Party
Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known,
along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim
and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on
account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall actively pursue such defense in good faith, (ii) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except as
contemplated by the following sentence) and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or
(B) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement
provides for (x) relief other than money damages or (y) money damages if the
Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing that it shall be
responsible for such money damages, in the case of each of clauses (A) and
(B), without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably agree that a conflict
of interest exists in respect of a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to retain separate counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to
represent the Indemnified Party in the defense of the Third Party Claim, and
the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if
the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or
relief other than monetary damages against the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for monetary damages. Each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third
Party Claims and shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against,
settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties shall also keep
each other reasonably informed with respect to any Third Party Claim,
cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and give each other
reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party shall not
be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

122  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

consented to by the Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent.

  


 

  

(b) Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. The Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter that
does not involve a Third Party Claim giving rise to the claim of indemnity
pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from
receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist
the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity
by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such
assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and
copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.05. Indemnification as Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Subject to
Section 11.07(a), ATK, Orbital, Merger Sub and Sporting acknowledge and agree
that, following the consummation of the Distribution, ATK's, Orbital's, Merger
Sub's and Sporting's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to Article I or II, the Sporting Business, the Sporting
Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Sporting Liabilities, the Excluded
Liabilities, the Sporting Transfers or the Distribution shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XI. In furtherance of
the foregoing and subject to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article XI, ATK, Orbital, Merger Sub and Sporting hereby waive, from and after
the Distribution Date, any and all rights, claims and causes of action ATK or
any other ATK Indemnitee, on the one hand, and Sporting or any other Sporting
Indemnitee, on the other hand, may have against Sporting or any of its
Affiliates or, respectively, ATK or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
Representatives, in each case arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise
(including with respect to environmental matters generally and any matters
under Environmental Laws). This Section 11.05 will not apply to any breach
following the Distribution Date of any other Section of this Agreement, the
Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Supply
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 11.05 will not apply to specific performance and equitable relief as
provided in Section 12.10.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.06. Calculation of Indemnity Payments. (a) The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under this Article XI shall be net of
any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with
respect to such Loss.

  


 

  

(b) An Indemnifying Party is authorized, in connection with payment of any
Loss for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party under
this Article XI, to set off and apply any and all payments due to such
Indemnifying Party

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

123  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

under this Article XI against any of and all of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party under this Article XI. The rights
of the Indemnifying Party under this Section 11.06(b) are in addition (but
without duplication) to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
set-off) which such Indemnifying Party may have.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.07. Additional Matters. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, indemnification for Tax matters shall be governed
by the terms, provisions and procedures of the Tax Matters Agreement and not
by this Article XI.

  


 

  

(b) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for special, punitive,
exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, or lost profits,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise,
except to the extent that such damages are actually payable by the Indemnified
Party in connection with a Third Party Claim.

  


 

  

(c) The indemnity agreement in this Article XI shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of any (a) investigation made by or on behalf
of any Indemnified Party and (b) the knowledge by the Indemnified Party of any
Losses for which it may be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

guidance, estimates, milestones, budgets or internal or published financial or
operating predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it
being understood that the exceptions in clauses (7), (8) and (9) shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any
such change, decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling
within any of the exceptions provided by clause (A) and clauses (B)(1) through
(9) hereof) is an ATK Material Adverse Effect); provided further, however,
that any effect, change, event or occurrence referred to in clause (A) or
clauses (B)(3) or (4) may be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, an ATK Material Adverse
Effect to the extent such effect, change, event or occurrence has a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the ATK Business as compared to other
participants in the industry in which the ATK Business operates.

SECTION 12.04. Interpretation; Disclosure Letters. (a) When a reference is
made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" when
used in this Agreement shall refer to the date of this Agreement. The terms
"or", "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". The words
"made available to ATK", "made available to Sporting", "made available to
Merger Sub" and words of similar import refer to documents (A) posted to the
Intralinks virtual dataroom by or on behalf of Orbital or (B) delivered in
person or electronically to ATK, Sporting, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives. The words "made available to Orbital" and words of similar
import refer to documents (A) posted to the Intralinks virtual dataroom by or
on behalf of ATK, Sporting or Merger Sub or (B) delivered in person or
electronically to Orbital or its Representatives. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms. Each of the parties hereto has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

142  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Any matter disclosed in any section of the Orbital Disclosure Letter or
the ATK Disclosure Letter shall qualify the correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant and any other representation and
warranty or covenant of Orbital or, as applicable, ATK, Sporting and Merger
Sub to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to such other
representation and warranty or covenant is reasonably apparent from the
content and context of such disclosure.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.07. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Other
Representations or Warranties. (a) The Transaction Documents, taken together
with the Orbital Disclosure Letter and the ATK Disclosure Letter, constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
Transactions and are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies; provided that the New Sporting Debt
Financing Sources shall be intended third party beneficiaries of Sections
10.04, 10.06, 12.08, 12.11 and 12.12 and shall be entitled to enforce such
provisions directly (and no amendment or modification to such provisions that
would adversely affect the rights of the New Sporting Debt Financing Sources
may be made without the prior written consent of the New Sporting Debt
Financing Sources). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
following the Effective Time, the provisions of Section 8.09 shall be
enforceable by the specified beneficiaries thereof. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement (including the Orbital
Disclosure Letter and the ATK Disclosure Letter and Annexes and Exhibits
hereto), on the one hand, and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents (including the schedules and exhibits
thereto), on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

  

  

(b) Each of ATK, Sporting and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties contained in Article V, neither Orbital
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person makes any representation or
warranty, express or implied, with respect to Orbital, its Subsidiaries, the
Orbital Business or with respect to any information furnished, disclosed or
otherwise made available to ATK,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

143  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Sporting, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives in the course
of their due diligence investigation of the Orbital Business and the
negotiation of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions. Except pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, neither Orbital nor any other Person
shall be subject to any Liability or responsibility whatsoever to ATK,
Sporting, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under securities Laws or otherwise) resulting
from or based upon Orbital's furnishing, disclosing or otherwise making
available any information, documents or material in any form to ATK, Sporting,
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling Persons
or Representatives, including in any data room or management presentations
(formal or informal) and including any financial statements and any
projections, forecasts, budgets, estimates or other forward-looking
information, or the use of any such information.

  


 

  

(c) Orbital acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article VI, none of ATK, Sporting, Merger Sub or any
other Subsidiary of ATK nor any other Person makes any representation or
warranty, express or implied, with respect to ATK, the ATK Subsidiaries,
Sporting, the Sporting Subsidiaries, the Sporting Assets, the Sporting
Liabilities, the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities, the Sporting
Business or the ATK Business or with respect to any information furnished,
disclosed or otherwise made available to Orbital or any of its Representatives
in the course of their due diligence investigation of the ATK Business, the
Sporting Business or otherwise and the negotiation of this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions. Except pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, none of
ATK, Sporting, Merger Sub or any other Person shall be subject to any
Liability or responsibility whatsoever to Orbital or any of its Affiliates or
any of its stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under securities Laws or otherwise) resulting
from or based upon ATK's, Sporting's, Merger Sub's or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives' furnishing, disclosing or otherwise making
available any information, documents or material in any form to Orbital or its
Affiliates, stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives, including in
any data room or management presentations (formal or informal) and including
any financial statements and any projections, forecasts, budgets, estimates or
other forward-looking information, or the use of any such information.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.08. Governing Law; Contract Under Seal. (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof. This Agreement shall be treated and
construed as a contract under seal under the Laws of the State of Delaware
with all of the consequences of such a contract, including causing the
Agreement to be subject to the twenty-year limitations period applicable to
sealed instruments.

upon

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

144  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

contract or tort or otherwise) to which a New Sporting Debt Financing Source
is a party that is in any way related to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the New Sporting Debt Financing or the Sporting Commitment Letter, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.10. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of any Transaction

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any
Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
each Transaction Document in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or,
if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in any state or federal court within the State of Delaware, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.11. Jurisdiction. (a) Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware or, if the Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, of any state or federal court within the State of Delaware
in the event any dispute arises out of any Transaction Document or any
Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to any
Transaction Document or any Transaction in any court other than the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware or, if the Chancery Court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the

third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the New Sporting Debt

Financing or the Sporting Commitment Letter, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the New Sporting Debt

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

145  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof), and that the provisions of this Section 12.11 relating to the waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim.

  


 

  

SECTION 12.12. Waiver of Direct Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Orbital (on behalf of itself and any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby
waives any rights or claims against any New Sporting Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the New Sporting Debt Financing, the Sporting

equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or
written representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith and Orbital (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding against any New Sporting Debt Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the New Sporting Debt Financing, the
