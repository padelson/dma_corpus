         Exhibit A        Form of Company Tender and Voting Agreement



                                       -iv-

<PAGE>


                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of
November 24, 2000, by and among Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("PARENT"), Tahoe Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Objective Systems
Integrators, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY" or "COMPANY").

                                    RECITALS

         A. The Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
each (i) determined that the Merger (as defined in Section 2.1) is advisable and
fair and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and (ii)
approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; B. In furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall,
as promptly as practicable, commence a tender offer (the "OFFER") to acquire all
of the outstanding shares (the "SHARES") of Company Common Stock (as defined in
Section 2.6), at a price of Seventeen Dollars and Seventy Five Cents ($17.75)
per Share, net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any greater amount per
share paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the "OFFER
PRICE"), in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions provided
herein; and C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
affiliates of Company are entering into Tender and Voting Agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "COMPANY TENDER AND
VOTING AGREEMENTS").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    THE OFFER

         1.1  The Offer.

         (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated and
subject to the terms hereof, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than ten business days after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT")), the Offer for
any and all of the Shares, at the Offer Price. The obligation of Merger Sub to
accept for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered (and the obligation of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares
tendered) shall be subject only to (i) the condition that

<PAGE>


each of (A) a majority of Shares on a fully-diluted basis (including for
purposes of such calculation all Shares issuable upon exercise of all vested
Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 6.8(a)) and unvested Company Stock
Options that vest prior to the End Date (as defined in Section 8.1, but
excluding any Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) and (B) a
majority of those Shares not held by persons who have executed Company Tender
and Voting Agreements be validly tendered (but excluding any Shares held by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) (collectively, the "MINIMUM
CONDITION"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex A. Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that unless
previously approved by the Company in writing, no change may be made that (i)
decreases the Offer Price, (ii) changes the form of consideration to be paid in
the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) imposes any other conditions to the Offer or amends the conditions
set forth in Annex A to broaden the scope of such conditions, (v) extends the
Offer except as provided in Section 1.1(b), (vi) amends or waives the Minimum
Condition or (vii) amends any other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to
the holders of the Shares. It is agreed that the conditions set forth in Annex A
are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent
and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in their
sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, as to which prior written
Company approval is required. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted
at any time and from time to time. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

         (b) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall expire
at midnight, New York Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days after
the date the Offer is commenced; provided, however, that without the consent of
the Company's Board of Directors (the "COMPANY BOARD"), Merger Sub may (i) from
time to time extend the Offer, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer
any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived,
until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived; (ii) extend the
Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer; (iii) if the number of Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer is less than 90% of the outstanding Shares but at least 80% of the
outstanding Shares, extend the Offer for any reason on one or more occasions for
an aggregate period of not more than ten (10) business days beyond the latest
expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of
this sentence if on such expiration date there shall not have been tendered (and
not properly withdrawn) at least 90% of the outstanding Shares; or (iv) include
a subsequent offering period (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1 under the
Exchange Act) to the Offer for a period up to twenty (20) business days. Parent
and Merger Sub agree that, if any one or more of the conditions to the Offer set
forth on Annex A are not satisfied and none of the events set forth in
paragraphs (b), (d), (e) or (h) of Annex A that would permit Merger Sub not to
accept tendered Shares for payment has occurred and is continuing at the time of
any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied in Parent and Merger Sub's reasonable
judgment, Merger Sub shall, at the request of the Company, extend the Offer from
time to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being
satisfied or any such event has


                                       2
<PAGE>


occurred; provided, however, that in no event shall Merger Sub be required to
extend the Offer beyond January 31, 2001. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for
payment and pay for pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer.

         (c) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent
and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase
(or portions thereof) and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement. Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the Schedule
TO, the Offer to Purchase and all amendments or supplements thereto (which
together constitute the "OFFER DOCUMENTS") to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other Legal
Requirements (as defined in Section 3.3). Parent and Merger Sub further agree
that the Offer Documents, on the date first published, sent or given to the
Company's stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by
the Company or any of its stockholders in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. The Company agrees that the
information provided by the Company in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so
corrected to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub
agree to provide in writing to the Company and its counsel with any comments
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments.

         1.2 Company Actions.

         (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) after evaluating the
Merger, determined that this Agreement and the transactions


                                       3
<PAGE>


contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken together, are at
a price and on terms that are fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects; and
(iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the
Offer, tender their Shares thereunder to Merger Sub and approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger, in each case, subject to the right of the Company
Board to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation and to recommend
a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of Section 6.4. To the extent
that such recommendation is not so withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified, the
Company consents to the inclusion of such recommendation and approval in the
Offer Documents.

         (b) The Company shall file with the SEC, concurrently with the filing
of the Schedule TO, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") containing the recommendations described
in and subject to Section 1.2(a) and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company, together with the Offer Documents, promptly
after the commencement of the Offer. The Company agrees that it shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other Legal Requirements. The Company
further agrees that the Schedule 14D-9, on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company's stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Merger Sub agree
that the information provided by them specifically in writing for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be
disseminated to the Company's stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide in writing to
Parent and its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt
of such comments.

         (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or shall cause its
transfer agent, promptly following a request by Parent, to furnish Parent with
such information, including updated lists of the stockholders of the Company,
mailing labels and updated lists of security positions, and such assistance as
Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to any Legal Requirements, and
except for such

                                       4
<PAGE>

steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their
agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver, and
will use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the
Company all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in
their possession or control.

         (d) Solely in connection with the tender and purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger, the Company hereby
waives any and all rights of first refusal it may have with respect to Shares
owned by, or issuable to, any person, other than rights to repurchase unvested
shares, if any, that may be held by persons pursuant to the grant of restricted
stock purchase rights or following exercise of employee stock options.

         1.3 Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange Act.

         (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and from time to time thereafter, if the Minimum Condition has been met,
and subject to the second to last sentence of this Section 1.3(a), Parent shall
be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company Board as will give Parent representation on the
Company Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
Section 1.3) and the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased bears to
the total number of outstanding Shares, and the Company shall use its best
efforts to, upon request by Parent, promptly, at the Company's election, either
increase the size of the Company Board or secure the resignation of such number
of directors as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the
Company Board and to cause Parent's designees to be so elected. At such times,
and subject to the second to last sentence of this Section 1.3(a), the Company
shall use its best efforts to cause the individuals designated by Parent to
constitute the same percentage as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee
of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary of the
Company (subject to Legal Requirements and except to the extent described in
Section 1.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and (iii) each committee of
each such board of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
use its best efforts to ensure that two of the members of the Company Board as
of the date hereof (the "CONTINUING DIRECTORS") shall remain members of such
Board until the Effective Time. If a Continuing Director resigns from the
Company Board, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall permit the remaining
Continuing Director or Directors to appoint the resigning Director's successor
who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director.

         (b) The Company's obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to such
Section and Rule in


                                       5
<PAGE>


order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent shall supply to the Company in
writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and
its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section and
Rule.

         (c) Following the date of the election or appointment of Parent's
designees to the Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the
Effective Time (the "APPOINTMENT DATE"), if there shall be any Continuing
Directors, any amendment of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub or any waiver of any of
the Company's rights hereunder or any other determination with respect to any
action to be taken or not to be taken by the Company relating to this Agreement,
will require the concurrence of a majority of such Continuing Directors.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE MERGER

cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash
payment, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the cash payment.

         (d) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock


                                       8
<PAGE>

in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

         (e) Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or
foreign law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

         (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.7, neither the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         2.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.

         The cash consideration issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

         2.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

         In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the cash consideration pursuant to Section 2.6; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of such cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         2.10 Dissenters' Rights.

         If any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to be paid the "fair
market value" of such Dissenting Shareholder's Shares, as provided in Section
262 of the DGCL, Company shall give Parent notice thereof and Parent shall have
the right to direct in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Neither Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting


                                       9
<PAGE>

Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
the right to dissent, the Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration set forth in Article II.

         2.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.

         If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub,
the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful
and necessary action.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

         Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to
such exceptions as are disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter supplied by
Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the "COMPANY SCHEDULE"), which
disclosure shall provide an exception to or otherwise qualify the
representations and warranties of Company contained in the section of this
Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure, as follows:

         3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

         (a) Each of Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to do so
would not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 9.3 below) on Company. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
variances, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("APPROVALS")
necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate
or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where
the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company and its subsidiaries have
been and are in compliance with the terms of the Approvals, except where the
failure to or have been in compliance would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.

         (b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Schedule lists each of Company's
subsidiaries, the jurisdiction of incorporation of each such subsidiary, and
Company's equity interest therein. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries
has agreed nor is obligated to make nor is bound by any written or oral
agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument,
note, option, warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy,
benefit plan, commitment or undertaking of any nature, as of the date hereof or
as may hereafter be in effect (a "CONTRACT") under which it may become obligated
to make, any future investment in or capital contribution to

                                       10
<PAGE>

any other entity. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in or any interest convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business, association or
entity.

         (c) Company and each of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the laws of all
jurisdictions where the nature of their business requires such qualification and
where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

         3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

         Company has previously furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy
of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to date (together, the
"COMPANY CHARTER DOCUMENTS"). Such Company Charter Documents and equivalent
organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries are in full force and
effect. Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company
Charter Documents, and no subsidiary of Company is in violation of its
equivalent organizational documents except where the violation of any such
equivalent organizational documents of a subsidiary of Company would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

         (a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of November 17,

<PAGE>

as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), state securities laws ("BLUE SKY LAWS"), the
pre-merger notification requirements (the "HSR APPROVAL") of the

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company or, after the Effective Time, Parent, or (B) would not prevent
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the parties hereto from
performing their obligations under this Agreement.

         3.6 Compliance; Permits.

         (a) Definitions.

               (i) "Hazardous Material" is any material or substance that is
prohibited or regulated by any Environmental Law or that has been designated by
any governmental authority to be radioactive, toxic, hazardous or otherwise a
danger to health, reproduction or the environment.

               (ii) "Environmental Laws" are all applicable Laws, rules,
regulations, orders, treaties, statutes, and codes promulgated by any
governmental authority which prohibit, regulate or control any Hazardous
Material or any Hazardous Material activity, including, without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,
the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act of 1976, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the
Clean Water Act, comparable laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, orders,
treaties, statutes, and codes of other governmental authorities, the regulations
promulgated pursuant to any of the foregoing, and all amendments and
modifications of any of the foregoing, all as amended to date.

         (b) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of, any law, rule (including Environmental Laws),
regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Company or any of its
subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties is bound or
affected, except where such conflict, default or violation does not have or
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any governmental or regulatory body or authority is
pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or its
subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or regulatory body or authority indicated
to Company an intention to conduct the same, other than, in each such case,
those the outcome of which could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing
any business practice of Company or any of its subsidiaries, any acquisition of
material property by Company or any of its subsidiaries or the conduct of
business by Company or any of its subsidiaries.


                                       14
<PAGE>

         (c) The Company has not disposed of, released, discharged or emitted
any Hazardous Materials into the soil or groundwater at any properties owned or
leased at any time by the Company, or at any other property, or exposed any
employee or other individual to any Hazardous Materials or any workplace or
environmental condition in such a manner as would result in any material
liability or clean-up obligation of any kind or nature to the Company. To the
knowledge of Company, no Hazardous Materials are present in, on, or under any
properties owned, leased or used at any time by the Company, and no reasonable
likelihood exists that any Hazardous Materials will come to be present in, on,
or under any properties owned, leased or used at any time by the Company, so as
to give rise to any material liability or clean-up obligation under any
Environmental Laws.

         3.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

         (a) Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement
filed by Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since
December 31, 1998 (the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS"), which are all the forms, reports
and documents required to be filed by Company with the SEC since such time. The
Company SEC Reports (i) in all material respects were prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and (ii)
did not at the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of Company's subsidiaries is required
to file any reports or other documents with the SEC.

         (b) Each set of consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports, (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and each fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Company and its
subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited
interim financial statements were or are subject to normal adjustments which
were not or are not expected to be material in amount.

         (c) Company has previously furnished to Parent a complete and correct
copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the
SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by Company with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

         (d) Company has furnished monthly unaudited balance sheets, income
statements and, if available, statements of cash flows within 30 days of the end
of the month then ended, and


                                       15
<PAGE>

such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company as of and for each month
then ended.

         3.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities.

         Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities

provision in the Company's accounts (or the accounts of any subsidiary or

         (b) Neither the Company nor any of the subsidiaries has received from a
third party any written notice of infringement or misappropriation of or
conflict with, in any material respects, Company Intellectual Property. To the
knowledge of the Company, the use of such Company Intellectual property in
connection with the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
does not infringe, in any material respects, on the rights of any person or
entity. No material claim by any third party contesting the validity,
enforceability, use or ownership of any of


                                       25

subsidiaries, is currently outstanding or is, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened. The Company has not received any written notices of any material
infringement or misappropriation by any third party with respect to the Company
Intellectual Property. Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken reasonable
actions to maintain and protect its Company Intellectual Property, except for
those actions, which the failure to take, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) As used herein, "COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" means all

proprietary rights, used or held for use in connection with the businesses of
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted by the Company,
together with all applications currently pending or in process for any of the
foregoing.

         (d) Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps to
protect Company's and its subsidiaries' rights in Company's confidential
information and trade secrets that it wishes to protect or any trade secrets or
confidential information of third parties provided to Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and, without limiting the foregoing, each of Company and its
subsidiaries has and uses its best efforts to enforce a policy requiring each
employee and contractor to execute a proprietary information/confidentiality
agreement substantially in the form provided to Parent and all current and
former employees and contractors of Company and any of its subsidiaries have
executed such an agreement, except where the failure to do so is not reasonably
expected to be material to Company.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

         Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Company, subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in writing in the
disclosure letter supplied by Parent to Company dated as of the date hereof (the
"PARENT SCHEDULE"), which disclosure shall provide an exception to


                                       28
<PAGE>

or otherwise qualify the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
contained in the section of this Agreement corresponding by number to such
disclosure, as follows:

         4.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

         Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is in possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease and
operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         4.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

         Parent has previously furnished to Company complete and correct copies
of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to date (together, the
"PARENT CHARTER DOCUMENTS"). Such Company Charter Documents and equivalent
organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries are in full force and
effect. Parent is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company
Charter Documents, and no subsidiary of Company is in violation of any of its
equivalent organizational documents.

         4.3 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

         Each of Parent and/or Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Noncompetition
Agreements and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Noncompetition Agreements by Parent and/or Merger Sub and
the consummation by Parent and/or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Parent and/or Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions so contemplated. Each of the Transaction Agreements
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and/or Merger Sub
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
thereto, constitutes a legal and binding obligation of Parent and/or Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and/or Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
except with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that have not had, and could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of

indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party
or by which Parent or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their respective
properties are bound or affected, except to the extent such conflict, violation,
breach, default, impairment or other effect could not in the case of clauses
(ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

         (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Noncompetition
Agreements, by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub shall not, require any consent, approval,

records and personnel of Company during the period prior to the Effective Time
to obtain all information


                                       35
<PAGE>

concerning the business, including the status of
product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of
Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained
by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

         6.4 No Solicitation.

         (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, Company and its
subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce or knowingly encourage the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions
with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company,
the Company Board (or any duly appointed and empowered committee thereof (a
"SPECIAL COMMITTEE")) or any director of the Company from (i) complying with
Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
tender or exchange offer not made after a violation of this Section 6.4, (ii)
making such disclosures to Company's stockholders as in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board (or a Special Committee), after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, is required under applicable Law or (iii) in response to
an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
(or a Special Committee) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal
(as defined below), engaging in discussions or participating in negotiations
with and furnishing information to the party making such Acquisition Proposal to
the extent (A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel that its fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law require it to do so, (B) (x) at least two business days prior to furnishing
any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such party, Company gives Parent written notice of Company's intention to
furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, such party and (y) Company receives from such party an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such party
by or on behalf of Company, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such party, Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by Company to Parent). Company and its subsidiaries will
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.4 by any officer, director, affiliate


                                       36
<PAGE>

or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4 by Company.

         For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall mean
any expression of interest, offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by Parent) relating to any Acquisition Transaction; (ii) "ACQUISITION
TRANSACTION" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from Company by any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of
more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially
owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving Company pursuant to which the shareholders of
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer,
license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or
disposition of more than 15% of the assets of Company; or (C) any liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of
Company; and (iii) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" shall mean an Acquisition Proposal
relating to the acquisition (by means of any of the structural means described
in clauses (A) or (B) of the definition of Acquisition Transaction) of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities, or all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Company with respect to which (A) if any cash consideration
is involved, no financing contingency exists or the Company Board shall have
concluded in good faith (after consultation with Company's financial advisors)
that the acquiring party is reasonably likely to obtain any necessary financing,
and (B) the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith that the proposed
Acquisition Transaction provides greater value to the stockholders of Company
than the Offer and the Merger (based upon the advice of Company's financial
advisors).

         (b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.4, Company as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within one business day, shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any
request for information which Company reasonably believes would lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect
to or which Company reasonably believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal;
the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry; and the identity of the person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. In
addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i) provide Parent with at least 48
hours prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of the Company Board but in no


                                       37
<PAGE>

event less than eight hours) of any meeting of the Company Board at which
Company's Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) provide Parent with at least two (2) business days prior written notice (or
such lesser prior notice as provided to members of the Company Board but in no
event less than eight hours) of a meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Proposal to its
shareholders and together with such notice a copy of the definitive
documentation relating to such Superior Proposal.

         6.5 Public Disclosure.

         Parent and Company will consult with each other, and to the extent
practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Offer, this Agreement or an Acquisition
Proposal and will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law or any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party will be made prior to any such release
or public statement. 6.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
taking of all commercially reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the
defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
 the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use
all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates
of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and
stock.


                                       38
<PAGE>

         (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

         (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent or Merger
Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement.

         6.7 Third Party Consents.

         As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and Company
will each use best efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under
any of its or its subsidiaries' respective agreements, contracts, licenses or
leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. 6.8 Stock Options and Employee Benefits.

         (a) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") under
the Company Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger
be substituted with an equivalent option under Parent's option plan. Each
Company Stock Option so substituted by Parent under this Agreement and will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
product of that fraction of a share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK") obtained by dividing $17.75 by the average
of the closing prices of Parent's Common Stock as quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the
closing date (the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such substituted Company
Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the product of the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall comply with
the terms of all such substituted Company Stock Options and use its best efforts
to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the
Company Option Plans and permitted under the Code that any Company Stock


                                       39
<PAGE>

Options that qualified for tax treatment under Section 424(b) of the Code prior
to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the Effective Time. Parent
shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery pursuant to the terms set
forth in this Section 6.8 (a).

         (b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Company agrees that it shall take
such actions as is necessary(i) to provide that the shares of the Company Common
Stock to be purchased under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be
purchased under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a "New Exercise
Date" (as such term is defined in the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan) set
by the Board of Directors, which Exercise Date shall be on the last trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to provide that immediately
following such purchase of shares of Company Common Stock the Company Employee
Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate.

         (c) 401(k) Plan. Company shall terminate, effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans unless Parent
provides notice to Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated.
Parent shall receive from Company evidence that Company's plan(s) and /or
program(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of each such entity's
Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject
to review and approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding
the Effective Time. (d) Benefit Plans; Credit for Past Service. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to provide employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with benefits (including welfare benefits) that are
substantially similar as it provides to its similarly-situated employees. To the
extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances
(including flexible time off) under any plan, program or arrangement of the
Merger Sub and/or Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall ensure that such
plan, program or arrangement shall credit employees for service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, no such
service shall be credited for any purpose under Parent's pension plan and
Parent's retiree health plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.8(d) to
the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.8(d) shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the right of the Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate employment or change the place of work,
responsibilities, status or description of any employee or group of employees as
the Parent, Merger Sub or Surviving Corporation may determine in its discretion.

         6.9 Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.

         The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

         6.10 [Intentionally omitted.]


                                       40
<PAGE>

         6.11 Indemnification.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its directors and
officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") and any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents
as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of Company,
unless such modification is required by law.

         (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause to be maintained in effect, if available, directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with respect to
claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before
the Effective Time in an amount and on terms comparable to those applicable to
the current directors and officers of Company; provided, however, that in no
event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual
premium for such coverage in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid
by Company; provided, further, that if the premium for such coverage exceeds
such amount, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy
with the greatest coverage available for 150% of the annual premium currently
paid by Company.

         (c) In the event Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers a material amount of its
properties and assets to any person in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent will either guaranty the
indemnification obligations referred to in this Section 6.11 or will make or
cause to be made proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Company
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification
obligations described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties. (d) The
provisions of this Section 6.11 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

         6.12 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts.

         As soon as may be reasonably practicable, Company and Parent each shall
file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ")
Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein
as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms
required by the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any
applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Except where prohibited by
applicable Law, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Company and Parent
each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be
required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional
information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which
the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

         7.1 Conditions.

         The respective obligations of each party to consummate the Merger shall
be subject to the satisfaction or waiver, where permissible, prior to the
Effective Time, of the following conditions: (a) Stockholder Approval. If
approval of the Merger by the holders of Shares is required by applicable Law,
the Merger shall have been duly approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of each class of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger,
in accordance with applicable Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company; (b) Purchase of Shares. Merger Sub (or Parent) shall have
purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer; and (c) No Order. No court or other
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
which is in effect and prohibits consummation of the Merger (collectively, an
"ORDER").

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         8.1 Termination.

         This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Effective Date (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement
by the stockholders of Company):

         (a) by mutual written agreement of Company and Parent; or

         (b) by either Company or Parent, if:


                                       42
<PAGE>

               (i) the Offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement without Parent or Merger Sub having accepted
for exchange any Shares pursuant to the Offer, provided that Parent and Merger
Sub shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(i) if the Offer is terminated or expires without Shares having been
accepted for exchange as a result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement; or

               (ii) the Offer has not been consummated on or before January 31,
2001 (the "END DATE"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Offer to have been
consummated on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes
a material breach of this Agreement; or

               (iii) there shall be any applicable Law or regulation that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental body having competent
jurisdiction enjoining Company or Parent from consummating the Merger is entered
and such judgment, injunction, judgment or order shall have become final and
nonappealable; or

               (iv) Prior to the Appointment Date (A) any of the representations
and warranties of the other party set forth in this Agreement shall not be true
and correct in all respects (unless such failures to be true and correct,
without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications or exceptions contained therein, do not, or could not reasonably
be expected to, constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Company),
in each case (i) as of the date referred to in any representation or warranty
which addresses matters as of a particular date, or (ii) as to all other
representations and warranties of the other party, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer, or (B) the other
party shall have failed to perform in any material respect any material
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any material agreement or
covenant of such party to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement; provided, however, that such inaccuracy or failure to perform has not
been or is incapable of being cured by such other party within 30 days following
receipt by the terminating party of notice of such inaccuracy or failure to
perform;

         (c) by Parent if a Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

         (d) by Company, if the Offer has not been commenced by the Parent or
Merger Sub on or prior to ten (10) business days following the date of the
initial public announcement of the Offer, provided, that Company may not
terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if Company is in
material breach of this Agreement.

         For purposes of this Agreement, a "TRIGGERING EVENT" shall be deemed to
have occurred if, prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Board of Directors of
Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended to Company
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of Company or
any committee thereof shall for any reason have withdrawn or shall


                                       43
<PAGE>

have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation in
favor of the Offer, the adoption and approval of the Agreement or the approval
of the Merger (the "RECOMMENDATIONS"); (iii) Company shall have failed to
include the Recommendations in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9; (iv)
Company shall have breached the provisions of Section 6.4; or (v) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been commenced or otherwise publicly announced by a person
unaffiliated with Parent, and Company shall not, within 10 business days after
such commencement or public announcement, publicly recommended to the Company's
stockholders rejection of such Acquisition Proposal.

         The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

         8.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.

         Any proper termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 above will
be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating
party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
parties hereto, except (i) as set forth in this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach of or fraud in connection with this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their terms. In the event that Company gives
Parent notice of an inaccuracy or failure to perform such that this Agreement
would be subject to termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv), Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to not consummate the Offer until such inaccuracy or failure to
perform is cured.

         8.3 Fees and Expenses.

         (a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and Company
shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and accountants
fees and expenses, in relation to the printing, filing and mailing of the
Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto.

         (b) Company Payments. If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
Company, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Sections
8.1(b)(i) or (ii) or Section 8.1(c), Company shall promptly, but in any event no
later than two days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal
to $22,600,000 in immediately available funds (the "TERMINATION FEE"); provided,
that in the case of a termination under Section 8.1(b)(i) or (ii) prior to which
no Triggering Event has occurred, (i) such payment shall be made only if (A)
following the date of this Agreement


                                       44
<PAGE>

and prior to the termination of this Agreement, any Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly known, and (B) within
12 months following the termination of this Agreement, either a Company
Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated, or Company enters into an
agreement providing for a Company Acquisition and such Company Acquisition is
later consummated, and (ii) such payment shall be made promptly, but in any
event no later than two days after the consummation of such Company Acquisition.
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant
to this Section 8.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a
claim that results in a judgment against Company, Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.3(b) at the prime rate Bank of America N.T. and S.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Parent agrees that
the payment provided for in this Section 8.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon termination of this Agreement where such
fee has been paid, and such remedies shall be limited to the sum stipulated in
this Section 8.3(b), regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve the Company
from liability for the willful breach of, or fraud in connection with, any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

         For the purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY ACQUISITION" shall mean
any of the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement): (i) a sale or other disposition by Company of a business or
assets representing 40% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
assets of Company immediately prior to such sale; (ii) the acquisition by any

involving Company (other than a transaction in which Company is the Parent and
in which the current Company stockholders retain more than 60%, directly or

interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the

                                     ANNEX A

         Certain Conditions of the Offer. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of the Offer, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the Parent's rights
to extend and amend the Offer at any time in its sole discretion (subject to the
provisions of the Agreement), the Parent shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the Parent's
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of
or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any tendered
Shares, and may terminate or amend the Offer as to any Shares not then paid for,
if (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any Foreign Filing has
not expired or terminated, (ii) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, or
(iii) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the time of
acceptance for payment for any such Shares, any of the following events shall
occur or shall be determined by the Parent to have occurred:

         (a) there shall be threatened or pending any suit, action or proceeding
by any Governmental Entity against the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company (i) seeking to prohibit or impose any material
limitations on Parent's or Merger Sub ownership or operation (or that of any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or a material portion of
their or the Company's businesses or assets, or to compel Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective subsidiaries and affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent and their
respective subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, (ii) challenging the
acquisition by Parent or Merger Sub of any Shares under the Offer or pursuant to
the Stockholder Agreements, seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the performance of any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Tender and Voting
Agreements (including the voting provisions thereunder), or seeking to obtain
from the Company, Merger Sub or the Parent any damages that are material in
relation to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) seeking to
impose material limitations on the ability of Merger Sub, or render Merger Sub
unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase some or all of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger or (iv) seeking to impose material
limitations on the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub effectively to exercise
full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without limitation, the
right, to vote the Shares purchased by it on all matters properly presented to
the Company's stockholders;

         (b) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, or deemed applicable,
pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government
Entity, to the Offer or the Merger, or any other action shall be taken by any
Governmental Entity, other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, that is reasonably likely to
result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) of paragraph (a) above;


                                      A-1

<PAGE>


         (c) there shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of trading in,
or limitation on prices for, securities on the NYSE or in the Nasdaq, for a
period in excess of 24 hours (excluding suspensions or limitations resulting
solely from physical damage or interference with such exchanges not related to
market conditions), (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension
of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory),
(iii) a declaration of war by the United States or (iv) in the case of any of
the foregoing existing at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a material
acceleration or worsening thereof; (d) there shall have occurred and be
continuing any Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company; (e) a
Triggering Event; (f) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or as of the date
of this Agreement or as of the scheduled expiration of the Offer, to an extent
that would entitle Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iv)(A) (disregarding for this purpose the notice and cure provisions
thereof); (g) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect
any material obligation or to comply in any material respect with any material
agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement; or (h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms which in the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent
or Merger Sub, in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub) giving rise to such condition
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for
payment of or payment for Shares.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger
Sub and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                       FORM OF TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT

         TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of November
24, 2000, by and among Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Tahoe Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each of the individuals listed on the
Signature Pages hereto (each in his individual capacity, a "Stockholder", and
collectively, the "Stockholders").

         WHEREAS, each of the Stockholders is, as of the date hereof, the record
and beneficial owner of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the "Common Stock"), of Objective Systems Integrators, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), set forth on Annex I hereto;

         WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company concurrently herewith are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement), which provides, among
other things, for the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a cash
tender offer (the "Offer") by Purchaser for all of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and for the subsequent merger (the "Merger") of Purchaser with and
into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to
enter into the Merger Agreement, and in order to induce Parent and Purchaser to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders have agreed to enter into this
Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the execution and delivery by
Parent and Purchaser of the Merger Agreement and the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and
therein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder.
Stockholder (i) is the beneficial owner of the shares of Company Common Stock
and the options and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, if any, of the
Company indicated on the final page of this Agreement, free and clear of any
liens, claims, options, rights of first refusal, co-sale rights, charges or
other encumbrances that, in each case, would deprive Parent of the benefits of
this Agreement; (ii) does not beneficially own any securities of the Company
other than the shares of Company Common Stock and options and warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company indicated on the final page of
this Agreement; and (iii) has full power and authority to make, enter into and
carry out the terms of this Agreement and the proxy contained herein.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2. Purchase and Sale of the Shares. Each of the Stockholders
hereby agrees that he shall tender his Shares into the Offer promptly, and in
any event no later than the tenth business day following the commencement of the
Offer pursuant to Section 1.1 of the Merger Agreement, and that such Stockholder
shall not withdraw any Shares so tendered unless (i) the Offer is terminated or
has expired or (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof.
Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase all the Shares so tendered at a price per
Share equal to $17.75 per Share or any higher price that may be paid in the
Offer; provided, however, that Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment and
pay for the Shares in the Offer is subject to all the terms and conditions of
the Offer set forth in the Merger Agreement and Annex A thereto.

         SECTION 3. Transfer of the Shares. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein, none of the Stockholders shall:
(i) transfer (which term shall include, without limitation, for the purposes of
this Agreement, any sale, gift, pledge or other disposition), or consent to any
transfer of, any or all of the Shares; (ii) enter into any contract, option or
other agreement or understanding with respect to any transfer of any or all of
the Shares or any interest therein; (iii) grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or
other authorization or consent in or with respect to the Shares; (iv) deposit
the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement
with respect to the Shares; or (v) take any other action that would in any way
restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of such Stockholder's
obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Stockholder may transfer his Shares to the Stockholder's
spouse, ancestors, descendants or a trust for any of their benefit; provided,
however, that in any such case, each person to which any of such Shares or any
interest in any of such Shares is or may be transferred shall have (a) executed
a counterpart to this Tender and Voting Agreement and (b) agreed to hold such
Shares or interest in such Shares subject to all of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.

         SECTION 4. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.

         (a) Subject to Section 8 hereof, each of the Stockholders hereby
irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent and any nominee thereof, its proxy
and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name,
place, and stead of such Stockholder, to vote his Shares, or grant a consent or
approval in respect of his Shares, in connection with any meeting of the
Stockholders of the Company (i) in favor of the Merger, and (ii) against any
action or agreement which would impede, interfere with or prevent the Merger,
including any Acquisition Proposal. This Agreement is intended to bind
Stockholder as a stockholder of Company only with respect to the specific
matters set forth herein.

         (b) Each of the Stockholders represents that any proxies heretofore
given in respect of the Shares are not irrevocable, and that such proxies are
hereby revoked.

         (c) Subject to Section 8 hereof, each of the Stockholders hereby
affirms that the proxy set forth in this Section 4 is irrevocable and is given
in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such
irrevocable proxy is given to secure

<PAGE>

the performances of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each
Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy granted hereby is
coupled with an interest in the Shares and, except as set forth in Section 8
hereof, is intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of
Section 212(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

         SECTION 5. Certain Events. In the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the
capital structure of the Company affecting the Common Stock or the acquisition
of additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights of the
Company by any Stockholder, the number of Shares shall be adjusted
appropriately, and this Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall
attach to any additional shares of Common Stock or other securities or rights of
the Company issued to or acquired by any such Stockholder.

         SECTION 6. Certain Other Agreements. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or termination of the Merger Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII thereof, no Stockholder will, nor will any Stockholder
authorize or permit any of such Stockholder's affiliates or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information
with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document
or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to

         SECTION 7. Further Assurances. Each of the Stockholders shall, upon
request of Parent or Purchaser, execute and deliver any additional documents and
take such further actions as may reasonably be deemed by Parent or Purchaser to
be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and to vest in
