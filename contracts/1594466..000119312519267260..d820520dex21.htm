virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which

6

    

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ , each share of
Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares and Non-Cancelled Shares, but
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Converted PSUs, the "
_Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent
that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this
Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.447.

 

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to
exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration
(including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) and (B) any
dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_,

the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall remain
outstanding with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to preserve the
relative percentage interest in the Company represented by such shares
(collectively, the " _Non-Cancelled Shares_").

 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ In the event of any change in (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
(including options to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock), in each case
issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any
action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by,
the terms of this Agreement.

3.2 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_. 

(a) _Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
RSU (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or any holder thereof, be assumed by
Parent and remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable

award with respect to a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company RSU and (y) the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share of Parent Class A Common Stock). The shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock subject to a Converted RSU will be delivered to the holder thereof in
accordance with the terms of the Company RSU.

 

(b) _Company PSUs_. Each Company PSU (whether vested or unvested) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time automatically, and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company
or any holder thereof, be cancelled and converted (a " _Converted PSU_ ") into
a vested right to receive the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU that are earned based on actual achievement of the
performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement (as
reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board after
consultation with Parent), measured based on a truncated performance period
that ends immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock). The
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to a Converted PSU will be
delivered to the holder thereof in accordance with the terms of the Company
PSU. The Company Board shall provide Parent with an estimate of the number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that will be subject to the Converted
PSUs under this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ at least three Business Days prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the compensation
committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt such
resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company
RSUs and the Company PSUs pursuant to the terms of this  _Section_ __ _
3.2_, (ii) if requested by Parent in writing, cause the Company Equity Plan to
terminate at or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) take all actions
reasonably required to effectuate any provision of this  _Section_ __ _

Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of
Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of any equity awards of the Company, including
any Company RSUs or Company PSUs; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ shall prohibit the settlement of an award of
Company PSUs or Converted PSUs after the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of
such award.

3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent, or another
firm reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, to act as agent for the
holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration (including cash sufficient
to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_)
to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.
On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the

_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in
exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and _Sections
3.3(g)_  and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Class A Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_." Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash
portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in
the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the
aggregate cash payments contemplated by this _Article III_ , Parent shall
promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as
to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash
payments contemplated by this _ Article III_. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(g)_.

(iii) _DTC Book-Entry Shares_. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held
through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures
with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after

its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures, the
Merger Consideration (including cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _

other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant
to this _Article III_.

(iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for
Eligible Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration

the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
(including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) and dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ to a Person other than the registered holder of

Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not

whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books
of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(v)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g) _payable in respect

closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to

fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent

11

    

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock
for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately
prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration (including any cash
to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) and dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate.

 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Class_ __
_ A Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that such
holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock, all whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock were
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



12

    

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Class_ __ _ A Common Stock_. No
certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class
A Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Class A Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted
average price of Parent Class A Common Stock for the five consecutive trading
days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so
notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub and the Exchange Agent
and each of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts
are so properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing
Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect
to which such amounts would have been paid absent such deduction or
withholding.

 

3.4 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Transactions.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with
or furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since December 31, 2017 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth or
referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each case,
to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive,
non-specific or forward-looking in nature (but, for clarity, including any
historical factual information contained within such headings, disclosure or
statements)), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case of the
Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to have
such power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ ").
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so
qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of each
Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a "significant subsidiary" of the
Company within the meaning of Item 601(b)(21)(ii) of Regulation S-K (the "
_Company Significant Subsidiaries_ "), each as amended prior to the execution
of this Agreement, and each as made available to Parent is in full force and
effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of any of the provisions of such Organizational Documents.

 

4.2 _Capital Structure_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company
Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company
Capital Stock_ "). At the close of business on October 11, 2019 (the "
_Measurement Date_ "): (A) 213,404,153 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding; (B) 1,684,659 Company RSUs were issued and outstanding and
1,213,728 Company PSUs were issued and outstanding at target performance
levels; and (C) 17,747,482 shares of Company Common Stock remained available
for issuance pursuant to the Company Equity Plan.

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been
duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are
not subject to preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock have been issued and granted in compliance in all material respects
with (i) applicable securities Laws and other applicable Law and (ii) all
requirements set forth in applicable contracts. As of the close of business on
the Measurement Date, except as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ and
in the Designated Stockholder Voting Agreements and the Company Stockholders
Agreement, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to
subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries any capital stock of the Company or securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company (and the
exercise, conversion, purchase, exchange or other similar price thereof).
All outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Subsidiaries of the Company are owned by the Company, or a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, are free and clear of all

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and except
as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents (including all exhibits and schedules
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with or
furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since December 31, 2017 and prior
to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth or
referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each case,
to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive,
non-specific or forward-looking in nature (but, for clarity, including any
historical factual information contained within such headings, disclosure or
statements)), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 

5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case of
Parents Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to have such
power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so
qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has heretofore made available to the Company complete
and correct copies of its Organizational Documents, each as amended prior to
the execution of this Agreement, and each as made available to Parent is in
full force and effect, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any of the provisions of such Organizational Documents.

required to be made in the Joint Proxy Statement by applicable U.S. federal

set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_;

 

(ii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company and its Representatives may engage in the activities

favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Company Board or any
committee thereof in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel (
_provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement does not contain
provisions that prohibits the Company from complying with the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_), (B) that any such non-public information has

prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal is,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, and
(D) prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 



63

    

(iii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Company Competing Proposal from
a third party and did not arise from a breach of the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, if the Company Board or any committee thereof so
chooses, the Company Board or any committee thereof may effect a Company
Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such a Company Change

after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Company Competing Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal;

(C) the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed action and
the basis therefore four Business Days in advance, which notice shall set

financing documents;

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company Change of
Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board or
a committee thereof not to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in
response thereto; and

 

(E) at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board or a committee
thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by
Parent in response to the notice, and determines in good faith (1) after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Company Competing Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal and
(2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Superior
Proposal would

 



64

    

 be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the
event of any material amendment or material modification to any Company
Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment or modification to
the economic terms of any such Company Superior Proposal shall be deemed
material), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _

Approval, in response to a Company Intervening Event that occurs or arises
after the date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in connection
with a breach of this Agreement by the Company, the Company may, if the
Company Board or a committee thereof so chooses, effect a Company Change of
Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such a Company Change of
Recommendation may not be made unless and until:

 

(A) the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel
that a Company Intervening Event has occurred;

 

(B) the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith,

Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

(C) the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed action and
the basis therefore four Business Days in advance, which notice shall set
forth in writing that the Company Board or a committee thereof intends to
consider whether to take such action and includes a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening Event;

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company Change of
Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and

 



65

    

(E) at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board or a committee
thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by
Parent in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the
event of any material changes regarding any Company Intervening Event, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(iv)_ with respect
to such new written notice, except that the advance written notice obligation
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(iv)_ shall be reduced to two
Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such new written notice shall
in no event shorten the original four Business Day notice period.

 

(f) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company
shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, prior
to, but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if,
in response to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any
"standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar
provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a
Company Competing Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board or a
committee thereof and communicate such waiver to the applicable third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall advise Parent at least two
Business Days prior to taking such action. The Company represents and warrants
to Parent that it has not taken any action that (i) would be prohibited by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ or (ii) but for the ability to avoid actions
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, would have been prohibited
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ during the 30 days prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by the
Company.

Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders on or prior to the

Stockholders Meeting (or promptly after commencement of such tender offer or
exchange offer if commenced on or after the third Business Day prior to the
date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting) or (B) ten Business Days (as such
term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) after commencement of such

, a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,

 

(i) Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, make such disclosures as the
Parent Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith are necessary
to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or other disclosure required to be made in the Joint Proxy Statement by
applicable U.S. federal securities Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if

this Agreement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_;

(ii) prior to, but not after, receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval,
in response to a Parent Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date
of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in connection with a breach
of this Agreement by Parent, Parent may, if the Parent Board or a committee
thereof so chooses, effect a Parent Change of Recommendation; provided,
however, that such a Parent Change of Recommendation may not be made unless
and until:

 

(A) the Parent Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a
Parent Intervening Event has occurred;

(B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;

(C) Parent provides the Company written notice of such proposed action and
the basis therefore four Business Days in advance, which notice shall set
forth in writing that the Parent Board or a committee thereof intends to
consider whether to take such action and includes a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances of the Parent Intervening Event;

 



69

    

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent Change of
Recommendation, Parent negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Parent Board not to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response
thereto; and

 

(E) at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Parent Board or a committee
thereof takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company in writing and any other information offered
by the Company in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response to such Parent
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that in the event of any material changes regarding any Parent Intervening
Event, Parent shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
the Company and to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
6.4(e)(ii)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance
written notice obligation set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)(ii)_

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of
its capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the adoption
by its stockholders of this Agreement. The Company will promptly furnish to
Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the
holders of its capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.

 



70

    

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in preparing and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement
relating to matters submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the
Company Stockholders Meeting and matters submitted to holders of Parent
Capital Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the Registration
Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company
and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the
Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably practicable and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and
Parent will advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for
additional information and Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare any
response to such comments or requests, and each of Parent and the Company
agrees to permit the other (in each case, to the extent practicable), and
their respective counsels, to participate in all meetings and conferences with
the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the
Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and
Parent will (A) provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of
such document or response), (B) include in such document or response all
comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other and (C) not file or
mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of
the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect
to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each Party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Class A Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each
of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any

 



71

    

 material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders
of Parent.

6.6 _Stockholders_ _Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement
by the SEC and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC
(and in any event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting
within 45 days thereof). Except as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve and
adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board
shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the
Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or (B) if, as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than 15 Business Days after the date for which the
meeting was previously scheduled ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that such Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and  _(i)(B)_
exist, and such Company Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed
every time the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist);
and _provided_ _further_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the

tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting that have
been prepared by the Company or the Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor
or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written
communications from or to the Companys stockholders with respect thereto.
Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Companys
stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Stockholder Approval
from

 



72

    

 being obtained. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with
a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. Without the prior written
consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not call
any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC
and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in any
event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within 45 days
thereof). Except as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Parent Board
shall recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the Parent Stock
Issuance and the Parent Board shall solicit from stockholders of Parent
proxies in favor of the Parent Stock Issuance, and the Joint Proxy Statement
shall include the Parent Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn
or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement is provided to the Parents stockholders or (B) if, as of the time
for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Class B Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii)
may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time
for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than 15 Business Days after the date for which the
meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and  _(i)(B)_
exist, and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed
every time the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist);
and _provided_ _further_ that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the

tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that have been
prepared by Parent or Parents transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other
Representative, and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed
regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written
communications from or to Parents stockholders with respect thereto. Unless
there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 6.4_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Parents stockholders or
any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval from being

 



73

    

 obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law
or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement
or adjournment permitted hereunder.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
set the record dates for and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day and at
approximately the same time.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each of the Company
and Parent agrees that its obligations to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable, pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be affected by
the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of
Recommendation, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.6_ shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement,
disclosure, or communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any
Company Competing Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal
(including, with respect to the Company, a Company Superior Proposal) or the
occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event or Parent
Intervening Event.

 

(e) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly
approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents
of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

6.7 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 6.7_, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. Each Party shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other Party and its
Representatives, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _
8.1_ of this Agreement, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable
prior notice, to the officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of such Party and its Subsidiaries and to their books,
records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party and its
Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably
requested, from time to

 



74

    

 time, by or on behalf of the other Party. Each Party and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the other Party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by the employees of the other Party and its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i) No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to,
grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any
of its Representatives to the extent that such information is regarding the
value of the transaction or is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such
information, as applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing
contract or agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is
being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does
not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use
of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or
waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B)
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure
of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection,
including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or
entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information
to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably
permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege);

 

(ii) No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information that in the other Partys good
faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of
its Subsidiaries to risk of liability; 

(iii) Each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any invasive or
intrusive sampling or analysis (commonly known as a Phase II) of any
environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which may be granted or withheld in such other Partys sole discretion); and

(iv) No investigation or information provided pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 6.7_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein and no Party shall, and each
Party shall cause their respective Representatives to not, use
any information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ for any
purpose unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the
Transactions.

 



75

    

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of September 3, 2019 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any Party or
its Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed
to be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ ,
each Party shall continue to provide access to the other Party and its
Representatives to the electronic data room relating to the Transactions
maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and its
Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust
Laws to which _Sections 6.8(b)_ and _6.8(c)_ , and not this _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities and other third parties all authorizations, consents, notifications,
certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in
order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any
consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any
such Persons authorization, approval, consent or waiver to effectuate the
Transactions, other than filing, recordation or similar fees. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions (including the Joint Proxy Statement). The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or
conditions with respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits, expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with
the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, may be withheld in Parents sole
discretion).

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than 15 Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings required under the HSR Act.
Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any
filings and in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, orders, expirations, terminations, waivers, or approvals
under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,
including requesting early termination of the HSR Act waiting period. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly make an
appropriate response to any request for information from any

 Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or
investigating the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of mergers,
monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a dominant position
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the
United States, the European Commission or any other competition authority of
any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Parent and the Company shall
keep each other apprised of the status of any material communications with,
and any inquiries or requests for additional information from any Antitrust
Authority. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take
any and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations
of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating
any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the
entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with
any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the
case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its
or their businesses or assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action
may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of
the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental
Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction
(preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Merger, fails to do so by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, none of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take any
Divestiture Action or other action that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. In the
event that any action challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust
Law is threatened or instituted, Parent shall take such action, including any
Divestiture Action except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action. Parent shall
be entitled to direct any Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority or other
Person relating to any of the foregoing, _provided_ , _however_ , that it
shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. The
Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.8(b)_ so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably
be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the obtaining of
clearance or the expiration or termination of the required waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
until the termination of employment of the relevant employee), Parent shall
cause each employee who is employed as of the Closing Date by the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ") and who remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation, LLC
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries) on the Closing Date (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") to be provided with (i) annual base salary or base wage rate that
is no less favorable than the annual salary or base wage rate in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date hereof, (ii) a target
annual cash incentive opportunity that is no less favorable than the target
annual cash incentive opportunity provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and (iii) employee
benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred
compensation, equity or equity-based, or post-termination or retiree health
or welfare benefits) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to
those (excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation,
equity or equity-based, or post-termination or retiree health or welfare
benefits) in effect for either (i) such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the date hereof through the Company Plans, or (ii) similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Continuing
Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual under the
Parent Plans (other than for any purposes with respect to any equity or
equity-based benefits, "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, disability benefits, retiree medical benefits or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits or duplicate compensation for the same
period of service) in which the Continuing Employees participate, for such
Continuing Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into
account under a corresponding Company Plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(c) In the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any
limitation on health coverage of any Continuing Employee and his or her
covered, eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting
periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of
good health under the applicable Parent Plan to the extent such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered, eligible dependents are covered under an
analogous Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such
conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company
Plan and (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket limits for medical expenses incurred and contributions to flexible
spending accounts prior to the Closing Date for which payments have been made,
in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan
provider and only to the extent such deductibles or limits for medical
expenses were satisfied or did not apply under the analogous Company Plan in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



78

    

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, to assume
and honor their respective obligations under all employment, severance, change
in control and other agreements, if any, between the Company (or a Subsidiary
thereof) and an individual employed prior to the Closing Date by the Company
or a Subsidiary thereof.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, if requested by Parent in writing, the
Company shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all necessary
and appropriate actions to cause each Company Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Company _ _401(k)_ __ _ Plan_") to
be terminated effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action may be contingent upon
Closing. The Company shall provide Parent with an advance copy of all
documentation necessary to effect this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ and a
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to the adoption or execution
thereof. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any and all action
as may be reasonably required, including amendments to a defined contribution
retirement plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
designated by Parent (the " _Parent _ _401(k)_ __ _ Plan_") to (i) cause the
Parent 401(k) Plan to accept any "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash in an amount
equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan and
(ii) cause each Continuing Employee to become a participant in the
Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.9(b)_).

 

(f) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, Parent, LLC Sub, the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and other paid
time off days accrued or earned by such Company Employee as of the Closing
Date for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 6.9 is intended to (a) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or any of their Affiliates (i) from
establishing, amending or terminating any of their respective Employee Benefit
Plans or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, contract,
agreement or arrangement or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan or
(ii) from terminating the employment or service of any Person, including a
Continuing Employee, at any time and for any reason or (b) provide any Person
any right to employment or service or continued employment or service with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and following the consummation of the LLC Sub Merger,
LLC Sub) or any particular term or condition of employment or service.

 



79

    

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment or
termination of, or an amendment to, or be construed as establishing,
terminating or amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Company Employee, Continuing Employee or other current or
former employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party
beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with
respect to the matters provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_) under or by
reason of any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

 

6.10 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on
the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as
a fiduciary under any Company Plan, in each case, when acting in such
capacity (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys and
other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened
or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is
otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a
fiduciary under any Company Plan or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as
applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any
such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing
prior to, at, or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "),
including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final
disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any
Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Persons may retain the Companys regularly engaged legal
counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and
(ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to assist
in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim
indemnification or

 



80

    

 advancement of expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, upon learning of
any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure
so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such Partys position with respect to such claims). With respect to
any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _
6.10_, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the
DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special, independent
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services
for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last
three years.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or
manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in
a manner that would) adversely the rights thereunder or under the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill
and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors,
officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon
request as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, relating to the enforcement
of such Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ or under
any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person
is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or
thereunder.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place,
and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six
years from the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
(" _D andO Insurance_") in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at, prior to, or after the Effective Time; _provided_
,  _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance
exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium
paid by the Company for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 



81

    

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assignees (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer,
distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render Parent or Surviving Corporation unable to
satisfy their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or
insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10_, and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are in addition to any rights such
Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

6.11 _Transaction_ _Litigation_. Except for any Proceeding taken by any
Antitrust Authority which shall be subject to Sections 6.8(b) and 6.8(c), in
the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
threatened, that questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or
seeks damages in connection therewith, including stockholder litigation ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
promptly notify the other Party of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep
the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Each
Party shall give the other Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consider in
good faith the other Partys advice with respect to such Transaction
Litigation; _provided_ that the Party that is subject to such Transaction
Litigation shall not offer or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the Parties. No Party shall, and each will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior
written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party,
its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or
other public disclosures (a) required by applicable Law, (b) required by the
rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or its Subsidiarys
capital stock is traded or (c) consistent with the final form of the joint
press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation given to
investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger; _provided_ , in each
case, such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other Party an
opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comments thereon; and _provided_ , _however_ , that no
provision this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner a Partys
ability to communicate with its employees and that neither Party 

 



82

    

 shall be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or
obtain any approval from any other Party with respect to a public announcement
or press release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Competing Proposal or a Parent Competing Proposal, as applicable, and
matters related thereto or a Company Change of Recommendation or Parent Change
of Recommendation, as applicable, other than as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, as applicable.

 

6.13 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to
compliance with applicable Law, the Company and Parent, as the case may be,
shall confer on a regular basis with each other and shall promptly advise each
other orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.
Except with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, the
Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their respective
counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party or its Subsidiaries with the
SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Without limiting in any way any Partys rights or obligations
under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any
Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party
and their respective Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
3.3(b)_, all Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the Merger or the
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger shall be
borne by the Surviving Corporation. The Parties will cooperate, in good faith,
in the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and the
minimization, to the extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law, of
the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

 

6.15 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. Except to the extent that
the Parties obligations are specifically set forth elsewhere in this
_Article VI_:

(a) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.3_), each of the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Party in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger
and the other Transactions; and

 

(b) subject to applicable Law and as otherwise required by any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the consummation of the Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by Parent or the Company, as applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries,
from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions (including those alleging that the approval or consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions).

 



83

    

6.16 _Derivative Contracts_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Parent, its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives in the amendment or novation of any Derivative Transaction of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, on terms that are
reasonably requested by Parent and effective at and conditioned upon the
Closing.

 

6.17 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
Parent (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to
such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

6.18 _Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause the Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten
days after the Effective Time. If the Surviving Corporation is required to
file any quarterly or annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act by a filing
deadline that is imposed by the Exchange Act and which falls on a date within
the 15 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall make available to
Parent, at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a substantially
final draft of any such annual or quarterly report reasonably likely to be
required to be filed during such period. 

6.19 _Prepayment of_ _Company Credit Facility_. Not less than three
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent from the
administrative agent under the Company Credit Facility, a copy of a payoff
letter in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, setting forth the total
amounts payable pursuant to the Company Credit Facility to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, Debt Prepayment Expenses, and all fees, costs and
expenses as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily
accrual thereafter), together with appropriate wire instructions, and the
agreement from the administrative agent under the Company Credit Facility that
upon payment in full of all such amounts owed to such holder the loan
documents shall be terminated with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors thereof (or the assets or equity
of which secure such Indebtedness) and such holder shall release and terminate
all Liens on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets and
equity securing the Company Credit Facility (the " _Payoff Letters_ "),
together with any applicable documents necessary to evidence the release and
termination of all Liens on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective assets and equity securing, and any guarantees by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in respect of, such Company Credit Facility.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Integrated Mergers, taken together, to qualify, and will not take
(and will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such
Party from taking) any actions that could reasonably be expected to prevent
the Integrated Mergers from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company will
comply, to the extent reasonably expected to be necessary to cause the
Integrated Mergers, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, with all representations,
warranties, and covenants contained in the Parent Tax Certificate and the

appropriate to enable such counsel to render the opinion described in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d), as applicable _(the "
_Parent Tax Certificate_ ") and (ii) the Company shall deliver to each such
counsel a duly executed certificate containing such representations,
warranties and covenants as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to

Certificate_ "), in each case dated as of the Closing Date (and,
if requested, dated as of the date on which the Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC), and Parent and the Company shall provide such
other information as reasonably requested by each counsel for purposes of
rendering the opinions described in Section 7.2(d) and _Section_ __ _
7.3(d)_.

the meaning of Treasury Regulations §§ 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

6.21 _Takeover Laws_. None of the Parties will take any action that would
cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover
Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from the
Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the

 speak as of a specified date or period of time shall have been true and
correct in all material respects only as of such date or period of time), and

referred to in such opinion, the Integrated Mergers, taken together, will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In rendering the opinion described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_,

Agreement.

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice
of said independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the Parties
shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be construed
against any Party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of
Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty, or as an exception to _Section_ __
_ 6.1_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties, or all
other subclauses of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties,
or to such other subclauses of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2_,
is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the presence or absence
of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or warranties or
an appropriate cross reference thereto. 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the Parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless

 



94

    

 expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the
language contained therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited.
The words "this Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import,
refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur.
The word "including" (in its various forms) means "including, without
limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be
construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles
(including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly
requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained
herein shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive and
disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas
time. The word "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The term "dollars" and the symbol "$"
mean United States Dollars. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions
hereof.

(e) In this Agreement, except as the context may otherwise require,
references to: (i) any agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute
or regulation are to the agreement, contract, statute or regulation as
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time
(in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the
terms thereof and, if applicable, by the terms of this Agreement); any
Governmental Entity include any successor to that Governmental Entity; (ii)
any applicable Law refers to such applicable Law as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes,

operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage,

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
Parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, this

terms of this Agreement at Law or in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees (a)
the non-breaching Party will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable
relief, without proof of actual damages; and (b) the alleged breaching Party
will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and

 



98

    

 obligations of such Party under this Agreement and will not plead in defense
thereto that there are adequate remedies at Law, all in accordance with the
terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_. Each Party further agrees that no other
Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If prior to the Outside
Date, any Party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by such other time period established by
the court presiding over such action. 

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law
would require the further approval by such stockholders without first
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

9.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent may, to the extent legally allowed:

of the other Party hereunder;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
Party contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by any of the parties hereto
of any default, misrepresentation or breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not,
shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue
of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

9.14 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement

named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future
director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,

 more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of Parent, Company or the Merger
Sub under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) or of or
