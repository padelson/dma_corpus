Closing Claim Date, or to contain the information required by item nos. (i)
through (v) of this Section 3.2(a), shall render such notice ineffective, and
for the purposes of this Article 3, shall be treated as if it had never been
served.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 7.1(e), within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of an
Environmental Defect Notice, and subject to Section 3.2(c) below and the
reservation of all rights to contest any aspect of any such Environmental
Defect Notice under Section 3.2(g), Seller shall, in its sole discretion, by
notice to Purchaser elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing by an amount agreed upon
in writing by Purchaser and Seller as being the amount of the Lowest Cost
Response to Remediate each such Environmental Defect; or

 



 

(ii) only if the value of the Environmental Defect asserted by Purchaser in
the Environmental Defect Notice exceeds the Allocated Value for the affected
Environmental Defect Property, retain the Property that is affected by such
Environmental Defect, in which event the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property and shall be reflected in the Preliminary
Accounting Statement in accordance with Sections 5.3(c) and 8.1, and such
Environmental Defect Property shall no longer be included within the
definition of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement other than Section
5.4; or

 



 

(iii) perform or cause to be performed prior to the Remedy Deadline, at the
sole cost and expense of Seller, such operations as may be necessary to
remediate the

 



      
 

 



 

Environmental Defect by (i) bringing such affected Property into compliance
with the applicable Environmental Law and (ii) correcting the condition that
causes the affected Property to be subject to an obligation to perform
remedial action under Environmental Law (subparts (i) and (ii) are
collectively referred to as " _Remediation_ " or " _Remediate_ "). Failing
such Remediation of the Environmental Defect, the Environmental Defect
Property will be excluded from the Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price
will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property.
Prior to the Remedy Deadline and upon Sellers Remediation of the
Environmental Defect, the Purchaser will acquire the affected Property from
Seller and pay the Allocated Value for the Environmental Defect property,
adjusted in accordance with Sections 5.3(c) and 8.1, in accordance with
Section 5.4. If Seller is unable to Remediate the Environmental Defect prior
to the end of the Remedy Deadline, then such Property shall become an Excluded
Asset and no longer be considered as an Asset under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If Seller receives an Environmental Defect Notice and Seller disagrees
with the existence or extent of any of the Environmental Defects alleged in an
Environmental Defect Notice, and the Parties cannot agree on the existence or
extent prior to the Closing Date: (a) the Seller shall submit the dispute to
arbitration pursuant to Section 3.2(g); and (b) while awaiting the outcome
from such arbitration, the Environmental Defect Property shall be retained by
the Seller and in which event the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental
Defect Property and shall be reflected in the Preliminary Accounting Statement
in accordance with Sections 5.3(c) and 8.1 pending the outcome of the
arbitration pursuant to Section 3.2(g) at which point Section 3.2(g)(viii)(A)
and Section 5.4 shall apply.

 



 

(d) If Seller elects to proceed under Section 3.2(b)(i) and Purchaser and
Seller have failed by Closing to agree on the reduction to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, the Parties shall: (a) submit the dispute to arbitration
pursuant to Section 3.2(g); and (b) while awaiting the outcome from such
arbitration, remove such affected Property from the Assets at Closing and
proceed with Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value for the affected Property pending the outcome of the
arbitration pursuant to Section 3.2(g).

 



 

(e) Subject to Section 6.1(q) and Sellers Retained Obligations in relation to
offsite disposal of hazardous substances (and right to indemnification for
such Retained Obligations under Article 11), this Article 3 shall be the
exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to Environmental Defects
or any other matter or liability related to Environmental Laws or the
environmental condition of the Properties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if prior to the Pre-Closing Claim Date Purchaser
identifies an Environmental Defect which could also result in the breach of
any warranty other than Section 6.1(q), then Purchaser shall only be entitled
to assert such matter as an Environmental Defect to the extent permitted by
this Section 3.2 and shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the
basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty. For clarity, after
the Pre-Closing Claim Date, Purchaser shall not have the right to assert any
claims for Environmental Defects (other than those that are the subject of an
Environmental Defect Notice submitted before the Pre-Closing Date) provided
that the Purchasers rights under this Agreement relating to a breach of the
Sellers warranty in Section 6.1(q) shall not be affected.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The " _Environmental Defect Amount_ " resulting from an Environmental
Defect shall be the amount determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall be based upon applicable
Environmental Law in effect at the Effective Time; and

 



 

(iii) the estimated costs of Remediation shall not exceed the estimated costs
of complying with the requirements of Governmental Authorities and
Environmental Law and to fully satisfy all claims, fines and penalties that
may be imposed by, or asserted by, Governmental Authorities related thereto;
and

 



 

(iv) in addition, the estimated costs of Remediation shall be based upon and
not exceed the lowest estimated costs reasonably required to comply with the
requirements of Governmental Authorities and Environmental Law, and fully
satisfy all claims, fines and penalties that may be imposed by, or asserted
by, Governmental Authorities related thereto ("the _Lowest Cost Response_ ").

 



 

(g) If, prior to the date that is one hundred and ten (110) days after the
Closing (the " _Remedy Deadline_ "), there is a dispute as to whether
Remediation has occurred, or Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on the proper
and adequate Remediation for any such Environmental Defect, or if, Seller and
Purchaser cannot agree on (1) the Environmental Defect Amount, or (2) whether
the alleged Environmental Defect constitutes an Environmental Defect, such
dispute(s) (" _Disputed Environmental Matters_ ") shall be finally and
exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2(g);
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything stated in this Article 3 to
the contrary, Seller shall only be permitted to dispute after Closing the
matters described above to the extent that the affected Property was retained
by Seller at Closing pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii) or Section 3.2(b)(iii).
Sellers election to attempt Remediation shall be without prejudice to its
rights under this Section 3.2(g) and shall not constitute an admission against
interests or a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Environmental Defect.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall provide to Seller by no later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day following the Remedy Deadline an updated written description
meeting the requirements of Section 3.2(a), together with all supporting
documentation, of the Disputed Environmental Matters. By not later than ten
(10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description
of the Disputed Environmental Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a
written response setting forth such Sellers position with respect to the
Disputed Environmental Matters together with all supporting documentation.

 



 

(ii) By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of
Sellers written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed
Environmental Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration
of any such dispute(s) by written notice to Seller of any Disputed
Environmental Matters not otherwise resolved or waived (" _Final Disputed_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Environmental Matters_ ") that are to be resolved by arbitration (the "
_Environmental Arbitration Notice_ ").

 



 

(iii) The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "), determined as follows. The arbitrator selected
under this subparagraph shall be a licensed environmental engineer with at
least ten (10) years experience assessing the environmental condition of oil
and gas properties in Texas and not have been associated with or worked with
either Party in the past five (5) years. Within three (3) Business Days
following Sellers receipt of the Environmental Arbitration Notice, Seller and
Purchaser shall each exchange lists of three acceptable, qualified
arbitrators. Within three (3) Business Days following the exchange of lists of
acceptable arbitrators, Purchaser and Seller shall select by mutual agreement
one arbitrator from the combined lists. If no agreement is reached, Purchaser
and Seller shall each, by 5:00 pm Central Time of the second (2nd) Business
Day identify a single arbitrator from their original list of three acceptable
arbitrators. The two selected arbitrators shall then together agree on a third
arbitrator from the original lists within three Business Days following their
own selection by each Party, which shall be no more than seven (7) Business
Days following the Environmental Arbitration Notice. Such third arbitrator
shall serve as the Environmental Arbitrator.

 



 

(iv) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the
Environmental Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the
Environmental Arbitrator of (A) this Agreement, with specific reference to
this Section 3.2(g), (B) Purchasers written description of the Final Disputed
Environmental Matters together with the supporting documents that were
previously provided to Seller pursuant to Section 3.2(g)(i), (C) Sellers
written response to Purchasers written description of the Final Disputed
Environmental Matters, together with the supporting documents that were
previously provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.2(g)(i), and (D) the
Environmental Arbitration Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following such
submissions, each of the Parties may submit one written response to the other
Partys submission. The Environmental Arbitrator shall resolve the Final
Disputed Environmental Matters based only on the foregoing submissions.
Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional
documentation or any additional written response to the Environmental
Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the other Party.

 



 

(v) The Environmental Arbitrator shall make its determination by written
decision within thirty (30) Business Days following Sellers receipt of the
Environmental Arbitration Notice (the " _Environmental Arbitration Decision_
"). The Environmental Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section
3.2(f) and this Section 3.2(g). The Environmental Arbitrator may consult with
and engage disinterested third Persons, including counsel, to advise the
Environmental Arbitrator, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of
such consultants. Any such consultant shall not (i) be currently working as an
employee or consultant for either Party, nor be in discussions about potential
future work for either Party, (ii) have worked directly or indirectly as an
employee or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the two-year
period preceding the arbitration, or (iii) have any financial or other
personal interest in the dispute.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and
Environmental Defect Amounts and shall not be empowered to award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

 



 

(vii) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
preparing and presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by
the Environmental Arbitrator that are attributable to the consultation of any
third Person.

 



 

(viii) Seller and Purchaser shall implement the Environmental Arbitration
Decision as follows:

 



 

(A) in the case of alleged Environmental Defects determined to be
Environmental Defects, Seller shall elect the course of action set out in
Section 3.2(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) within ten (10) Business Days following
Sellers receipt of the Environmental Arbitration Decision; provided that if
Section 3.2(c) applies and the Seller pursues Section 3.2(b)(i) or (iii) to
implement the Environmental Arbitration Decision the Purchaser shall purchase
the Environmental Defect Property and Section 5.4 shall apply;

 



 

(B) in the case of disputed Environmental Defect Amounts, where Seller has
elected to reduce the Unadjusted Purchase Price in accordance with Section
3.2(b)(i), Seller shall adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price to give effect to
the Environmental Arbitration Decision. Any Environmental Arbitration Decision
shall be a final and binding decision as to that Disputed Environmental
Matter.

 



 

(ix) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 3.2
shall be decided by the Environmental Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of
the State of Texas. Any award of the Environmental Arbitrator may be enforced
against both Parties in the courts located in Harris County or Houston, Texas,
or any other state in which any Party holds or owns property of any kind.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any remedies available under this Article 3:

 



 

(i) for any Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an individual
Environmental Defect Property if such amount does not exceed fifty thousand
United States Dollars ($50,000), but if exceeded, the entire Environmental
Defect Amount related thereto shall be counted for purposes of this Agreement,
without deduction of this individual threshold (the " _Individual
Environmental Threshold_ "); and

 



 

(ii) unless the aggregate amount of all such Environmental Defect Amounts, (
_provided_ that each such Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold and excluding any Environmental Defect Amounts with
respect to Environmental Defects cured by Seller) exceeds the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible, after which point Purchaser, shall be

 



      
 

 



 

entitled to remedies elected by Seller in accordance with Section 3.2(b) only
to the extent that such Environmental Defects exceed the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible.

 



 

(i) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in Section 15.7, time is of the essence in performing their obligations and
exercising their rights under this Section 3.2, and, as such, that each and
every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the
firm and final date and time.

 



 

(j) If Seller pursues Remediation then Purchaser agrees that at Sellers
election, all negotiations and contacts with Governmental Authorities for
approval and review of such remedial action shall be made by Seller.

 



 

 **3.3** **SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS OF THE PURCHASER TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER
ARTICLE 11 WITH REGARD TO A BREACH OF SECTION 6.1(Q) OR SELLERS RETAINED
OBLIGATIONS (TO THE EXTENT RELATED TO SELLERS OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS
SUBSTANCES), THIS ARTICLE 3 SHALL CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS ENTIRE REMEDY WITH
RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.**

 



 

 **3.4** **EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 3.2 AND SECTION 6.1(Q) (AND ARTICLE
11 WITH REGARD TO A BREACH OF SECTION 6.1(Q)) AND EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO THE
SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE FROM SELLER IN THE ASSIGNMENT, PURCHASER SHALL
ACQUIRE THE PROPERTIES "WHERE IS" AND "AS IS" WITH NO RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY
FURTHER AMOUNTS FROM SELLER FOR ANY LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES RELATED TO
THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES). ACQUISITION OF THE PROPERTY
CONTAINING SUCH CONDITIONS "WHERE IS" AND "AS IS" SHALL CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS
WAIVER, GENERAL RELEASE AND AGREEMENT TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER AND
EACH MEMBER OF SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM ALL LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES
RELATED TO SUCH CONDITIONS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS, CERCLA LIABILITY AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES), WHETHER
CONTRACT, TORT OR STATUTORY, REGARDLESS OF THE PAST NEGLIGENCE, GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT OR STRICT OR STATUTORY LIABILITY OF SELLER OR ANY MEMBER
OF SELLER GROUP.**

4.1 **_Exclusive Title Remedy._**

 



 

Except with regard to the Sellers special warranty of title in the
Assignment, this Article 4 provides Purchasers exclusive remedy against
Seller with respect to any claim in connection with Sellers claim of title
relating to the Assets.

 



 

4.2 **_Definitions of Defensible Title, Title Defect and Title Benefit._**

 



 

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means such
title of the Seller as of the Pre-Closing Claim Date and as of Closing Date
that, except for and subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

 



 

(i) with respect to the Oil and Gas Interests, entitles the Seller to receive
not less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in _Exhibits A-1 and A-2_ for
such Oil and Gas Interests, throughout the productive life of such Wells and
throughout the term of such Mineral Interests, except (A) decreases in
connection with those operations in which Seller or its successors or assigns
may elect after the Execution Date to be a non-consenting co-owner, (B)
decreases resulting from reversion of interest to co-owners with respect to
operations approved after the Execution Date in which such co-owners elect not
to consent, (C) decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after
the Execution Date, of pools or units including, but not limited to allocation
and pooled units, (D) decreases required to allow other working interest
owners to make up either Imbalances identified in this Agreement or to make up
underproduction or pipeline imbalances that occur after Closing, (E) any other

Interest, or (D) as otherwise stated in _Exhibit A-2_;

 



 

(iii) with respect to the Mineral Interests, entitles Seller to receive not

with regard to elections made or breaches occurring after the Execution Date,
or (C) as otherwise stated in _Exhibit A-1_;

 



 

(iv) in the case of any Mineral Interest, entitles Seller to a primary term
under such Hydrocarbon lease or other Mineral Interest (if such Hydrocarbon

Interests to the extent specified in _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_, and
(ii) any lien or financial encumbrance on the Equipment, Field Pipelines and
Electrical Laterals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be

unavailability of information from Governmental Authorities; (B) references to
a document(s) if such document(s) is not in Sellers files; or (C) Tax
assessment, Tax payment or similar records (or the absence of such activities
or records);

 



 

(ii) defects arising out of variation of corporate name or lack of corporate
or other entity authorization, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence
that the action was not authorized and such lack of authorization results in a
third Persons actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Oil and Gas
Interest;

 



 

(iii) defects based on failure to record Mineral Interests granted by any
Governmental Authority, or any assignments of record title or operating rights
in such Mineral Interests, in the real property, conveyance or other records
of the county in which such Oil and Gas Interest is located;

 



 

(iv) defects based on a gap in Sellers chain of title in the county records
as to Oil and Gas Interests, where such a gap occurs in excess of twenty-five
(25) years prior to the effective date of said Oil and Gas Interests, and no
challenge of record can be demonstrated, whether by pending judicial, quiet
title action, or other filing of record in the county courthouse clearly
demonstrating that such a gap represents a competing chain of title;

 



 

(v) defects as a consequence of cessation of production, insufficient
production, failure to produce in paying quantities or failure to conduct
operations during any period after the completion of a well capable of
production in paying quantities on any of the Oil and Gas Interests held by
production, or lands pooled, communitized or unitized therewith, except to the
extent of a court ordered termination of the lease or affirmative release by
Seller of a lease will constitute a title defect if such interest is listed on
_Exhibit A-1_;

adverse possession, applicable laws of limitations or prescription or such
other matter that would render such defect invalid according to applicable
law;

 



 

(vii) defects in the chain of title or in the Oil and Gas Interest itself
consisting of the failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions
of successions of heirship or estate

 



       
 

 



 

proceedings, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such failure
or omission results in another persons superior claim of title to the
relevant Asset;

 



 

(viii) defects arising solely out of lack of survey or lack of metes and
bounds descriptions, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable Law;

 



 

(ix) defects arising from any change in applicable Law after the Execution
Date;

 



 

(x) defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to the Oil and Gas

_Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, and have been taken into
account in the Sellers Net Revenue Interests, Working Interests and Net
Mineral Acres reflected thereon;

 



 

(xiii) defects arising from shut-in wells that are operated under leases
containing habendum and/or shut-in clauses which permit the continuation of
such leases by payment of shut-in royalties, and Seller can provide evidence
that all such royalties have been properly paid;

 



 

(xiv) defects arising from the expiration of any oil and gas lease for any
Mineral Interests after the Execution Date to the extent such expiration date
was stated on _Exhibit A-1_.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to (i) increase the Net Revenue
Interest of Seller in any of the Oil and Gas Interests above that shown on

proportionate increase in Sellers Working Interest, as applicable, above that
shown on _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_; (ii) decrease the Working Interests
of Seller in any of the Wells below that shown on _Exhibit A-2_ without a
decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest, as applicable, below that shown on
_Exhibit A-2_, or (iii) increase the Sellers Net Mineral Acres above that
shown in _Exhibit A-1_ (but if the reason is due to an increase in Sellers
Working Interest, then such increase must be accompanied by not less than a
proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue Interest in the applicable
Mineral Interest) (each, an " _Additional Oil and Gas Interest_ ").

the drilling of any well, (iii) do not reduce the Sellers Net Mineral Acres
below that shown in _Exhibit A-1_, or (iv) do not reduce the Sellers Net
Revenue Interest below that shown in _Exhibit A-2_ or (v) increase the
Sellers Working Interest above that shown in _Exhibit A-2_ without a
proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest of such Seller, or (vi)
prevent or materially impair the current ownership or use of the Wells and
associated acreage and surface area, producing prior to the Effective Time, or
(vii) prevent or materially impair the ability to develop the undeveloped
lands covered by the Oil and Gas Interests to produce Hydrocarbons.

 



      
 

 



 

4.4 **_Notice of Title Defects._**

 



 

(a) If, as a consequence of its Pre-Acquisition Review, Purchaser desires to
assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices to
Seller (each a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") promptly after the discovery
thereof, but in no event later than the Pre-Closing Claim Date. To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect(s) reasonably sufficient for Seller
to determine the basis of the alleged Title Defect, (ii) identification of the
Oil and Gas Interest adversely affected by the Title Defect (each a " _Title
Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property,
(iv) all documents upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of a Title
Defect, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify
the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), provided that if such documents
are not in Purchasers possession, Purchaser may instead provide Seller with
sufficient detail as to why the Purchaser cannot use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain such documentation, where the documents are located (if
applicable) and/or how the Seller can obtain any necessary documents relied
on, but not in the Purchasers possession, and (v) the amount by which
Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the computations and information upon which
Purchasers belief is based, including any analysis by any title attorney or
examiner hired by Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Pre-Closing
Claim Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the
Pre-Closing Claim Date, deliver a notice to Seller in writing, which shall
include (i) a description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Oil and Gas Interest
or Additional Oil and Gas Interest affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the
Oil and Gas Interest subject to such Title Benefit or the fair market value of
the Additional Oil and Gas Interest affected and (iv) the amount by which
Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each of those Oil and Gas
Interests is increased by such Title Benefit, and the computations and
information upon which Purchasers belief is based including any analysis by
any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser. Seller has the right, but
not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser a similar notice on or before the
Pre-Closing Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by
Seller.

 



 

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Remedy Deadline, any
Title Defects for which Seller has received a timely Title Defect Notice from
Purchaser, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.4. If, by the
Remedy Deadline, Seller has not cured the Title Defects or if prior to
Closing, Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure
for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Amount, or (iii) whether the
alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, such dispute shall be finally
and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4(j);
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything stated in this Article 4 to
the contrary, Seller shall only be permitted to dispute after Closing the
matters described above to the extent that the affected Property was retained
by Seller at Closing pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(ii) and 4.4(d)(iii). Sellers
election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its
rights to have the matter decided under Section 4.4(j) and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute as to the existence, nature or value of the alleged Title Defect.
Prior to the Remedy Deadline and following the Closing, Seller shall conduct
any cure of alleged

 



      
 

 



 

Title Defects using its own resources, personnel and advisors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser, shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers efforts
but shall not be required to incur any out of pocket costs other than _de
minimus_ costs. Any disputed Title Defects that have not been cured, waived,
or otherwise resolved by the Parties prior to the Remedy Deadline shall be
exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.4(j). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller
shall deliver a written notice to Purchaser of its election to cure any Title
Defects prior to Closing.

 



 

(d) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject
to Section 4.4(c), cured prior to the Closing, Seller shall, at its sole
election, and subject to the Aggregate Title Deductible, elect prior to
Closing to:

 



 

(i) accept a reduction in the Unadjusted Purchase Price equal to an amount
determined pursuant to Section 4.4(h) (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") as being
the value of such Title Defect net of any Title Benefit Amount calculated in
accordance with Section 4.4(i); in which event, the Title Defect Amount shall
be deducted from the Unadjusted Purchase Price in accordance with Sections
5.3(c) and 8.1; or

 



 

(ii) only if the value of the Title Defect asserted by Purchaser in the Title
Defect Notice exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value for the
affected Title Defect Property, retain the entirety of the Title Defect
Property, in which event, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property in accordance with Sections 5.3(c) and 8.1; or

 



 

(iii) prior to the Remedy Deadline, at the sole cost and expense of Seller,
cure such Title Defect. If the Title Defect is not cured prior to Closing,
then the Title Defect Property will be excluded from the Closing and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property. Prior to the Remedy Deadline and upon Sellers curing the
Title Defect, the Purchaser will acquire the affected Property from Seller in
accordance with Section 5.4. If Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect
prior to the end of the Remedy Deadline, then such Property shall become an
Excluded Asset and no longer be considered as an Asset under this Agreement

 



 

(e) Upon Seller electing to retain a Title Defect Property because of a Title
Defect pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(ii) or 4.4(d)(iii), the Parties shall
complete any further conveyancing in accordance with Section 5.4.

 



 

(f) With respect to each Oil and Gas Interest or Additional Oil and Gas
Interest affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 4.4(b) (or which
Purchaser should have reported under such section), an amount (the " _Title
Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Oil
and Gas Interest or the fair market value of such Additional Oil and Gas
Interest caused by such Title Benefits will be determined pursuant to Section
4.4(i), and such Title Benefit Amount shall be exclusively used to offset any
Title Defect Amounts that are finally determined under this Section 4.4. If
Purchaser disputes any Title Benefit or Title Benefit Amount, it shall be
resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions governing Title
Defects in Section 4.4(j).

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Except with regard to Purchasers rights under the special warranty of
title in the Assignment, this Section 4.4 shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Purchaser with respect to Title Defects or any other matter related
to title or ownership of the Assets. In this regard and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to the Pre-Closing Claim
Date Purchaser identifies any matter that could be asserted as a Title Defect
which could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of a
Seller as set forth in Section 6.1, then Purchaser shall only be entitled to
assert such matter as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this Article 4
and shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the
breach of any such representation or warranty. For clarity, after the Pre-
Closing Claim Date, except with regard to claims under the special warranty of
title in the Assignment, Purchaser shall not have the right to assert any
claims for Title Defects (other than those that are the subject of a Title
Defect Notice submitted before the Pre-Closing Date).

 



 

(h) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title
Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
undisputed and liquidated amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from the appropriate Sellers interest in the affected Title Defect
Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Mineral
Acres for any Title Defect Property and the Net Mineral Acres shown in
_Exhibit A-1_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect property multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the Net Mineral Acres for the Title Defect Property and
the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres stated in _Exhibit A-1_, if
the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest
for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit A-2_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in Section (h)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and
such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect
Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price; and

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 



 

(i) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit described in Section 4.2(b)
shall be: (A) for any increase in Net Revenue Interest, the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_; (B)
for any increase in Net Mineral Acres, the product of the Allocated Value of
the affected Oil and Gas Interest multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Net Mineral Acres increase and the denominator of which is the
Net Mineral Acres stated in _Exhibit A-_1 and (C) for any Additional Oil and
Gas Interest, the fair market value thereof, determined with reference to the
Allocated Values of Oil and Gas Interests with characteristics similar to such
Additional Oil and Gas Interest.

 



 

(j) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and Title
Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively,
prior to the Closing, but Closing shall not be delayed because of failure to
so agree. If, by Closing, Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on an
alleged Title Defect/Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount
(the " _Disputed Title Matters_ "), the Title Defect Property which is the
subject of such Disputed Title Matter shall be retained by the Seller and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and shall be reflected in the
Preliminary Accounting Statement in accordance with Sections 5.3(c) and 8.1,
and such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively and
finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this Section
4.4(j).

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day following the Remedy Deadline an updated written description
meeting the requirements of Section 4.4(a), together with all supporting
documentation, of the Disputed Title Matters. By not later than ten (10)
Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description of the
Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written response
setting forth Sellers position with respect to the Disputed Title Matters
together with all supporting documentation, including a written description
meeting the requirements of Section 4.4(b) in the case of any Title Benefit
Amount asserted by a Seller.

 



 

(ii) By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of
Sellers written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed
Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any
such dispute(s) by written notice to Sellers of any Disputed Title Matters ("
_Final Disputed Title Matters_ ") not otherwise resolved or waived that are to
be resolved by arbitration (the " _Title Arbitration Notice_ ").

 



 

(iii) The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator (" _Title
Arbitrator_ "), determined as follows. Each arbitrator selected under this
subparagraph shall be an attorney with at least fifteen (15) years experience
examining oil and gas titles in Texas and shall not have

 



      
 

 



 

performed work for either Seller, Purchaser or their Affiliates for the past
five years or have a financial or other personal interest in either Party, any
Disputed Title Matters or outcome of the arbitration. Within three Business
Days, following receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice, Seller and Purchaser
shall each exchange lists of three acceptable, qualified arbitrators. Within
three (3) Business Days, following the exchange of lists of acceptable
arbitrators, Purchaser and Seller shall select by mutual agreement one
arbitrator from the combined lists. If no such agreement is reached, Purchaser
and Seller shall each, by 5:00 pm Central Time of the second Business Day,
following the exchange of lists of acceptable arbitrators, identify a single
arbitrator from their original list of three acceptable arbitrators. The two
selected arbitrators shall then agree on a third arbitrator from the original
lists within five (5) Business Days, following their own selection by each
Party, which shall be no more than ten (10) Business Days, following the Title
Arbitration Notice. Such third arbitrator shall serve as the Title Arbitrator.

 



 

(iv) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Title
Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (A)
this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 4.4(j), (B)
Purchasers written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters together
with the supporting documents that were previously provided to Seller pursuant
to Section 4.4(j)(i), (C) Sellers written response to Purchasers written
description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting
documents that were previously provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section
4.4(j)(i), and (D) the Title Arbitration Notice. Within five (5) Business Days
following such submissions, each of the Parties may submit one written
response to the other Partys submission. The Title Arbitrator shall resolve
the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on the foregoing submissions.
Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional
documentation or any additional written response to the Title Arbitrator nor
to demand discovery on the other Party.

 



 

(v) The Title Arbitrator shall choose a location convenient for deliberation,
or may deliberate by telephone conference. The Title Arbitrator shall make its
determination by written decision within thirty (30) Business Days following
Sellers receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice (the " _Title Arbitration
Decision_ "). The Title Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 4.4. The
Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to
advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities
of such consultants. Any such consultant shall not (i) be currently working
directly or indirectly as an employee or consultant for either Party, nor be
in discussions about potential future work for either Party, (ii) have worked
as an employee or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the
two-year period preceding the arbitration, or (iii) have any financial or
other personal interest in the dispute.

 



 

(vi) The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts or
Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award
damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

 



 

(vii) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
preparing and presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Title Arbitrator,

 



      
 

 



 

including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to
the consultation of any third Person.

 



 

(viii) Seller and Purchaser shall implement the Title Arbitration Decision as
follows: (A) in the case of alleged Title Defects determined to be Title
Defects, Seller shall elect to remedy, at its sole election, such Title
Defects pursuant to Section 4.4(d) within twenty (20) Business Days following
Sellers receipt of the Title Arbitration Decision, and (B) in the case of
disputed Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts, any amounts that are
determined to be owed to Seller shall be paid to Seller, and in the case of
disputed Title Defect Amounts, Seller shall pay any amounts determined to be
owed to Purchaser. Any alleged Title Defects/Title Benefits determined to be
or not to be Title Defects/Title Benefits under the Title Arbitration Decision
shall be final and binding as being or not being Title Defects/Title Benefits.
The Parties shall complete any further conveyancing in accordance with Section
5.4 to effect the remedy chosen by Seller pursuant to subsection (A) above.

 



 

(ix) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 4.4(j)
shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the
State of Texas. Any award of the Title Arbitrator may be enforced against both
Parties in the courts described in Harris County, Houston, Texas.

 



 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any remedies available under Section 4.4(d):

 



 

(i) for any Title Defect Amount with respect to an individual Title Defect
Property if such amount does not exceed fifty thousand United States Dollars
($50,000), but if exceeded, the entire Title Defect Amount related thereto
shall be counted for purposes of this Agreement, without deduction of this
individual threshold (the " _Individual Title Threshold_ "); and

 



 

(ii) unless the aggregate amount of all such Title Defect Amounts ( _provided_
that each such Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title Threshold and
excluding any Title Defect Amounts with respect to Title Defects cured by
Seller) exceeds the Aggregate Title Deductible, after which point, Purchaser
shall be entitled to remedies elected by Seller in accordance with Section
4.4(d) only to the extent that such Title Defects exceed the Aggregate Title
Deductible; _provided_ that the aggregate amount of all Title Benefit Amounts
shall be credited against and reduce any Title Defect Amounts.

 



 

In the event the aggregate amount of Title Benefit Amounts equals or exceeds
the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts, Seller shall not be entitled to
any payment from Purchaser with respect to such excess amounts.

 



 

(l) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in Section 15.7, time is of the essence in performing their obligations and
exercising their rights under this Article 4, and, as such, that each and
every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the
firm and final date and time.

 



      
 

 



 

4.5 **_Limitations on Applicability_** **.**

 



 

The right of Purchaser or Seller to assert a Title Defect or Title Benefit,
respectively, under this Agreement shall terminate on the Pre-Closing Claim
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that until the alleged Title Defect or Title
Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be, is
resolved in accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no termination of
Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section 4.4 with respect to any alleged
Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount
properly notified in accordance with Section 4.4 on or before the Pre-Closing
Claim Date.

 



 

4.6 **_Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase._**

 



 

(a) Promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of
any required consents to assignment to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate,
that are set forth on Schedule 6.1(i) or are otherwise identified prior to
Closing, requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 6.1(i) in
compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such
rights. The notices regarding consents required under this Section 4.6 shall
include language to the effect that the counterparty, to the extent it agrees
to give consent, is consenting to an assignment to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in one or more series of transactions. The consideration payable
under this Agreement for any Property for purposes of preferential purchase
right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Property. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Seller other than _de minimus_
costs) to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights
to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and
delivered prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to
assignment and waivers of preferential rights and will provide any additional
financial information, collateral or security as are required under the
Material Contracts to meet reasonable financial requirements demanded by
counterparties in order to obtain consents from such counterparties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event or circumstance shall
Seller be required to post collateral or security on behalf of the Purchaser
nor shall Purchaser be obligated to provide collateral or security in an
amount greater than as required in the applicable Material Contract.

 



 

(b) If Seller fails to obtain a Hard Consent, then (unless waived in writing
by Purchaser) the affected Property shall be excluded from the Assets to be
conveyed to Purchaser and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of such Property. In the event that a Hard Consent that
was not obtained prior to Closing, is obtained within one hundred and twenty
(120) days following Closing then within ten (10) days after such consent is
obtained, Purchaser shall purchase such Property in accordance with Section
5.4.

 



 

(c) If Seller fails to obtain a consent prior to the Closing and such consent
is not a Hard Consent then the Property subject to such unobtained consent
shall be assigned by Seller to Purchaser at Closing and Purchaser (or its
designated Affiliate) shall have no claim against, and Seller shall have no
liability for, the failure to obtain such consent.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) If Seller fails to obtain a Hard Consent which is waived by the Purchaser,
Purchaser hereby indemnifies and holds Seller harmless against all Losses
suffered or incurred by Seller, or any of its Affiliates, resulting from or in
connection with the assignment of the relevant Property from the Seller to the
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate without obtaining such Hard Consent.

 



 

(e) If any third Person exercises a preferential right to purchase any
Property prior to the Closing, Seller shall retain such Property in order to
convey such Property to such Person, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Property.

 



 

 **4.7** **THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE 4 AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY SET
FORTH IN THE ASSIGNMENT CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS ENTIRE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO
THE TITLE TO THE ASSETS.**

 



 

 **4.8** **EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 4 AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY SET
FORTH IN THE ASSIGNMENT, PURCHASER SHALL ACQUIRE THE ASSETS "WHERE IS" AND "AS
IS" WITH NO RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS FROM SELLER FOR ANY DEFECT
(INCLUDING TITLE DEFECTS) TO OR LIEN OR ENCUMBRANCE UPON THE TITLE TO THE
ASSETS.**

dispute any asserted Title Defects or Environmental Defects related thereto,
but subsequently become assignable to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (as to those applicable Assets being retained, collectively, the "
_Supplemental Closing Assets_ " and individually, a " _Supplemental Closing
Asset_ "), then there shall be a supplemental closing (the " _Supplemental
Closing_ ") on a date mutually agreed to by the Parties, but in no event later
than twenty (20) Business Days from the date such Supplemental Closing Asset
becomes, or is deemed to become assignable to Purchaser. At such Supplemental
Closing, Seller shall convey the applicable Supplemental Closing Asset to
Purchaser by means of an assignment and bill of sale using the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Allocated Value
attributable to such Supplemental Closing Asset, as adjusted by the Price
Adjustments, or other amount determined in accordance with this Agreement. The
Parties shall perform such other obligations in Section 5.3 that apply to that
Asset, including amending any such agreements to include the Supplemental
Closing Assets associated with the respective Supplemental Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with regard to the
Supplemental Closing Assets and the Supplemental Closing: (i) the conditions
to the obligations of the Parties to close set forth in Section 5.1 shall be
applicable with regard thereto as of the date of the Supplemental Closing,
instead of as of the date of Closing or the Closing Date, (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

the representations and warranties of the Parties in Article 6 shall also be
deemed made with regard thereto as of the Supplemental Closing (unless any
particular subsection therein specifies that it applies as of another date),
(iii) the covenants of the Parties set forth in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 shall
continue to apply with regard to the Supplemental Closing Assets until the
Supplemental Closing, (iv) the dates specified in Section 8.1 relating to the
Preliminary Accounting Statement and the Final Accounting Statement for such
Supplemental Closing Assets shall, instead, refer to the date of the
Supplemental Closing instead of any references therein to the Closing or
Closing Date, and (v) for purposes of any Assumed Obligations, Retained
Obligations and indemnification obligations under Article 11, any Supplemental
Closing Assets shall otherwise be treated as Excluded Assets unless and until
a Supplemental Closing relating thereto occurs.

and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and is duly qualified to carry
on its business in the State of Texas.

 



 

(b) _Validity of Agreement._ Seller has the corporate power to carry on its
business as presently conducted, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the

Seller and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller, duly
authorized and enforceable against it in accordance with the terms hereof,
subject to applicable bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting creditors
rights and to principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(c) _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller does
not, and the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereunder will not,
(i) violate any provision of, or constitute a default under, the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Seller, or (ii) materially violate any Law to
which Seller is subject, or any provision of any material agreement,
indenture, mortgage, lien, lease, instrument, order, arbitration award,
judgment, or decree to which Seller is a party or by which it or any of the

not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or
materially delay the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

proceeding pending, being contemplated or threatened against Seller.

 



 

(e) _Governmental Authorizations._ Seller has, to its Knowledge, all

virtue of Sellers organizational or governing documents) that is treated as a
partnership or any entity for federal, state or local income Tax purposes.

 



 

(i) _Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign._ The Assets are not subject
to any preferential rights to purchase, and, except for those consents that

(i) In relation to the transactions the subject of this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Related Parties has made, offered or authorized any
payment, gift, promise or other advantage, whether directly or through any
other person or entity, to or for the use or benefit of any Government
Official or any entity or other person where such payment, gift, promise or
other advantage would (A) comprise a Facilitation Payment; or (B) violate the
Anti-Bribery and Money-Laundering Laws and Obligations or any other applicable
law.

it is knowledgeable about and will comply with all laws, regulations, rules
and requirements relating to anti-money laundering applicable to its

Purchaser hereunder shall not constitute the proceeds of crime in
contravention of anti-money laundering laws.

under any contract or agreement or Hydrocarbon lease, being assigned (or by
which Purchaser will be bound) at Closing, for the sale of Hydrocarbons from
the Assets containing a take-or-pay, advance payment, prepayment, or similar
provision, or under any gathering, transmission, or any other contract or
agreement, being assigned at Closing (or by which Purchaser will be bound),
with respect to any of the Assets to gather, deliver, process, or transport
any Hydrocarbons without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor.

 



 

(o) _No Prepayments_. There have been no advance, take or pay or other
prepayments received by Seller with respect to Sellers interest in the Assets
that would obligate Purchaser to deliver Hydrocarbon production from the
Assets after the Effective Time without receiving full payment.

 



 

(p) _Outstanding Capital Commitments_. Except as listed on Schedule 6.1(p), as
of the Execution Date, there are no outstanding AFEs or other commitments to

reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures by the owner of
the Assets, net to its proportionate interest, after the Effective Time in
excess of two hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars ($250,000).

 



 

(q) _Environmental_. Seller has not received any written notice that the
Assets are not in compliance with any Environmental Laws, except for such non-
compliance which has been remediated or otherwise resolved. Seller has not
received any written notice of any claims against it with respect to
Environmental Liabilities with respect to the Assets or any demands to clean-
up any portion of the Assets, except for such claims or demands which have
been resolved and closed with the applicable Governmental Authority. With
respect to the Assets operated by Seller or its Affiliate (and to Sellers
Knowledge, with regard to Assets operated by a non-Affiliate third party),
neither Seller nor any Affiliate has entered into or is a party to or bound by
any agreement with or

(including funds held in suspense for unleased interests) by Seller as of the
date of Execution Date that are attributable to the Assets.

 



 

(s) _Imbalances_. As of the Effective Time, the Oil and Gas Interests are not
subject to any material Imbalances. In addition, there are no Imbalance
amounts that would be the obligation, liability or to the benefit of Purchaser
after Closing.

NOT AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING ANY MATTER OR
CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, THE
RELEASE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH,
SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE ENVIRONMENT, OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITION OF THE COMPANIES OR THE ASSETS, AND NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR
OTHERWISE SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.**

 



 

(c) Inclusion of a matter on a schedule attached hereto with respect to a
representation or warranty that addresses matters that are material or have a
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter is
material or does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedules may

" _Data Exchange_ ").

 



 

(b) Upon execution of and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser
may, at reasonable times during normal business hours, at Purchasers sole
cost and expense, conduct an expert investigation into the environmental
condition of the Properties for the purposes set out in Article 3 and the
status of title to the Oil and Gas Interests for the purposes set out in
Article 4 (the " _Pre-Acquisition Review_ ") in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 7.1(b). The entirety

 



       
 

 



 

of the Pre-Acquisition Review shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of
Section 7.4 below. During all periods that Purchaser or any of its
representatives are on the Assets, Purchaser shall maintain, at its sole
expense and with reputable insurers, such insurance as is reasonably
sufficient to support Purchasers indemnity obligations under Section 7.4.

 



 

The scope of the Pre-Acquisition Review includes:

 



 

(i) The right to enter all or any part of the Properties at any reasonable
time and with reasonable advance notice before accessing any Property (which
shall be not less than 48 hours advance notice), and to conduct an
environmental assessment which may include a Phase I review of the Properties,
as defined by the current American Society for Testing and Material (" _ASTM_
") Standard Practice for Phase I environmental property assessments
(Designation E1527-05), a review of the compliance status of the Assets
relative to Environmental Laws, a review of other site conditions including
the presence of endangered species habitat and waters of the United States,
and to otherwise inspect, inventory, investigate, perform environmental
assessments, study and examine the same and the operations conducted thereon
(provided that Purchaser shall have no right to conduct any invasive
environmental sampling or testing which includes, but is not limited to
digging and collecting samples on any Properties without the consent of
Seller, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion and may be
subject to any conditions), provided that Purchaser (including its agents or
consultants) be limited to two (2) visits to the Properties; and

 



 

(ii) The right, subject to compliance with applicable Law, including the HSR
Act, to inspect and review at Sellers offices at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice, all of the Records.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall maintain the results of its investigation, testing and
evaluation and review of files and records, confidential in accordance with
and otherwise comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall provide Seller a copy of any final environmental
assessment reports and the supporting documentation of or about the Properties
commissioned by Purchaser, including, without limitation, any reports, data
and conclusions developed pursuant to the Pre-Acquisition Review, promptly
after such assessment report has been furnished to or obtained by Purchaser,
and Seller shall be permitted to discuss the contents of any such assessment
reports with the party who prepared such reports. Neither Party shall be
deemed by its receipt of said documents to have made any representation or
warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets
or the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein.

 



 

(e) Seller shall have the right to have a representative or representatives
accompany Purchaser and Purchasers representatives (including without
limitation environmental consultants and experts) at all times during
Purchasers Pre-Acquisition Review. With respect to any samples taken in
connection with Pre-Acquisition Review, Purchaser shall take split samples,
providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified, to Seller
without charge. In the event that Purchasers Phase I identifies the need for
additional investigation or sampling, then Purchaser may request Sellers
consent to conduct Phase II environmental property assessments or

 



      
 

 



 

such other activities. The Phase II procedures and plan concerning any
additional investigation shall be submitted to Seller in a written
environmental property assessment plan, and shall be reasonable based on the
findings of the Phase I. Thereafter, Seller may, in its sole discretion,
approve said environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part, and
Purchaser shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such
plan until such time that Seller has approved such plan in writing; provided
that, in the event of the Sellers rejection of said environmental property
assessment plan, in whole or in part, Purchaser may request that an
independent environmental consultant or expert (not being the same person used
by the Purchaser) be engaged by Seller, at Purchasers cost, to verify
whether, in their opinion, a Phase II report is necessary. If such person
reports that a Phase II is necessary, but Seller still does not approve, the
Purchaser (i) may still deliver an Environmental Defect Notice with respect to
such Assets and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, may elect to have such Assets excluded from the transactions
contemplated hereunder whereby such Asset shall be deemed an Excluded Asset,
and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
such Excluded Assets.

 



 

(f) While conducting the Pre-Acquisition Review, Purchaser and its employees,
agents and consultants shall abide by Sellers safety rules, regulations and
other operating policies applicable to such Properties. Seller has the right
to be present during any activities conducted on the Assets as part of the
Pre-Acquisition Review.

 



 

(g) Purchaser shall not contact directly or indirectly, any Governmental
Authorities, lessors, midstream companies doing business with Seller in
connection with the Assets, or similar third parties, without Sellers express
written consent and limited to the purposes for which consent is sought.

 



 

7.2 **_Notification of Breaches._**

 



 

(a) Until the Closing Date;

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains Knowledge
that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement is

the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or observed
by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so performed or

performed or observed in a material respect.

 



 

(b) Any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties that are
untrue or that shall become untrue in any material respect between the
Execution Date and the Closing Date, and any of Purchasers or Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to the Closing Date
that have not been so performed or observed in any material respect, shall be

foregoing without the consent of Purchaser where needed to comply with
Sellers HSSE policies or to safeguard life, property or the environment;

7.4.**

 



 

7.5 **_Governmental Reviews._**

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
reasonably cooperate with the other Party (without obligation to spend money
in its cooperation with the other Partys efforts) in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities, (ii) the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, and (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except for any filing fees that may be imposed
by law on Seller, Seller shall not be required to pay or reimburse Purchaser
for any fees or other payments to any Governmental Authority in connection
with any such actions, approvals, or consents.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve prior
to Closing any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to Purchasers participation in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser, including by timely
providing such information and making available such personnel as Purchaser
may reasonably request to prepare for and participate in meetings with
Governmental Authorities, and/or to respond to any questions raised by
Governmental Authorities.

 



 

If a Party intends to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority with respect to such filings, it shall give the other Party
reasonable prior notice of such meeting and permit the other Party to attend
such meeting to the extent practicable.

 



 

7.6 **_Operatorship._**

 



 

(a) Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are necessary
to become the successor operator of those Properties operated by Seller as of
the Effective Time (" _Operated Properties_ ") and to obtain all necessary
approvals of Governmental Authorities and will indemnify Seller Group from any
and all liabilities, costs and expenses in connection with the succession of
Seller by Purchaser as operator of the Operated Properties. Seller makes no
representation or warranty or provides any assurance that Purchaser shall
succeed Seller as operator of any portion of the Operated Properties;
provided, however, that Seller will assist, to the extent reasonable,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to succeed Seller as operator of any Well, at
no cost to Seller greater than a _de minimus_ cost, including designating
and/or appointing by assignment, to the extent legally possible, Purchaser as
successor operator or taking any other actions permitted or required under
applicable Laws, the applicable operating agreement or other governing
document (including executing letters whereby the applicable Seller resigns as
operator of all Seller-operated Wells and Assets).

 



 

(b) If any Governmental Authority has not accepted Purchaser, or Purchasers
designated operator, as operator of any Operated Properties at or after the
date that is one hundred twenty (120) days from the Closing Date, Purchaser
and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a mutually
beneficial solution to facilitate the transfer of operatorship to Purchaser or
its designated operator. If the Parties cannot agree on a mutually beneficial
solution, Seller may give the Purchaser notice and within thirty (30) days
following the expiry of such period requiring the Purchaser to re-assign or
cause to be re-assigned those applicable Assets to the Seller and the Seller
will return eighty-five percent (85%) of the applicable portion of the
Adjusted Initial Payment Amount relating to such returned Assets, together
with any other reasonable costs, expenses or amounts paid by Purchaser after
Closing relating to the prudent operation of such applicable Assets.

 



 

(c) **IF THERE IS A RE-ASSIGNMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.6(b), PURCHASER SHALL
INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER AND SELLER GROUP AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES
AND LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM PURCHASERS OPERATION OF THE ASSETS
DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN CLOSING AND THE DATE OF THE RE-ASSIGNMENT OF
THE ASSETS TO THE SELLER, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIMS ARISE FROM OR ARE
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLER**.

 



 

7.7 **_Recording and Filing._**

 



 

Within seven (7) Business Days of the Closing Date, Seller shall, at no
expense to Seller (other than _de minimus_ costs), use its reasonable
commercial efforts to file the P-4 Forms with the Commission. If Seller fails
to file the P-4 Forms after fifteen (15) Business Days from the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall have the right to file the P-4 Forms with the Commission.
In addition, within (30) days of Closing, Purchaser shall, at its expense, use
its reasonable commercial efforts to file or record the conveyance documents
other than P-4 Forms, as necessary with the appropriate governmental agencies
or records office. Seller and Purchaser shall provide a copy of same,
including recording date, to the other Party and any other contract parties
requiring the same.

 



 

7.8 **_Notice to Third Persons._**

 



 

In relation to lessors, royalty owners, operators, non-operators, purchasers
of production, other contract parties and Government Authorities Seller has
the right to notify all or such of those parties as it deems appropriate that
Purchaser has purchased the Assets and has assumed liability for the Assumed
Obligations relating to their continued operation from and after the Closing
Date, with an effective date of the Effective Time; provided that Seller shall
provide Purchaser with the form that such notices will take and Purchaser
shall have the right to consent to the such form, such

 



      
 

 



 

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Purchaser and
Seller shall execute all transfer orders, division orders, or letters-in-lieu
necessary to transfer payment of the proceeds from the sale of production from
the Assets as of the Effective Time to Purchaser, and joinders, ratifications
or other similar instruments required to transfer Assets as of the Effective
Time to Purchaser.

 



 

7.9 **_Property Records._**

 



 

Within fifteen (15) days after Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
electronic copies of the Records (subject to the limitations contained in this
Agreement) which were not already delivered by Seller. Any electronic
information or data provided shall be in the same format as that then
currently used by Seller and Seller is not required to perform or create
additional programming or system support in connection therewith. Seller may
retain photocopies, electronic images or other formats of the Records. Seller
may excise or redact Records to remove information that would constitute an
Excluded Record. Seller and Purchaser shall each appoint one (1) focal point
for coordination of the transfer of electronic information and data to
Purchaser.

 



 

7.10 **_Use of Name._**

 



 

On or before sixty (60) days after Closing, Purchaser will permanently remove,
or cause to be permanently removed (and not simply covered or obscured), from
the facilities pertaining to the Assets, the name, logo and service mark of
Seller and its Affiliates, and all variations and derivations thereof, and
will not thereafter make use thereof in respect of the Properties being
conveyed to Purchaser.

 



 

7.11 **_Seller s Insurance._**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (a) no insurance policies arranged for
the benefit of or provided to Seller or any member of Seller Group, including
any current insurance policies relating to the business or assets of Seller ("
_Current Insurance Policies_ "), shall continue after Closing and (b)
Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that no member of Purchaser Group
shall, make any claims under any such insurance policies or insurance coverage
in respect of facts, events or circumstances arising before or after Closing.
Purchaser further hereby acknowledges and agrees that no historic insurance
coverage provided by or to Seller, including the Current Insurance Policies,
shall be available to Purchaser or Seller after Closing, with the exception of
insurance coverages required by statute or law and, in such limited instances
only to the extent that the policies provide such historical coverage.
Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that it has no right, title or
interest in any unearned premiums on any policies maintained by or for the
benefit of Seller or any member of Seller Group.

 



 

7.12 **_Casualty Loss._**

 



 

If after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets
shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part of the
Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain
(collectively, " _Casualty Losses_ ") or if proceedings for such purposes
shall be pending or threatened, this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or proceeding, or the
threat of any such destruction,

 



      
 

 



 

taking or proceeding, and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such destruction or taking
without reduction of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; _provided, however_ ,
Seller shall pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by third parties by
reason of the destruction or taking of such Assets (up to the Allocated
Value), including any sums paid pursuant to any agreement or indemnity (for
avoidance of doubt other than insurance), and shall assign, transfer and set
over unto Purchaser all of the rights, title and interest of Seller in and to
any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from third
parties, including any agreement of indemnity, arising out of such destruction
or taking (up to the Allocated Value).

 



 

7.13 **_Data Privacy._**

 



 

(a) Each Party acknowledges that it may be required to process Personal Data
during the undertaking of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party
agrees that it shall comply with the obligations imposed by all applicable
Data Protection Laws and take appropriate technical and organizational
measures against unauthorized or unlawful processing of, accidental loss or
destruction of, or damage to Personal Data; _provided_ that, having regard to
the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any
measures, the measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to the harm
that might result from unauthorized or unlawful processing or accidental loss,
destruction or damage and the nature of the Personal Data to be protected.
These measures shall also aim at preventing unnecessary collection and further
processing of such Personal Data.

 



 

(b) All Personal Data made available to any Party or their representatives
hereunder shall be made available on an "as is" basis without any warranties,
either express or implied, as to the quality, completeness, accuracy,
validity, non-infringement or utility of such Personal Data. In no event shall
the Party providing Personal Data be liable for any actual, incidental,
punitive, consequential or other damages arising out of, or resulting from the
receiving Partys or their representatives (i) use of or reliance upon the
Personal Data or (ii) disclosure of the Personal Data to a third party in
breach of this Agreement or any applicable Data Protection Law. The Parties
agree that the Party responsible for a breach of data privacy or a violation
of relevant applicable Data Protection Laws will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the non-breaching Party from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, causes of actions, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, those involving theories of negligence or strict liability and
including court costs and attorneys fees) asserted against, resulting from,
imposed upon or incurred by the non-breaching Party as a result of, or arising
out of the breach of data privacy or a violation of relevant applicable Data
Protection Laws.

 



 

7.14 **_Environmental Reporting._**

 



 

For any reporting to a Governmental Authority related to the Assets that
because of the Closing Date and particular Law could involve the potential for
combined or split reporting, Purchaser and Seller shall confer at an agreed
time prior to Closing in order to resolve any issues related to such
reporting.

 



      
 

 



 

7.15 **_Assignable Seismic Data._**

 



 

If the Parties do not enter into the Reprocessed Seismic Data License at
Closing pursuant to Section 5.3(h), but subsequent to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser obtains, and demonstrates same to Seller, a license from the third-
party owner of the underlying seismic data prior to the date upon which the
Seller submits to Purchaser the Final Accounting Statement, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute the Reprocessed Seismic Data License, in the form
attached as Exhibit G, relating to the Assignable Seismic Data.

 



 

7.16 **_Interim Assistance with Survey, Staking and Permitting._**

 



 

Purchaser and Seller agree that from and after the Execution Date until the
Closing Date, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser (or its
Affiliates) with access to the Assets, identified in advance written notice to
Seller and during normal business hours, for the purposes of surveying,
staking and other preliminary surface work in order to facilitate Purchasers
drilling operations after Closing. Seller further agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (at no cost to Seller other than _de minimus_ costs) to
assist Purchaser in preparing any necessary Governmental Authorizations or
third party notifications for such post-Closing operations; provided, however,
that Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any costs, expenses and
liability associated therewith and for purposes of clarity, the indemnity
obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 7.4 shall expressly apply to any
access granted to or action taken by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.16.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 8._** ** _  ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE and EXPENSES_**

 



 

8.1 **_Adjustments to Purchase Price._**

 



 

The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows, without double
counting any amounts, (the " _Price Adjustments_ ").

 



 

(a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

 



 

(i) Property Expenses attributable to periods from and after the Effective
Time which have been paid by Seller;

 



 

(ii) Inventory;

 



 

(iii) Imbalances, if positive;

 



 

(iv) Owner Balances, if positive, pursuant to _Schedule 8.1_ ;

 



 

(v) Property and ad valorem taxes accrued by Seller and attributable to the
Assets after the Effective Time; and

 



 

(vi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

 



 

(i) Revenues;

 



 

(ii) Environmental Defects pursuant to Sections 3.2(b)(i) and 3.2(g)(viii),
subject to 3.2(h);

 



 

(iii) Title Defects pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(i), subject to 4.4(k);

 



 

(iv) Allocated Value of Assets that are excluded from this Agreement because
of (a) the exercise of preferential rights or unobtained Hard Consents
pursuant to Section 4.6(b); (b) Sellers election to exclude Assets under
Sections 3.2(b)(ii), 3.2(b)(iii), 3.2 (d) and 3.2(g)(viii), subject to 3.2(h);
(c) Sellers election to exclude Assets under 4.4(d)(ii), 4.4(d)(iii) and
4.4(j)(viii), subject to 4.4(k); and Purchasers election to exclude Assets
pursuant to Section 7.1(e);

 



 

(v) Imbalances, if negative;

 



 

(vi) Owner Balances, if negative, pursuant to Schedule 8.1;

 



 

(vii) Property and ad valorem taxes paid by Purchaser and attributable to the
Assets before the Effective Time;

 



 

(viii) Property Expenses attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time
which have been paid by Purchaser;

 



 

(ix) Any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement; and

 



 

(x) The expenses incurred during the period between the Effective Time and the
Closing Date which relate to the workover operations on the Crockett 1-26 1H

8.2 **_Preliminary Accounting Statement._**

 



 

Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall furnish
Purchaser with a good faith estimated accounting (" _Preliminary Accounting
Statement_ "), prepared in a manner consistent with Sellers past accounting
practices, reflecting the Price Adjustments as of the date of preparation of
such Preliminary Accounting Statement and the effect of such Price Adjustments
on the Unadjusted Purchase Price. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to
agree on the Preliminary Accounting Statement as soon as reasonably possible.
The amount resulting from the application of the Price Adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchaser Price included in the Preliminary Accounting Statement,
as agreed upon by the Parties, will be the " _Adjusted Initial Payment Amount_
"; _provided, however,_ that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment
set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Statement, then the Adjusted Initial
Payment Amount shall be that amount set forth in the draft Preliminary
Accounting Statement delivered by Seller to Purchaser

 



       
 

 



 

pursuant to this Section 8.2 and that any disagreement with respect to Title
Defects and Environmental Defects will be resolved pursuant to the applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 **_Final Accounting Statement._**

 



 

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) ** ** days after Closing, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a draft of the proposed final
accounting statement (the " _Final Accounting Statement_ ") setting forth
Sellers good faith updated determination of the Price Adjustments and applies
those Price Adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Final
Purchase Price_ ") which shall be the final amount payable by Seller or by
Purchaser (as the case may be) to the extent not already paid or taken into
account at Closing (the " _Adjusted Final Payment Amount")_. Parties shall
cooperate to avoid split month accounting for revenue. In the event Closing
does not occur on the first day of a calendar month, Seller will market
Hydrocarbon production, pay associated royalties for the calendar month in
which Closing occurs on Purchasers behalf, and Sellers remittance of the
amount of production sales, less royalties, paid by Seller to Purchaser will
be included in the Final Accounting Statement and the Adjusted Final Payment
Amount will be adjusted accordingly. To the extent reasonably required by
Seller, Purchaser shall assist in the preparation of the Final Accounting
Statement. Purchaser shall have the right to audit the Final Accounting
Statement. The Parties failure to complete the Final Accounting Statement
shall not constitute a waiver of the right to receive any amount otherwise
due. The Final Accounting Statement shall become final and binding upon the
Parties and payable thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by Purchaser,
unless Purchaser gives written notice of its disagreement (an " _Accounting
Notice_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Time is of the essence with respect
to the Accounting Notice. Any Accounting Notice shall specify in detail the
dollar amount, nature and basis of the disagreement so asserted. Purchaser
shall not be entitled to dispute any expenditure or payment made by Seller, as
a prudent operator, substantially in accordance such of Sellers past
practices as evident from the lease operating statements provided in the Data
Exchange, subject, in all instances, to the restrictions and limitations on
Sellers authority set forth in this Agreement, including those set forth in
Section 7.3. If an Accounting Notice is received by Seller in a timely manner,
then the Final Accounting Statement (as revised in accordance with clause
8.3(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(ii) below) shall become final and binding on the Parties
and any amounts due shall be payable by the earlier of thirty (30) days after
(i) the date Seller and Purchaser agree in writing with respect to all matters
as to which there is a disagreement or (ii) the date on which the Accounting
Referee issues its decision.

 



 

(b) During the sixty (60) days following the date of receipt by Seller of an
Accounting Notice, Seller shall make available the records relevant to the
disagreement and Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to all matters
specified in the Accounting Notice. If, at the end of such sixty (60) day
period, Seller and Purchaser have not reached agreement on such matters, the
matters that remain in dispute shall be submitted to a mutually agreed neutral
accountant (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for review and final binding
resolution. The Accounting Referee shall be a certified public accountant,
with at least 15 years of oil and gas accounting experience, who is an
employee or partner of a recognized independent public accounting firm and
experienced in oil and gas accounting. In the event the Parties cannot agree
upon the Accounting Referee, each Party will appoint a neutral accountant who
meets the criteria set forth in the foregoing sentence and the two selected
accountants shall appoint a third accountant meeting the foregoing criteria to
be the "Accounting Referee." All determinations and adjustments with respect
to allocating items to the period before or after the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time shall be in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and
this Agreement. The Accounting Referee shall render a decision resolving the
matters in dispute within fifteen (15) days following their submission to the
Accounting Referee. Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for one-
half of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee. In the event the
disagreement relates to a contract interpretation matter as opposed to an
accounting matter, such matter shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of
Article 16 and not this Article 8.

 



 

(c) If, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, a Party receives
any proceeds or makes any expenditure for the benefit of the other Party, it
shall promptly remit to the other Party the relevant amount (to the extent
such amounts had not been previously accounted for in the Final Accounting
Statement). No claim made pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) shall be valid
unless it is brought prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

8.4 **_Inventory_**

 



 

Seller shall gauge all merchantable Hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon substances
associated with the Mineral Interests in storage as of the Effective Time and
shall provide Purchaser with all reasonable detail and support necessary to
confirm such amounts.

 



 

8.5 **_Notice to Remitters of Proceeds and Expenses._**

 



 

After the Closing, the Parties shall inform the remitters of any proceeds
attributable to the Assets to pay Purchaser to the extent practical after the
Effective Time. To the extent that any remitter pays revenues or sends
invoices or claims (for Owner Balances or Property Expenses) to the incorrect
Party, that Party shall promptly remit such revenues (without interest) or
forward such invoices or claims to the correct Party.

 



 

8.6 **_Post-Closing Payments._**

 



 

Payments to be made following the Closing under this Agreement shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination is made that such payments are due and payable
to the Purchasers Account or Sellers Account (as the case may be).

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 9._** ** _  TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

9.1 **_Apportionment of Taxes._**

 



 

All Taxes (except as provided below) pertaining to the Assets or Hydrocarbon
production from the Assets and similar obligations, including, without
limitation, production, severance, excise, and other similar Taxes that are
based upon production of, or income or revenues from Hydrocarbons, are
Sellers responsibility where attributable to the period prior to the
Effective Time and Purchasers responsibility where attributable to the period
after the Effective Time (regardless of when assessed on the Assets or
Hydrocarbon production). Seller shall be allocated and shall bear all ad
valorem taxes, real property taxes, Personal Property taxes, and similar Tax
obligations (the "Property Taxes") with respect to the Assets for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser
shall be allocated and shall bear all Property Taxes with respect to the
Assets for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the
Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Property Taxes for any Tax period in which the Effective Time occurs shall be
apportioned based on the number of days in such Tax period before and after
the Effective Time, between Seller and Purchaser. To the extent possible,
amounts relating to such Taxes shall be included in the Final Accounting
Statement, but the Final Accounting Statement shall not constitute a final
settlement of Tax liability as allocated between the Parties pursuant to this
Section 9.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be responsible
for its own federal, state, or local income taxes, gross margin taxes,
franchise taxes or gross receipts taxes with respect or attributable to the
ownership of the Assets and the transactions pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and each Party agrees to indemnify and hold the other Party harmless
with respect to such Taxes. ** PURCHASER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD
HARMLESS SELLER FOR ALL PROPERTY AND HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE
TO ANY TAX PERIOD (OR PORTION THEREOF) ENDING ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE
AND SELLER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS PURCHASER FOR ALL
PROPERTY HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY TAX PERIOD (OR
PORTION THEREOF) ENDING PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE.**

 



 

9.2 **_Transfer Taxes._**

 



 

Purchaser shall be responsible for paying Transfer Taxes or other fees, if
any, that are payable upon or because of the transfer of any of the Assets to
Purchaser. " _Transfer Taxes_ " means any sales, use, excise, stock, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, registration, authorization and similar taxes,
fees and charges. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate (including by the
provision of exemption certificates, documentation to support an occasional or
isolated sale exemption, or other evidence or documentation) to reduce the
amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

9.3 **_Tax Reporting of the Allocation of Purchase Price._**

 



 

Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate the Final Purchase Price and any
liabilities assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement based on the Allocated
Values provided that no more than 10% of the Purchase Price shall be allocated
to tangible property and no less than 90% shall be allocated to the Mineral
Interests. Seller and Purchaser each agree that the Assets subject to this
Agreement do not constitute an "applicable asset acquisition" as described
under Code Section 1060, and do not constitute a trade or business in the
ordinary sense of the term. Seller and Purchaser each agree to report the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated herein as a purchase and sale of
assets, and in particular to report the information consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith upon
examination of any Tax return, in any refund claim, in any litigation,
investigation or otherwise unless required to do so by applicable Law after
notice to the other Party, or with such other Partys prior consent.

 



 

9.4 **_Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings._**

 



 

Purchaser and Seller will cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns
with respect to the Properties (other than with respect to income and
franchise taxes) and any audit, litigation or other proceedings.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 10._** ** _  PURCHASERS ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS_**

 



 

10.1 **_Purchaser s Assumed Obligations._**

 



 

At Closing, but with effect from the Effective Time (except for the matters
below stated to take effect at a time other than the Effective Time) and
subject to and except with regard to any of Purchasers rights in relation to
(i) the Retained Obligations, (ii) indemnification set forth in Article 11,
and (iii) post-Closing matters relating to Title Defects and Environmental
Defects, Purchaser shall assume and agree to fulfill, perform, pay and
discharge all of the obligations and liabilities arising from, related to or
connected with the ownership, operatorship (where applicable) and operation of
the Assets (all of which shall constitute the " _Assumed Obligations_ "). The
Assumed Obligations include, without limitation, the following:

 



 

(a) the express and implied obligations, conditions and covenants under the
terms of all contracts, agreements, instruments and orders to which the Assets
are subject, other than the Excluded Contracts, and including, for the
avoidance of doubt, liability for breach of any of the foregoing, whether such
breach occurred prior to or after the Effective Time;

 



 

(b) the responsibility for compliance with all applicable Laws, the

Upon and after Closing, but with effect from the Effective Time, Purchaser
assumes full responsibility and liability for all plugging, abandonment and

10.3 **_Environmental Obligations._**

 



 

Subject to the Retained Obligations and excluding any liability or condition
that relates to any Excluded Assets, and subject to Purchasers right to
indemnification in relation to Section 6.1(q) set forth in Article 11, and the
rights the Purchaser may have in relation to any Final Disputed Environmental

responsibility and liability for all liabilities and obligations arising out
of, related to, or connected with, the environmental condition of the Assets
(" _Environmental Obligations_ "), including without limitation, claims
arising out of the following circumstances, conditions, occurrences, events
and activities on or related to the Assets, regardless of whether occurring,
or arising or resulting from any acts or omissions of Seller or any other
Person prior to the Effective Time and regardless of the condition of the

10.4 **_Additional Security for Assumed Obligations._**

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall procure
that its designated Affiliate shall, deliver to Seller (to the attention of
the Shell Legacy Representative in accordance with the terms of Section 15.5)
a certificate certified by an officer of Purchaser, certifying that:

 



 

(i) the P-4 Form has been filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") and approved by the Commission identifying the Operated
Properties as Properties for which the Purchaser is the successor operator and
assumes plugging and decommissioning responsibility;

 



 

(ii) with respect to Operated Properties, if applicable, Purchaser has filed
with the Commission an active organization report that meets the requirements
of Section 91.142 of the Texas Natural Resources Code (the " _TNRC_ ") and any
relevant Commission rules, guidance or regulations; and

 



 

(iii) with respect to Operated Properties, if applicable, Purchaser has
obtained a Commission-approved bond, letter of credit, or cash deposit
covering such Operated Properties and such bond, letter of credit, or cash
deposit must be in compliance with:

 



 

(1) Sections 91.103-107 of the TNRC; and

 



 

(2) any other relevant law, statute, rule guidance or regulation.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Commission has approved and
accepted the Purchasers P-4 Form filing, Purchaser shall deliver evidence of
such approval to Seller (to the attention of the Shell Legacy Representative
in accordance with the terms of Section 15.5) which evidence must be
reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Approval Evidence_ "); provided,
however, that if the Commission provides written notice of any objection to
such Purchasers P-4 Form filing, the sixty-day period described in Section
10.4(a) above shall be extended for another forty-five (45) days after receipt
of the Commissions objection to file a corrective P-4 Form. Upon Sellers
receipt of (i) the certificate described in Section 10.4(a) above, and (ii)
the Approval Evidence, then automatically and with no further action required
by either Party, Purchaser shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
under this Section 10.4, and this Section 10.4 shall automatically terminate
(with no further action by or notice to any Party) and be of no further force
and effect. If Purchaser has not (x) timely delivered the certificate
described in Section 10.4(a) above to Seller or (y) delivered the Approval
Evidence in each case within (9) months after the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date, Purchaser must provide to Seller, within fifteen (15) days after
the expiration of the applicable deadline set forth in Section 10.4(a) above
or in this sentence, Decommissioning Security in an amount equal to twenty
million United States Dollars ($20,000,000), which Seller may draw upon in the
event Purchaser does not fulfill its obligations under Section 10.2, (the "
_Secured Obligations_ "), without limiting any other remedies Seller has
hereunder or at law or in equity. Once the Seller draws upon the
Decommissioning Security, it must use the funds for the sole purpose of
satisfying such Section 10.2 obligations as the obligations fall due and in
any event within twenty-four (24) months, and Seller shall provide detailed
statements, invoices and receipts with regard to the use of such funds to
evidence Sellers compliance with these provisions. Seller shall have the
right, not more than once every two years, to require that Purchaser increase
the amount of the Decommissioning Security by a percentage equal to the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from the date of this
Agreement (in the event of the first increase) or from the date of the most
recent Decommissioning Security increase (in the event of subsequent
increases). Should Seller decide to exercise such right, Seller must provide
written notice to Purchaser in the manner set forth in Section 15.5 of this
Agreement, and Purchaser must provide evidence of its compliance with Sellers
request within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser expressly covenants that it will continue to comply in all
material respects with all laws, statutes, rules, and regulations which allow
for the release of Sellers liability and plugging responsibility contemplated
in this Article 10, including without limitation Sections 89.011, 89.012,
91.103-.107, and 91.142 of the TNRC.

 



 

(d) If Purchaser is required to provide Decommissioning Security, then on or
before each anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser must deliver to Seller
(to the attention of the Shell Legacy Representative in accordance with the
terms of Section 15.5) a report describing the status of all the Secured
Obligations, such report to include without limitation the following:

 



 

(i) an update of contact information for the primary personnel within
Purchasers organization who are involved with the fulfillment of the Secured
Obligations;

 



 

(ii) an update of the progress of the Secured Obligations;

 



 

(iii) an updated plan for how Purchaser intends to fulfill the Secured
Obligations; and

 



 

(iv) any changes to ownership status due to a conveyance or assignment that
alter the party responsible for fulfilling the Secured Obligations.

 



 

(e) Conveyance or assignment of this Agreement or the Assets to another party
does not release Purchaser from obligations under this Section 10.4.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 11._** ** _  INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

11.1 **_Indemnification._**

 



 

(a) Upon Closing, Purchaser shall, except to the extent that a claim or matter
is indemnified by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1(b), indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Seller and each member of Seller Group from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, losses, causes of actions, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, those involving theories of negligence or
strict liability and including court costs and attorneys fees) (" _Losses_ ")
asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by Seller or such other persons
entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.1(a) as a result of, or
arising out of:

 



 

(i) the breach (without regard to any qualification of materiality or Material
Adverse Effect) of any of the representations or warranties of Purchaser
contained in Section 6.3 when made at either the Execution Date or Closing
Date (as applicable);

 



 

(ii) the failure of Purchaser to perform any of the covenants or agreements of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement;

(iv) any obligations for a brokerage or finders fee or commission incurred by
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 



 

(v) any violation or alleged violation of securities laws by Purchaser in
connection with the Assets and any claim arising out of Purchasers dealings
with its partners, investors, lender, assignees or other third Persons in
connection with the transactions evidenced by this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) Purchasers liability, if any, with regard to the ownership or operation
of any portion of the Assets that may be re-conveyed or reassigned to Seller
pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6(b);

 



 

(vii) the cost and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, of
enforcing this Section 11.1(a).

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 11.1(d), upon Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, and Purchasers and such
Affiliates directors, officers, employees, stockholders and agents, from and
against all Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by Purchaser or
such other persons entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.1(b) as a
result of, or arising out of:

 



 

(i) the breach (without regard to any qualification of materiality or Material
Adverse Effect) of any of the representations or warranties of Seller
contained in Section 6.1 when made at either Execution Date or Closing Date
(as applicable);

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the failure of Seller to perform any of the covenants or agreements of
Seller contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the Excluded Assets;

 



 

(iv) the Retained Obligations;

 



 

(v) any obligations for a brokerage or finders fee or commission incurred by
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(vi) the cost and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, of enforcing
this Section 11.1(b); and

 



 

(vii) the Interim Period Indemnification Matters.

 



 

(c) **_EXTENT OF INDEMNIFICATION_** **. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE
SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, DEFENSE AND ASSUMPTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AN INDEMNIFIED PERSON
SHALL BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF
SECTIONS 11.1(a) OR 11.1(b), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ACT, OCCURRENCE OR
CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO ANY SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT
OF THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY ANY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON,
_PROVIDED_ THAT NO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT OF
ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON.**

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the liability
of Seller and Purchaser under this Agreement and any documents delivered in
connection herewith or contemplated hereby shall be limited as follows:

 



 

(i) Except for the Fundamental Representations, which survive indefinitely,
the representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date for a period of nine (9) months and all
representations and warranties of the Parties under this Agreement shall
terminate nine (9) months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that any
such representation or warranty for which a written notice of claim specifying
in reasonable detail the specific nature of the Losses and the estimated
amount of such Losses (" _Claim Notice_ ") delivered in good faith in
compliance with the requirements of this Section 11.1(d) shall survive with
respect only to the specific matter described in such Claim Notice until the
earlier to occur of (A) the date on which a final non-appealable resolution of
the matter described in such Claim Notice has been reached or (B) the date on
which the matter described in such Claim Notice has otherwise reached final
resolution. The indemnities in Section 11.1(a)(ii)  (vii) and Section
11.1(b)(iv) shall survive the Closing Date indefinitely. The indemnities in
Section 11.1(b)(vii) shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve
months and the indemnities in Sections

 



      
 

 



 

11.1(b)(iii), (v) and (vi) shall survive the Closing Date for a period of
seven (7) years. For purposes of clarity, any Losses arising from or
attributable to Retained Obligations shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 11.1(d)(ii)(B) or Section 11.1(d)(ii)(C) and any Losses
arising from or attributable to the Interim Period Indemnification Matters
shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.1(d)(ii)(B).
Covenants to be performed at or after Closing shall survive until performed.
Claims for covenants to be performed prior to Closing shall survive for twelve
months after the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall:

 



 

(A) SELLER OR PURCHASER BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
LOSSES (EXCEPT WHERE SUCH LOSSES CONSTITUTE PART OF A CLAIM OF A THIRD PERSON
WHICH IS INDEMNIFIED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT), LOSS OF
PROFITS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, OR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES
THAT MAY BE AWARDED IN THE OTHER PARTYS FAVOR; and

 



 

(B) Seller indemnify Purchaser, or be otherwise liable to Purchaser for any
Losses arising from a breach of a representation or warranty of Seller that is
not a Fundamental Representation (1) for any individual claim for Loss that
does not exceed fifty thousand United States Dollars ($50,000), but if
exceeded, the entire amount of the Loss thereto shall be counted for purposes
of this Agreement, without deduction of this individual threshold (the "
_Individual Threshold_ "), and (2) until Purchaser has suffered Losses in the
aggregate in excess of the Aggregate Indemnity Deductible, after which point
Seller will be obligated only to indemnify Purchaser from and against further
Losses in excess of the Aggregate Indemnity Deductible; and

 



 

(C) Seller indemnify Purchaser under (1) Sections 11.1(b)(i), 11.1(b)(ii) and
11.1(b)(vii) in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price or (2) Sections 11.1(b)(v) and (vi) in excess of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price.

 



 

(iii) No amount shall be recovered from any Party for the breach or untruth of
any representations or warranties, of the other Party, or for any other
matter, to the extent that the Party claiming a Loss as a result thereof had
actual Knowledge of such breach, untruth or other matter at or prior to the
Execution Date, nor shall such Party be entitled to rescission with respect to
any such matter.

 



 

(iv) The amount of any indemnification provided under Section 11.1(a) or (b)
shall be net of any amounts of insurance proceeds or other amount from any
third person actually recovered or realized by the indemnified party in
respect of the indemnification claim to which such insurance proceeds or other
amounts relate.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary: (A) neither Party
will have any liability to the other Party or such other Partys indemnified
parties under this Article 11 with respect to any item for which a specific
adjustment has already been made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under the
terms of this Agreement; and (B) Seller will have no liability to Purchaser or
Purchasers indemnified parties hereunder for any matter which is claimed as a
Title Defect or

 



       
 

 



 

an Environmental Defect. Claims for Title Defects or Environmental Defects,
even those not resulting in an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
because the applicable aggregate deductible is not exceeded, are not subject
to the terms of this Article 11, may not be claimed under this Article 11, may
not be included for purposes of determining whether the limitations set forth
in this Section 11.1(d) have been met and may not be included in the Aggregate
Indemnity Deductible for purposes of the limitations set forth in this Section
11.1(d). Nothing herein, however, limits Purchasers rights and claims under
the special warranty of title in the Assignment.

 



 

(vi) Each person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to damages
in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and
damages after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any losses, costs, expenses and damages that are indemnifiable
or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

(e) All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and
resolved pursuant to this Section 11.1(e). Any Person claiming indemnification
hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and any
Person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Indemnifying Party_." In the event that any Losses are asserted
against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a third Person,
said Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the
Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such Losses
if the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in reasonably sufficient time
so that the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Losses is not
materially prejudiced. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from
the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ")
to notify the Indemnified Party; (i) whether or not it disputes the liability
of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to
such Losses and/or (ii) whether or not it desires, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against
such Losses; provided, however, that any Indemnified Party is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party (and of which it shall have given
notice and opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party). In the event
that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate
proceedings with counsel of its own choosing, which proceedings shall be
promptly settled or prosecuted by them to a final conclusion. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense
or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Losses that the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate and related to the
claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
third-party Losses, or any cross-complaint against any person. No claim may be
settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party and no claim may be settled or compromised by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement or
compromise entails a full and

 



      
 

 



 

unconditional release of the Indemnified Party without any admission or
finding of fault or liability.

 



 

11.2 **_Exclusive Remedy._**

 



 

If Closing occurs, the indemnities set forth in this Agreement and the
remedies expressly provided for herein, together with, and the special
warranty of title in the Assignment, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of the parties indemnified hereunder for breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 11.2 shall be deemed to affect any Persons right
to post-Closing equitable relief (including specific performance in a court of
law) for breach of a covenant set forth in this Agreement (whether or not such
covenant is set forth in Article 7), nor shall it affect any Partys right to
avail itself of the other dispute resolution provisions set forth in this
Agreement relating to Title Defects, Environmental Defects, and accounting
matters. Except for such remedies and the special warranty of title in the
Assignment, Purchaser shall be deemed to release and forever discharge Sellers
and their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers,
members, employees, agents, advisors and representatives from any and all
other Losses whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such
parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising
from Sellers ownership, use or operation of the Properties, or the condition,
quality, status or nature of the Properties, including rights to contribution
under CERCLA or any other Environmental Law, breaches of statutory or implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages and
common law rights of contribution, rights under agreements between Seller or
any of its Affiliates, and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or any
of its Affiliates, **EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, GROSS OR CONCURRENT, BUT EXCLUDING WILLFUL MISCONDUCT),
OF ANY RELEASED PERSON**.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 12._** ** _  CONFIDENTIALITY_**

 



 

12.1 Subject to Section 12.2 and without prejudice to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, until the earlier of Closing or termination of this
Agreement, all confidential information furnished or disclosed to the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates by Seller or its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Confidential
Information_ ") shall be held confidential by the Purchaser and shall not be
divulged in any way by Purchaser to any third party without the prior written
approval of Seller provided that Purchaser may, without such approval,
disclose such Confidential Information to:

 



 

(a) any outside professional consultants, upon obtaining a similar undertaking
of confidentiality (but excluding this proviso) from such consultants;

 



 

(b) any bank or financial institution from whom Purchaser is seeking or
obtaining finance, upon obtaining a similar undertaking of confidentiality
(but excluding this proviso) from such bank or institution;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) any department, authority, ministry or agency of any government or other
governmental authority lawfully requesting such information;

 



 

(d) any court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction acting in
pursuance of its powers;

 



 

(e) any of its Affiliates upon obtaining a similar undertaking of
confidentiality from such Affiliates; and

 



 

(f) any of its employees or contractors (in the case of contractors, upon
obtaining a similar undertaking of confidentiality) who have a need to know
such information both prior to Closing and after Closing;

 



 

(g) any disclosure in connection with any capital markets transaction of
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, whether equity or debt, provided that
recipients of the information are under an obligation of confidentiality;

 



 

(h) any disclosure to a prospective buyer or assignee, as long as they are
bound by a confidentiality agreement with a similar undertaking of
confidentiality;

 



 

(i) the extent required by any applicable laws, or the requirements of any
recognised stock exchange or the Securities and Exchange Commission in
compliance with its rules and regulations.

 



 

12.2 The Purchaser agrees that any information obtained by, furnished or
disclosed to the Purchaser relating to Environmental Defects shall remain
confidential indefinitely and the time period in Section 12.1 above shall not
apply to this information.

 



 

12.3 The Purchaser shall remain bound by this Article 12, notwithstanding any
termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, the Purchaser
shall, at the request of the Seller, promptly return to the Seller (and delete
from the Purchasers systems, where electronically stored) all Confidential
Information.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 13._** ** _  TERMINATION_**

 



 

13.1 **_Termination._**

 



 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time after the Execution Date and
prior to the actual occurrence of the Closing (or, with regard to the
Supplemental Closing Assets only, prior to the actual occurrence of the
Supplemental Closing) only:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, at any time after April 20, 2018 by written
notice to the other Party if the Closing has not occurred on or before such
date; provided, however, that solely with regard to the Supplemental Closing

written notice to the other Party if the Supplemental Closing with regard to
such Supplemental Assets has not occurred on or before such date);

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by either Seller or Purchaser, by written notice to the other Party, if a
Governmental Authority shall have issued an injunction, order or award or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such injunction, order, award or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable;

 



 

(d) by Seller, immediately on written notice to Purchaser, if

 



 

(i) Purchaser fails to pay the Performance Deposit on the date due hereunder;

 



 

(ii) Purchaser fails to pay the Adjusted Initial Payment Amount on the Closing
Date, unless Closing is delayed because the conditions in Section 5.1(a) are
not satisfied;

 



 

(iii) Purchaser otherwise breaches or fails to perform its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or breaches
or failure or failures to perform; (A) would, individually or in the
aggregate, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
5.1(b); and (B) cannot be cured or, if curable, is not or are not cured within
ten (10) days after receiving written notice from Seller;

 



 

(iv) Purchaser wrongfully fails to tender performance at Closing in breach of

having been fully satisfied; provided that Purchasers failure to close shall
not be considered wrongful if (i) Purchasers conditions under Section 5.1(a)
are not satisfied through no fault of Purchaser and are not waived by
Purchaser, or (ii) Purchaser has terminated this Agreement according to its
right under Section 13.1(a), (b), (c), (e) or (f); or

 



 

(v) fails to provide such additional collateral or security as required
pursuant to any Material Contract in relation to a required consent as set
forth in Section 4.6(a);

 



 

(e) by Purchaser, immediately on written notice to Seller, if

 



 

(i) Seller breaches or fails to perform its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or breaches or failure or
failures to perform; (A) would, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.1(a); and (B) cannot be
cured or, if curable, is not or are not cured within ten (10) days after
receiving written notice from Purchaser; or

 



 

(ii) Seller wrongfully fails to tender performance at Closing or otherwise
materially breaches this Agreement; provided that Sellers failure to close
shall not be considered wrongful if (i) Sellers conditions under Section
5.1(b) are not satisfied through no fault of Seller or are not waived by
Seller; or (ii) Seller has terminated this Agreement according to its rights
under Section 13.1(a), (b), (c), (d) or (f).

 



 

(f) by either Seller or Purchaser, if under the HSR Act or otherwise, the
Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice shall have
commenced or threatened to

 



      
 

 



 

commence any proceeding to delay or enjoin or seek damages in respect of the
transactions evidenced by this Agreement ("threatened," for purposes of this
Section 13.1(d), means an actual vote of the Commissioners of the Federal
Trade Commission to commence such a proceeding). For purposes of clarity,
issuance of a second request by either the Federal Trade Commission or the
U.S. Department of Justice shall not constitute a proceeding to delay or
enjoin or seek damages in respect of the transactions evidenced by this
Agreement;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (d), or (e) above if that Party is at the

other claims or liabilities with regard to termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.1(d)(ii-v), Seller

15.1 **_Expenses of Sale._**

 



 

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Party to this Agreement
shall pay its own expenses (including without limitation, the fees and
expenses of their respective agents, representatives, counsel and accountants)
with respect to the negotiation, execution and the delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions under this Agreement.

 



 

15.2 **_Third Party Rights._**

 



 

Except as to those indemnity obligations owed to the indemnified Persons
listed in Section 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), the indemnity, release and waiver
provisions in this Agreement in favor of Seller Group, and the provisions of
Sections 2.6 and 7.4, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not create benefits on behalf of any person who is not a
Party to this Agreement (including without limitation, any broker or finder,
creditor or other Person), and this Agreement shall be effective only as
between the Parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

15.3 **_Further Actions._**

 



 

Purchaser and Seller further agree that they will, from time to time and upon
reasonable request, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered, such instruments, and take such other action as
may be necessary, or advisable, to carry out their obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

15.4 **_Assignment; Designation of Certain Affiliates to Receive Assets._**

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 2.5 and as set forth below, neither Party
shall assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement prior to Closing without obtaining the prior written consent of the
other Party, and any purported assignment by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party shall be void; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement to the contrary, at or prior
to Closing, Purchaser shall have the right, without consent or approval of
Seller, to designate in writing one or more of Purchasers Affiliates to
receive specified Assets at Closing directly from Seller, but such designation
or receipt of such Assets by an Affiliate shall not alter or relieve Purchaser
of its obligations under this Agreement with regard thereto.

 



 

(b) After Closing, in the event that Purchaser sells or assigns all or a
portion of the Properties, (i) this Agreement shall remain in effect between
Purchaser and Seller regardless of such assignment, and such assignment shall
not constitute a release or novation of any obligation or

 



      
 

 



 

liability owed by Purchaser to Seller under this Agreement; (ii) Purchaser
shall require its successors and assigns to expressly assume the Assumed
Obligations and all of its other duties, responsibilities and obligations
under this Agreement, to the extent related or applicable to the Assets or the
portion thereof acquired by them, but such assumption shall not release
Purchaser from any such Assumed Obligation or other duty, responsibility or
obligation, and such assumption by Purchasers successors and assigns shall be
in a writing delivered to Seller; and (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, no
such assignment will in any way relieve Purchaser of any obligations under
Section 10.4, solely to the extent such obligations in Section 10.4 are
surviving as of the time of said assignment.

 



 

15.5 **_Notices._**

statement with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, such
Party shall obtain the written approval of the other Party to the text of such
announcement or statement, which approval may be withheld for any reason.
Nothing contained in this Section 15.6 shall be construed to require either
Party to obtain approval of the other Party to disclose information with
respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to any Governmental
Authority and/or the public to the extent required by applicable Law or stock
exchange regulation; provided that a Party required to make such a disclosure
shall consult with the other Party prior to making such disclosure.

 



 

15.7 **_Seller s _****_Time Limits; Waiver._**

 



 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement and all time limits shall be strictly
construed and enforced. Subject to the foregoing, however, the failure or
delay of any Party in the enforcement of the rights granted under this

limits contained in this Agreement, such Party may exercise its rights under
this Agreement despite any delay or failure to enforce the rights when the
right or obligation arose.

 



 

15.8 **_Applicable Law._**

15.9 **_Severance of Invalid Provisions._**

 



 

In case of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of any applicable laws or regulations, the provisions of the laws
or regulations shall govern over the provisions of this Agreement. If, for any
reason and for so long as, any clause or provision of this Agreement is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable or
unconscionable under any present or future law (or interpretation thereof),
the remainder of this Agreement shall

 



       
 

 



 

not be affected by such illegality or invalidity. Any such invalid provision
shall be deemed severed from this Agreement as if this Agreement had been
executed with the invalid provision eliminated.

 



 

15.10 **_Construction and Interpretation._**

 



 

The interpretation and construction of the terms of this Agreement will be
governed by the following conventions:

 



 

(a) _Headings for Convenience_. Except for the definition headings, all the
table of contents, captions, numbering sequences, paragraph headings and
punctuation used in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall
in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Agreement or
any part thereof, nor have any legal effect.

 



 

(b) _Gender and Number_. The use of pronouns in whatever gender or number shall
be deemed to be a proper reference to the Parties to this Agreement though the
Parties may be individuals, business entities or groups thereof. Any necessary
grammatical changes required to make the provisions of this Agreement refer to
the correct gender or number shall in all instances be assumed as though each
case was fully expressed.

 



 

(c) _Independent Representation_. Each Party has had the benefit of
independent legal representation with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions. This Agreement shall be construed fairly and reasonably
and not more strictly against one Party than another, on the basis of who
drafted this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 



 

(d) _Section References_. Unless otherwise stated, references in this
Agreement to articles, sections or subsections are references to the articles,
sections or subsections of this Agreement.

 



 

15.11 **_Days._**

 



 

If a deadline falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the deadline
will extend to the next Business Day.

 



 

15.12 **_Integrated Agreement._**

 



 

This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules attached and incorporated herein,
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the instruments delivered at or in
connection with the Closing hereunder contain the final and entire agreement
of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this contract. There are
no representations, warranties or promises, oral or written, between the
Parties other than those included in this Agreement or in any such Closing
document. Upon execution of this Agreement by all Parties, this Agreement
shall supersede and replace all previous negotiations, understandings or
promises, whether written or oral, relative to the subject of this Agreement.
Each of the Parties acknowledges that no other Party has made any promise,
representation or warranty that is not expressly stated in this Agreement or
in any Closing document. This Agreement shall not be modified or changed (nor
any provision of this Agreement waived) except

 



      
 

 



 

by a written amendment signed by all the Parties. This Agreement is entire as
to all the performances to be rendered under it, and breach of any provision
shall constitute a breach of the entire Agreement. A waiver of any breach or
failure to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not
in any way affect, limit or waive a Partys rights under this Agreement at any
time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with any other term or condition
of this Agreement.

 



 

15.13 **_Binding Effect._**

 



 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

15.14 **_Multiple Counterparts._**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed by signing the original or a counterpart
hereof. If this Agreement is executed in multiple counterparts, each
counterpart shall be deemed an original, and all of which when taken together
shall constitute but one and the same agreement with the same effect as if all
Parties had signed the same instrument.

 



 

15.15 **_Fair Notice Disclosure Statement._**

 



 

PURCHASERS ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT
REQUIRE PURCHASER TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER HARMLESS IRRESPECTIVE
OF THE STRICT LIABILITY OF SELLER OR THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR
PASSIVE, NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF SELLER.

 



 

15.16 **_WAIVER OF CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER THE DTPA._**

 



 

PURCHASER HEREBY REPRESENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS A "BUSINESS CONSUMER"
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER PROTECTION
ACT (SUBCHAPTER E OF CHAPTER 17 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE (THE "
_TEXAS DTPA_ ")), AND THAT IT HAS ASSETS OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS ($25,000,000) OR MORE ACCORDING TO ITS MOST RECENT FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP OR IS OWNED BY AN ENTITY THAT HAS
ASSETS OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($25,000,000),
AND THAT THEREFORE IT IS NOT A "CONSUMER" FOR PURPOSES OF THE TEXAS DTPA, THAT
IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND THAT IT IS
NOT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DISPARATE BARGAINING POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE
PARTIES TO AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. PURCHASER
HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS DTPA, TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH
PROVISION MAY BE APPLICABLE, AND OF ANY OTHER APPLICABLE DECEPTIVE TRADE
PRACTICES OR CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION OF ANY JURISDICTION, EXCEPT THAT
PURCHASER DOES NOT WAIVE ANY PROVISION FOR

 



      
 

 



 

WHICH, BY EXPRESS PROVISION OF LAW, A WAIVER BY PURCHASER CANNOT BE EFFECTIVE.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 16._** ** _  _****_DISPUTE RESOLUTION_**

 



 

16.1 **_Dispute Resolution._**

 



 

(a) In the event that any Arbitrable Dispute arises, the Parties shall first
seek to resolve such dispute by negotiations as provided in this Article 16
between senior representatives who have authority to settle the controversy. "
_Arbitrable Dispute_ " means (except for: (i) disputes involving Title
Defects, Environmental Defects or any cure relating thereto or involving Title
Benefits, each of which will be resolved as provided in Section 3.2(g) or
Section 4.4(j), as applicable, or (ii) any matters to be resolved by the
Accounting Referee as provided in Section 8.3(b)), any and all disputes,
claims, counterclaims, demands, causes of action, controversies and other
matters in question arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any alleged breach hereof,
including any disputes regarding a Partys indemnification obligations
pursuant to Article 11 or relating to matters that are the subject of this
Agreement or the relationship between the Parties under this Agreement,
regardless of whether (i) extra-contractual in nature, (ii) sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise, (iii) provided for by law or otherwise, or (iv)
any such matters could result in damages or any other relief, whether at law,
in equity or otherwise; but the term " _Arbitrable Dispute_ " does not include
any claim for injunctive relief. Any claim for injunctive relief can only be
sought through a court of competent jurisdiction. The sole and exclusive venue
and forum for any action for injunctive relief brought in connection with this
Agreement is any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in
Harris County, Texas.

 



 

(b) When an Arbitrable Dispute exists, each Party has the right to give the
other Party written notice of the Arbitrable Dispute.

 



 

(c) Senior representatives of the Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable
time and place within fifteen (15) days after a Partys receipt of the notice
of the Arbitrable Dispute in order to exchange relevant information and to
attempt to resolve the matter. If a senior representative intends to be
accompanied to a meeting by an attorney, he or she shall give the other
Partys senior representatives at least three (3) Business Days notice of
such intention so that he or she also can be accompanied by an attorney. If a
Partys senior representative does not meet with the other Partys senior
representative within such fifteen (15) day period, the other Party may, at
such Partys sole option, proceed directly to arbitration under Section 16.2.

 



 

(d) All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written,
made in the course of meetings between senior representatives, by any of the
Parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys and by any CPR
employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose
including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the
Parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable
shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use
in the meetings between senior representatives.

 



      
 

 



 

16.2 **_Arbitration Procedure._**

 



 

(a) Any Arbitrable Dispute not resolved by agreement of the Parties pursuant
to Section 16.1 shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
arbitration using three (3) arbitrators applying by reference the arbitration
rules of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution ("
_CPR_ ") Non-Administered Arbitration Rules, as supplemented by the CPR
Protocol on Disclosure of Documents and Presentation of Witnesses in
Commercial Arbitration (" _CPR Protocol_ "), as currently in effect on the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Rules_ "). If there is any
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Rules, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 



 

(b) Arbitration must be initiated within the applicable time limits set forth
in this Agreement and not thereafter or if no time limit is given in this
Agreement, within the time period allowed by the applicable statute of
limitations; _provided, however,_ that if a Party files a notice of Arbitrable
Dispute within the applicable time limits or limitations period but such
Arbitrable Dispute is not resolved before the expiration of the applicable
time limits or limitations period, the time period for initiating arbitration
for that specific Arbitrable Dispute shall be extended for ninety (90)
calendar days. Arbitration, if initiated, must be initiated by a Party ("
_Claimant_ ") sending written notice on the other Party (" _Respondent_ ")
that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding
arbitration.

 



 

(c) Seller shall appoint one arbitrator and Purchaser shall appoint one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed shall select the third
arbitrator, and failing agreement on selection of the third arbitrator by the
two arbitrators within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the third
arbitrator shall be appointed by the CPR in accordance with the Rules. Each
appointer of the first two arbitrators shall pay the compensation and expenses
of the arbitrator it appoints. Seller shall pay one-half of the compensation
and expenses of the third arbitrator and Purchaser shall pay the other half.
All arbitrators must (i) be neutral persons who have never been officers,
directors, employees, or consultants or had other business or personal
relationships (except acting as arbitrator) with the Parties or any of their
Affiliates, officers, directors or employees and (ii) have experience in or be
knowledgeable about the matters in dispute. The location of all arbitration
proceedings shall be Houston, Texas.

 



 

(d) The Parties and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently so that the award
can be made as promptly as possible. If the amount in controversy is less than
or equal to one million United States Dollars ($1,000,000), the hearing shall
commence within forty-five (45) Business Days after the selection of the third
arbitrator. If the amount in controversy exceeds one million United States
Dollars ($1,000,000), the hearing shall commence at such time as agreed by the
Parties and the arbitrators but no later than three (3) months after the
selection of the third arbitrator. Expedited discovery will be permitted if
and as agreed by the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree, the
arbitrators shall resolve any discovery disputes consistent with the Rules.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the
arbitrators shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. In
rendering any decision or award, the arbitrators must abide by all terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Parties shall each bear their own costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in arbitrating any Arbitrable Dispute.
