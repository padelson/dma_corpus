of all of the directors (other than Mr. Darwin Deason (the " _Stockholder
Party_ "), who abstained), (i) determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the third Business Day (as defined in Section
8.03) after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those
conditions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at
such other time or date as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher
and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Ave., New York, New York 10017, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and
executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Certificate_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.



 

2 SECTION 1.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
the Companys Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company
Class A Common Stock_"), or the Companys Class B Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Company Class B Common Stock_ " and, together with the
Company Class A Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or of any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company or that is directly
or indirectly owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ for the
avoidance of doubt, that no shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a
Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Company shall
be canceled pursuant to this Section 2.01(b).

(c) _Stock Owned by Subsidiaries of the Company_. Each share of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by a Subsidiary which is directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by the Company shall be converted into and become the
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ")
obtained by dividing the dollar value of the Class A Merger Consideration as
of the last Business Day before the date hereof (determined using the closing
price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on such date, as such price
is reported on the screen entitled "Comp/CLOSE/PRICE" for Parent on Bloomberg
L.P. (" _Bloomberg_ ") (or such other source as the parties shall agree in
writing)) by the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on
such date, as such price is reported on the screen entitled "Comp/CLOSE/PRICE"
for Parent on Bloomberg (or such other source as the parties shall agree in
writing).

(d) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

(i) Subject to Section 2.02(e), each share of Company Class A Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding
(x) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (y) shares to be
converted in accordance with Section 2.01(c) and (z) any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive (A) 4.935 (the " _Class A
Exchange Ratio_ ") validly 



 

3  issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Class A Stock Consideration_ ") and (B) $18.60 in cash, without interest (the
" _Class A Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Class A Stock
Consideration, the " _Class A Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Class A Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Class A Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(d) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Class A Certificate_ ")
or book-entry shares (" _Class A Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Class A
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Class A Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), without interest, in
each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Class A Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), in the case of
certificated shares, and automatically, in the case of book-entry shares.

(ii) Subject to Section 2.02(e), each share of Company Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding
(x) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (y) shares to be
converted in accordance with Section 2.01(c) and (z) any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive (A) 4.935 (the " _Class B
Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Class B Stock Consideration_ "), (B) $18.60 in
cash, without interest (the " _Class B Cash Consideration_ "), and (C) a
fraction of a share of a new series of convertible preferred stock to be
issued by Parent at the Effective Time and to be designated as Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the " _Parent
Convertible Preferred Stock_ "), equal to the Preferred Exchange Ratio (the "
_Convertible Preferred Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Class B
Stock Consideration and Class B Cash Consideration, the " _Class B Merger
Consideration_ "), having terms as set forth in the form of Certificate of
Amendment (the " _Certificate of Amendment_ ") attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto.
At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Class B Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.01(d) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "
_Class B Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Class B Book-Entry Shares_ "
and, together with Class A Book-Entry Shares, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Class B Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), without
interest, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Class B Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), in
the case of certificated shares, and automatically, in the case of book-entry
shares. " _Preferred Exchange Ratio_ " means a number equal to (1) 300,000
divided by (2) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(iii) In the event that between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a change in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or 



 

4  Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Class A Exchange Ratio, Class B Exchange Ratio and the conversion related
provisions of the Certificate of Amendment, as applicable, shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such action.

(iv) The right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Class A
Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) shall, to
the extent provided in Section 2.02(j), be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

(v) At the Effective Time, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.04,
all Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 3.01(c)(iii)) issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time under a Company Stock Plan (as defined in
Section 3.01(c)(iii)) shall be assumed by Parent.

(e) _Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to demand and
have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Class A Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration,
as applicable, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights
as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if any
such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively
waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares in respect of which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, at the
Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Class

and Class B Certificates (together, the " _Certificates_ ") and Book-Entry
Shares, book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing shares

the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common
Stock, Parent Convertible Preferred Stock, cash, dividends and distributions
contemplated to be issued and delivered pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.02(c)
out of the Exchange Fund. Except to the extent set forth in Section 2.02(h),
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Certificates._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Class A Merger Consideration or the Class B
Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which

the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary
provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Class A Merger Consideration or the Class B
Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). Each holder of record of one or more
Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate
or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable (i)
the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(d), (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of
record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(d) (after taking into
account 



 

6  all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (iii) shares
of Parent Convertible Preferred Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of
record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(d) (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (iv)
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (v)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and

or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Class A Merger
Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No

in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to

one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Class A Merger Consideration or the
Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) shall automatically

number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(d) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such holder), (iii) shares of Parent Convertible Preferred Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical

the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(d) (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (iv) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (v) cash in lieu of any

has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case until the holder of such
Certificate shall have surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Following the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to
the record holder of the certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock or Parent Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable,
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock or Parent Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable,
and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Convertible
Preferred Stock, as applicable.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares._ Holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Convertible Preferred Stock,

payment of such Parent Common Stock or Parent Convertible Preferred Stock by
the Exchange Agent under Section 2.02(b), the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is

Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) paid upon
the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-
Entry Shares, subject, however, to the 



 

8  Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu
thereof cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
all Certificates surrendered by such holder and all Book-Entry Shares formerly
held by such holder that are converted) would otherwise be entitled by (B)
the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date, as
such price is reported on the screen entitled "Comp/CLOSE/PRICE" on Bloomberg
(or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing).

(f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claim for the Class A Merger Consideration or the
Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) in accordance with this
Article II.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Parent Common Stock, shares of Parent Convertible Preferred
Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions from the Exchange Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to four years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Class A Merger Consideration or Class B
Merger Consideration, as applicable, (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such shares (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant
to Section 2.02(e)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.



 

9 (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of
Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Class A Merger
Consideration or the Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each
case pursuant to this Article II.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

as of the time of its most recent amendment, complied in all material
respects with, to the extent in effect at such time, the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to such Company SEC Document,
and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed or, if amended, as of the

303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its

Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the Company by others within the Company, and to provide

any documents filed or furnished during such period by Parent with the SEC on
a voluntary basis on Current Reports on Form 8-K, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). Each of the Parent SEC Documents, as of the time of its filing or, if
applicable, as of the time of its most recent amendment, complied in all
material respects with, to the extent in effect at such time, the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to such Parent SEC
Document, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed or, if amended, as

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Documents (or incorporated therein by
reference) complied at the time it

obligations incurred after the date hereof not in violation of this Agreement,

hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents or
such Subsidiarys consolidated financial statements or other Parent

and 15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Parent by others within Parent, and to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent have evaluated the
effectiveness of Parents disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in Parents most recent Form 10-K
or Form 10-Q, as applicable, or any amendment thereto, their conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the
end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. The chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of

that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal control over financial reporting.

oral, regarding a deficiency with the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls reasonably likely to lead to
material non-compliance by Parent with GAAP or the Exchange Act,

practices, which such complaint, allegation, assertion or claim was not
publicly disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents or satisfactorily addressed or
otherwise cured and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,

Directors of Parent or any committee thereof.

time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii)

supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting

form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, respectively.

result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section
6.03(a) or (ii) it (and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) fails to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent, Merger
Sub) under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation by the Company._

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
its and their respective directors, officers or employees shall, and the
Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, knowingly initiate or
knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information in connection with, or enter into any agreement with
respect to, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any person
(other than Parent) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction under, or a third
party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL), or
any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (and, to the extent permitted
thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate
any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any person other than
Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions) or (v)
authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the
Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee, if then in existence) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited
after the date hereof in violation of this Section 4.02(a) and was made after
the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.02(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 4.02, (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality 



 

49  agreement not less restrictive to such person than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (excluding paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Confidentiality
Agreement), _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided
to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with
the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent
that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if then in
existence) concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors) that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (or any
communication or affirmation in support of any previously made inquiry,
proposal or offer) from any third party relating to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that
constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of
the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any person would
own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any
resulting parent company of the Company, in each of cases (i) through (iii),
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer from
any third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its
stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity
in a merger) or more than 50% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company),
in each case, which the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee, if then in existence) reasonably determines (after
consultation with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal or offer (including any break-
up fee, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and
financing terms) and the person making the proposal or offer to be (i) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to
any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms set forth in the proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
(including the Special Committee) shall (i) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined in Section 5.01(b)); or (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, a
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement or



 

50 other similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a)) or any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to
compliance with Section 4.02(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may
(A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee, if then in existence) concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and/or (B) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
and take any other action described in the preceding clause (ii), in response
to a Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
through the Special Committee, if then in existence) concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing, at least three Business Days before taking such action, of
its intention to do so and, during such three-Business-Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner such that the failure by the
Board of Directors to take such action would no longer reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Companys notification shall have attached thereto (i) the most current
version of any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of the material terms
of any such proposal and the identity of the offeror if the Company intends to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Takeover
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) a description of the
Intervening Event if the Company intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event.

(d)(i) The obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys
stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Takeover
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 4.02, (A) the
Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of
its stockholders and (B) the Joint Proxy Statement and any and all
accompanying materials (including the proxy card (which shall provide that
signed proxies which do not specify the manner in which the shares of Company
Common Stock subject thereto are to be voted shall be voted "FOR" adopting
this Agreement), the " _Proxy Materials_ ")) shall be identical in form
and content to Proxy Materials that would have been prepared by the Company
had no Company Adverse Recommendation Change been made, except for appropriate
changes to the disclosure in the Joint Proxy Statement stating that such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change has been made and provided that the
Company shall not be obligated to recommend to its stockholders the adoption
of this Agreement or the approval of the Merger at the Company Stockholders
Meeting to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting
through the Special Committee, if then in existence) makes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.



 

51 (e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt) notify Parent
orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, such notice to include the
identity of the person making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of such
Takeover Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in
connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed description of such Takeover Proposal), including any modifications
thereto. The Company shall (x) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof)
of any Takeover Proposal and (y) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of
any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent. 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that (i) compliance
with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect that any such
action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement and (ii) in no event
shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof
(including the Special Committee) take, or agree or resolve to take,
any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

SECTION 4.03. _No Solicitation by Parent._

and their respective directors, officers or employees shall, and Parent shall

encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any Parent Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information in connection with, or enter into any agreement with
respect to, any Parent Takeover Proposal, (iii) waive, terminate, modify or
fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any
person (other than the Company) with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an "interested shareholder" under, Section
912 of the New York Business Corporation Law (the " _BCL_ ")), or any
restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
Parents certificate of incorporation or by-laws, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Parent Takeover Proposal (and, to the extent
permitted thereunder, Parent shall promptly take all steps necessary to
terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any person
other than the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates, under any such
provisions) or (v) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any of, the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative
of 



 

52  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.03(a)
by Parent. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Parent Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Parent
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Parent Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, and which Parent Takeover
Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof in violation of this Section
4.03(a) and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 4.03(a), Parent may, subject to compliance with this
Section 4.03, (x) furnish information with respect to Parent and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Parent Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive to such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (excluding paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement),
_provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to the
Company or is provided to the Company prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such Parent Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Parent Takeover Proposal, if
and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and
(y), the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal advisors) that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

The term " _Parent Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
(or any communication or affirmation in support of any previously made
inquiry, proposal or offer) from any third party relating to, or that could

assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of Parent) or businesses

class of equity securities of Parent or of any resulting parent company of
Parent, in each of cases (i) through (iii), other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

The term " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer
from any third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its

surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or more than 50% of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of Parent), in
each case, which the Board of Directors of Parent reasonably determines
(after consultation with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal or offer (including any break-
up fee, expense reimbursement 



 

53  provisions, conditions to consummation and financing terms) and the person
making the proposal or offer to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of
Parent from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by the Company in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set
forth in the proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof
shall (i) make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; or (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, a merger
agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 4.03(a)) or any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with, any Parent Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and subject to
compliance with Section 4.03(d), the Board of Directors of Parent may (A) make
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and/or (B) make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, and
take any other action described in the preceding clause (ii), in response to a
Parent Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless Parent promptly notifies the
Company, in writing, at least three Business Days before taking such action,
of its intention to do so and, during such three-Business Day period, if
requested by the Company, Parent shall engage in good faith negotiations with
the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner such that the failure by
the Board of Directors to take such action would no longer reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Parents notification shall have attached thereto (i) the most current version
of any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of the material terms of any
such proposal and the identity of the offeror if Parent intends to make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Takeover Proposal
that constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or (ii) a description of the
Intervening Event if Parent intends to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event.

(d)(i) The obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of Parents stockholders on
the Parent Share Issuance at Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited
or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Parent Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Parent
Superior Proposal), or by a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in
any case in which Parent makes a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 4.03, (A) Parent shall nevertheless submit
the Parent Share Issuance to a vote of its stockholders and (B) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any and all accompanying materials (including the proxy
card (which shall provide that signed proxies which do not specify the manner
in which the shares of Parent Common Stock subject thereto are to be voted
shall be 



 

54  voted "FOR" the Parent Share Issuance), the " _Parent Proxy Materials_ "))
shall be identical in form and content to Parent Proxy Materials that would
have been prepared by Parent had no Parent Adverse Recommendation Change been
made, except for appropriate changes to the disclosure in the Joint Proxy
Statement stating that such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change has been made
and provided that Parent shall not be obligated to recommend to its
stockholders the Parent Share Issuance at the Parent Stockholders Meeting to
the extent that the Board of Directors of Parent makes a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(e) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a), (b)
and (c) of this Section 4.03, Parent shall as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within 48 hours after receipt) notify the Company orally and in
writing of any Parent Takeover Proposal, such notice to include the identity
of the person making such Parent Takeover Proposal and a copy of such Parent
Takeover Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in
connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed description of such Parent Takeover Proposal), including any
modifications thereto. Parent shall (x) keep the Company reasonably informed
in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any Parent Takeover Proposal and (y) provide to the
Company as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall not, and
shall cause Parents Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any
person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits Parent from
providing such information to the Company. 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 shall prohibit Parent from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that (i) compliance
with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect that any such
action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement and (ii) in no event
shall Parent or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree
or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.03(b).

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders  Meetings. _

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint
Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating to the
meeting of Parents stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") to
be held to consider the Parent Share Issuance and to the stockholders of the
Company relating to the meeting of the Companys stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider adoption of this Agreement
and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Joint
Proxy 



 

55  Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger and the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the Parent
Convertible Preferred Stock will be convertible. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC), and, prior to
the effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in
any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws
in connection with the Parent Share Issuance, the issuance of the Parent
Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of the Parent Common Stock upon
the conversion of the Parent Convertible Preferred Stock. Each of Parent and
the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by
the other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will made by
Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. The parties shall notify each
other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock or Parent Convertible Preferred Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of all correspondence between any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger. 

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on a date as soon as
reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the Form S-4 solely for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and, if the Board
of Directors of the Company has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or taken any of the actions described in Section 4.02(b)(ii), shall
take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such
stockholders. The Board of Directors of the Company shall make the
Company Recommendation and shall include such Company Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement, and shall not (i) withdraw or modify or qualify (or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to
Parent such recommendation or (ii) make any other public statement in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such 



 

56  recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred
to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ that
the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.02(b). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of this Agreement, the
Companys obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.01(b)
shall, consistent with Section 4.02(d), not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

(c) Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting on a date as soon as reasonably
practicable following the effectiveness of the Form S-4 solely for the purpose
of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and, if the Board of Directors
of Parent has not made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or taken any of
the actions described in Section 4.03(b)(ii), shall take all lawful action to
solicit the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by such stockholders. The
Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend approval of the Parent Share
Issuance by the stockholders of Parent, shall include such recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement (the " _Parent Recommendation_ "), and shall not (i)
withdraw or modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify or
qualify) in any manner adverse to the Company such recommendation or (ii) make
any other public statement in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) or
(ii) being referred to herein as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); _provided_ that the Board of Directors of Parent may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.03(b). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Parents obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.01(c)
shall, consistent with Section 4.03(d), not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent of any Parent
Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Parent Superior Proposal).

(d) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting on the same day at
the same time.

(e) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement (and, in
any event, no later than 24 hours thereafter), Parent shall, in its capacity
as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement for purposes of
the Merger.

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and Contract, each party shall
afford to the other party, and to the other partys officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable
access (including for the purpose of coordinating transition planning with
employees) during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice
during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, personnel and records as the other party may from time to time
reasonably request, and, during such period, such party shall furnish promptly
to the other party (x) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (y) all
other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties
and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. If 



 

57  any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.02
includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party
understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual
understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or information
is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such material or information or its continued protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information provided by either party that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense
doctrine.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to
hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July
22, 2009 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in Section 6 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be inapplicable with respect to any of the
transactions set forth in this Agreement or any proposals or negotiations by
or on behalf of a party expressly permitted by this Agreement (including in
response to a notice pursuant to Section 4.02(c) or Section 4.03(c)). The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided or
received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the
representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
and any other applicable Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (ii) to
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Law, (iii) to use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods with
respect to the approval of the Merger under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, (iv) to use its reasonable best efforts to defend
any Action, whether brought by a Governmental Entity or a third party,
challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (
_provided_ , that nothing in this clause (iv) shall require any party hereto
to agree to any amendment to or waiver under this Agreement), (v) to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, and (vi) to execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



 

58 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including furnishing the other with any written notices or
other communications received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences in
accordance with Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "
_Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Foreign
Antitrust Laws and all other Federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines
and other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition and (B) " _Foreign
Antitrust Laws_ " means the applicable requirements of antitrust competition
or other similar Laws, rules, regulations and judicial doctrines of
jurisdictions other than the United States.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.03(a) and (b), each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law, including using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed). Neither party
shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to
acquire any business, person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to or the consummation of such acquisition would be reasonably likely
to result in not obtaining the applicable clearance, approval or waiver from a
Governmental Entity charged with the enforcement of any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement on any basis whatsoever, or 



 

59  any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to defend against, contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ , that nothing in
this paragraph (d) shall require any party hereto to agree to any amendment to
or waiver under this Agreement).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.03 shall limit (i) a partys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(ii), as
applicable, so long as such party has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Section 5.03, or (ii) a partys
right to take any action contemplated by Sections 4.02 or 4.03.

SECTION 5.04. _Company Stock Options._

(a) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.04, at the Effective Time,
each then outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not exercisable at the
Effective Time, will vest and become immediately exercisable in full and be
assumed by Parent. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement, each Company Stock Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will otherwise continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Company Stock Option (including any applicable award agreement or
other document evidencing such Company Stock Option) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than terms relating to vesting) and be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share
of Company Class A Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(b) Company and Parent agree that prior to the Effective Time, Company shall,
and shall be permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate action
necessary, including, but not limited to, amending any Company Stock Option,
or Company equity award agreement evidencing such award, or Company Stock
Plan, (1) to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.04(a) and (2) to the
extent applicable, to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options,
restricted stock units, or other awards thereunder on or after the
date hereof. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the conversion of any Company Stock Options which (A) are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) provided for
in Section 5.04(a) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code and (B) shall be effected in a manner intended to avoid the
imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

(c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall register the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to Company Stock Options by filing an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form, and
Parent shall maintain the 



 

60  effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements with
respect thereto for so long as such awards remain outstanding. Parent shall
take all action reasonably required (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Company Stock Options. Following the Closing
Date, the Company Stock Plans will be administered by the Compensation
Committee of Parent and Parent may grant equity awards under the Company Stock
Plans to Company employees who continue employment with Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, to the
extent shares are available for grant under any such plan, in accordance with
the mergers and acquisitions exemption to the equity compensation plan
shareholder approval requirement under the NYSE rules.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to take any
of the actions contemplated by this Section 5.04 if, and to the extent that,
such action does not comply with the applicable Law of any foreign
jurisdiction, and the parties shall agree in good faith prior to the
Effective Time on an alternative that is intended to be reasonably comparable,
or to take such other action in respect thereof that the parties agree in good
faith to be appropriate.

SECTION 5.05. _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

(a) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the ESPP) shall adopt such
resolutions and take all other actions necessary so that, without any action
on the part of any participant in the ESPP or any other person (i)
participants in the ESPP shall not be permitted to increase their
payroll deductions under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (ii) no new "Plan Quarter" (as defined in the ESPP) shall start
after the Plan Quarter in which the date of this Agreement occurs, and (iii)
the ESPP shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) _Company Pension Plans_. The Company agrees to take all actions as are
reasonably necessary to effectuate the conversion, as of the Closing, of
Company Common Stock in any Company stock fund under the Company Pension Plans
from Company Common Stock to Parent Common Stock, including,
without limitation, making such amendments, if necessary, as may be required
by any Company Pension Plan, and establishing, in accordance with the
provisions of ERISA and related regulations, such blackout period as may be
required by the applicable third party administrator(s) to effectuate the
conversion.

(c) _Section 280G Calculations_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide Parent with copies
of any documentation as Parent may reasonably request in order to prepare Code
Section 280G calculations in connection with any Company Employees.

(d) _Non-U.S Employee Notifications_. Prior to Closing, the Company agrees to
take such reasonable steps as the Company, in good faith (having discussed
with the Parent), considers to be necessary in respect of applicable notice or
information and consultation requirements regarding any works council, labor
agreements and non-U.S. Law with respect to 



 

61  non-U.S. Company Employees and shall provide to Parent all material details
of the information and consultation in respect of the non-U.S. Company
Employees pursuant to any applicable works council, labor agreements and
non-U.S. Law.

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities as the same exist as of the date hereof,
including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws or any Contract between such directors or officers and the
Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), without further
action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms as of the date hereof.

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper
provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect insurance that is no less
favorable to the Insurance Indemnitees than the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (each such
person, an " _Insurance Indemnitee_ ") (a complete and accurate copy of which
has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable to the Insurance Indemnitees than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
(i) prior to the Effective Time, the Company may substitute therefor and
purchase a single premium tail policy with respect to such directors and
officers liability insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at
least as favorable to the Insurance Indemnitees as the limits, terms and
conditions in the existing policies of the Company; or (ii) if the Company
does not substitute as provided in clause (i) above, then Parent may (A)
substitute therefor policies of Parent, from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier,
containing policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to the
Insurance Indemnitees as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing
policies of the Company or (B) request that the Company obtain such coverage
under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time); _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection with this Section 5.06(c),
neither the Company nor Parent shall pay a one-time premium (in
connection with a single premium tail policy described above) in excess of
the amount set forth in Section 5.06(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
be obligated to pay annual premiums (in connection with any other directors
and officers insurance policy described above) in excess of the annual
premiums set forth in Section 5.06(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. It
is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained
for such amount or less, then the Company and Parent shall be obligated to
obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may be obtained for such amount.



 

62 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
indemnified party and each Insurance Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably

SECTION 5.11.  _Employee Matters._

(a) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on December 31,
2011, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than employees
whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective
bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of which shall be respected by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, who remain in the active employment of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing_  



 

63   _Employees_ ") shall receive compensation and employee benefits, including
severance, that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to the compensation
and employee benefits provided to such employees as of the date of this
Agreement, except for such changes to the compensation and employee benefits
as may be necessary to comply with applicable Law; provided that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have
any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of
any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares
pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; provided, further, that no plans
or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such
issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits
are no less favorable in the aggregate.

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent
with respect to any plans or programs in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Date (i) for purposes of
eligibility for vacation, (ii) for purposes of eligibility and participation
under any defined contribution retirement plan, health or welfare plan (other
than any pension, post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan),
(iii) for purposes of eligibility for and vesting of any company
matching contributions, and (iv) unless covered under another arrangement
with or of the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under any severance plan,
except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative
benefits.

 

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent
such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying
any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent

Continuing Employees who are covered under Company Benefit Plans that are
maintained primarily for the benefit of employees employed in the United
States (including Continuing Employees regularly employed outside the United
States to the extent they participate in such Company Benefit Plans). With
respect to Continuing Employees not described in the preceding sentence,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, comply with all applicable laws, directives and regulations relating to
employees and employee benefits matters applicable to such employees;
provided, however, that prior to December 31, 2011, no changes shall be made
to the terms and conditions of each such Continuing Employees employment
that would give 



 

64  rise to severance obligations under the Laws applicable to such employee
(other than the termination of such employee); provided, further, that nothing
herein shall restrict Parents ability to terminate any Continuing Employee.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or
independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for
in this Section 5.11.

SECTION 5.12. _Takeover Laws_. Each party and its Board of Directors shall (1)
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law (including
Section 203 of the DGCL and Section 912 of the BCL) or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement and (2) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

SECTION 5.13. _Financing._

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and, if entered
into prior to the Closing, the definitive documentation with respect to the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (the " _Definitive Agreements_
"), (ii) negotiate and execute the Definitive Agreements on terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "flex"
provisions thereof) and, upon execution thereof, deliver a copy thereof to the
Company, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and its Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements that
are within its control and comply with its obligations thereunder and not take
or fail to take any action that would be reasonably expected to prevent or
impede or delay the availability of the Financing, (iv) take each of the
actions required of the Company and its Subsidiaries in paragraphs (b)(i)
through (b)(xiii) below with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries, and (v)
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements in
the event of a breach or other failure to fund by the Financing Sources that
impedes or delays the Closing, including by seeking specific performance of
the parties thereunder. In the event that all conditions to the Financing
have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders and the other persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing
on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action to cause such
lenders and other persons to fund such Financing). Parent shall 



 

65  have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements, and/or substitute other debt (but not equity
financing) for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or
alternative financing sources, _provided_ that any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements that amends the Financing
and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Financing shall not (A)
expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the
Commitment Letter, (B) prevent or impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (C)
provide for terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are,
in the aggregate, less favorable to Parent and the Company than those in the
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall be entitled to
substitute debt securities convertible into Parent Common Stock with the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Parent shall be permitted to reduce the amount of Financing under
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements in its reasonable discretion,
_provided_ , that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount
committed below the amount that is required, together with the financial
resources of Parent and Merger Sub, including cash on hand and the proceeds of
loans under existing revolving credit facilities of Parent, to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the payment of the Required Refinancing Indebtedness), and _provided further_
that such reduction shall not (I) expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter, (II) prevent or impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (III) provide for other terms and conditions (including
any "flex" provisions) that are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Parent
and the Company than those in the Commitment Letter. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing unavailable, in each
case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter and
such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of the
Required Refinancing Indebtedness), Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event alternative financing from alternative financing
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the repayment of the
Required Refinancing Indebtedness), _provided_ , that without the prior
written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld), no such
alternative financing (a) shall be equity financing or (b) shall be on terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions and conditions to funding)
that are not, in the aggregate, at least as favorable to Parent and the
Company as those in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall give the Company
prompt oral and written notice (but in any event not later than 48 hours after
the occurrence) of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter
or Definitive Agreements or of any condition not likely to be satisfied, in
each case, of which Parent becomes aware or any termination or waiver,
amendment or other modification of the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreements. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its effort to arrange the
Financing and shall provide to the Company copies of all documents related to
the Financing (excluding fee letters and engagement letters, except to the
extent that such documents contain any conditions to funding, "flex"
provisions or other substantive provisions (excluding provisions related
solely to fees and economic terms agreed to by the parties) regarding the
terms and conditions of the Financing). In the event that Parent commences an
enforcement action to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the
Definitive 



 

66  Agreements and/or cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing (any
such action, a "Financing Action"), Parent shall (x) keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of the Financing Action and (y) at the
request of the Company, shall make Parents employees and Representatives
(other than any of its investment bankers, financial advisors or Financing
Sources) reasonably available to discuss the status of, and material
developments with respect to, the Financing Action.

(b) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
respective Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting,
to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and/or
the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing ( _provided_ that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including, but not limited
to, (i) providing information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Financing Sources (including information to be used in the preparation of
an information package regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of Parent and the Company customary for such
financing or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing by the
Financing Sources) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers for the Financing
and senior management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions
with the rating agencies, (iii) assisting in the preparation of documents and
materials, including, but not limited to, (A) any customary offering
documents, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
(including historical and pro forma financial statements and information) for
any of the Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Financing (including
consenting to the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (v)
executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), customary certificates
(including a certificate of the principal financial officer of the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters
(including consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Financing), legal opinions or other documents and instruments
relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary in connection with
the Financing, (vi) assisting in (A) the preparation of and entering into one
or more credit agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other
agreements or (B) the amendment of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
existing credit agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other
agreements, in each case, on terms satisfactory to Parent and that are
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing; _provided_
 that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Effective Time, (vii) as
promptly as practicable, furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with all
financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing Sources to assist
in preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for 



 

67  the completion of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
(viii) using its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its
independent accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance,
(ix) using its reasonable best efforts to permit any cash and marketable
securities of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be made available to the
Parent and/or Merger Sub at the Closing, (x) providing authorization letters
to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders and containing a representation to the Financing Sources
that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include
material non-public information about the Company or its Affiliates or
securities, (xi) using its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Financing Sources benefit from the existing lending relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (xii) providing audited consolidated financial

any interim period or periods of the Company ended after the date of the most
recent audited financial statements and at least 45 days prior to the Closing
Date (within 45 days after the end of each such period) and (xiii)
cooperating reasonably with Parents Financing Sources due diligence, to the
extent customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering
with the business of the Company;  _provided_ that, until the Effective Time
occurs, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or any
obligation under any credit agreement or any related document or any other
agreement or document related to the Financing (or alternative financing that
Parent may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) or (3) be required to incur any other liability in connection with
the Financing (or any alternative financing that Parent may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) unless
reimbursed or indemnified by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Company;  _provided_ , _further,_ that (I) all non-public or other
confidential information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives
pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential syndicate members during
syndication, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential syndicate members and (II) the Company shall be permitted a
reasonable period to comment on any documents or other information circulated
to potential financing sources that contain or are based upon any such non-
public or other confidential information. Parent (A) shall promptly, upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.13, (B) acknowledges and agrees that the

amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, including as a result
of obtaining alternative financing in accordance with Section 5.13(a), or if
Parent substitutes other debt or equity financing for all or a portion of the
Financing in accordance with Section 5.13(a) 



 

68  (including any debt securities or securities convertible into Parent Common
Stock, in each case, that reduces the amount of the bridge term loan facility
contemplated by the Commitment Letter), each of Parent and the Company shall
comply with its covenants in Section 5.13(a) and (b) with respect to the
Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements, as applicable, as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other
debt or equity financing to the same extent that Parent and the Company would

or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent to such effect.

(d) by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to

76 (d) In the event that after the date hereof, (i) a Takeover Proposal shall
have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly

or 7.01(f)(iv), and (iii) within 12 months after any such termination
referred to in clause (ii) above, the Company enters into a definitive
Contract with respect to, or consummates the transactions contemplated by, any

Proposal referred to in clause (i) above), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds, on the
date of the first to occur of such event(s) referred to above in this clause
(iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" in this Section 7.03(d), references to "15%" shall be
replaced by "50%."

(e) In the event that after the date hereof, (i) a Parent Takeover Proposal
shall have been made to Parent or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of Parent generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known

to breaches of covenants, but not representations and warranties) 7.01(e)(ii),
or 7.01(e)(iv), and (iii) within 12 months after any such termination
referred to in clause (ii) above, Parent enters into a definitive Contract
with respect to, or consummates the transactions contemplated by, any Parent
Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Parent Takeover Proposal is (x)
made before or after termination of this Agreement or (y) is the same Parent
Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (i) above), then Parent shall pay to
the Company the Parent Termination Fee, less the amount of any Vote Down Fee
previously paid by Parent to the Company, by wire transfer of same day funds,
on the date of the first to occur of such event(s) referred to above in this
clause (iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of

pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and all of the conditions to Closing set forth
in Article VI (other than (i) the condition set forth in Section 6.02(d) and
(ii) those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date, but, in the case of clause (ii), which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination) have been
satisfied or waived on or prior to the date of such termination, then Parent
shall pay to the Company a fee in the amount equal to $323 million the ("
_Reverse Breakup Fee_ " and, together with the Company Termination Fee, the
Parent Termination Fee and the Vote Down Fee, the " _Termination Fees_ ")
(which fee shall be payable within two (2) Business Days after such
termination); _provided_ , _however,_ that no Reverse Breakup Fee shall be
payable to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.03(f) if the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 6.02(d) to be satisfied was a result of a
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Each party agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (including Section 7.02), in the event that any Termination Fee is
paid to a party in accordance with this Section 7.03, the payment of such
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party, its
Subsidiaries, shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees
and Representatives against the other party or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates for, and in no event will the party being paid any Termination Fee
or any other such person seek 



 

77  to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim
in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss suffered, directly or
indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (2)
the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating

the party paying such fee, nor any Representative or Affiliate of such party
shall have any further liability or obligation to the other party relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 7.03(f) shall limit the Companys
right to the Parent Termination Fee, less the amount of any Vote Down Fee,
under Section 7.03(e) to the extent that only a Vote Down Fee has been paid to
the Company.

(h) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would enter into this Agreement; accordingly if either
the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company
or Parent, as applicable, for any Termination Fee the Company shall pay to

Company.

SECTION 7.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
and/or the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that (i) after

applicable Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
or further approval by the stockholders of Parent, as applicable, without such
approval having been obtained, (ii) no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement (including Section 5.06) after the Effective Time and (iii)
except as provided by applicable Law, no amendment of this Agreement shall
require the approval of the stockholders of either Parent or the Company. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Except as provided by applicable
Law, no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the
stockholders of either Parent or the Company. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or
partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any
other rights under this Agreement.



 

78 SECTION 7.06. _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04 or Section 7.05 shall, in order to be
effective, require, in the case of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub, action
by its Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof (including,
in the case of the Company, the Special Committee). Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of either the Company or Parent.

84 SECTION 8.09. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction._

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court
of the United States located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual
damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Section 7.03(g) becomes
operative, any Termination Fee paid in accordance with Section 7.03 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the other party to the extent set forth in
Section 7.03(g).

(b) In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any court of the United States located in the
State of Delaware, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim
any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware and (d) consents to service of
process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 8.02.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof). Without limiting other means of
service of process permissible under applicable Law, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set
forth in Section 8.02 shall be effective service of process for any suit or
proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited
to any dispute arising out of or relating to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of



 

85  any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party
would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

SECTION 8.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the extent possible.
