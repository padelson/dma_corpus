           Purchase Price shall be reduced, and the corresponding amount paid to
           the  creditors  set forth on Schedule  1.3 shall be  reduced,  as set
           forth below (each, a "Purchase  Price  Reduction"  and together,  the
           "Purchase Price Reductions"):

            (i)   with  respect to the failure to  represent  and warrant on the
                  Closing  Date the  matters  set  forth in  Section  3.27,  the
                  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to (a)
                  $10,200,000,  less the Closing Three Month Revenue (the "Short
                  Average  Monthly  Revenue  Amount"),  (b) multiplied by twelve
                  (12) (the "Short Average Monthly Revenue Amount Adjustment");

            (ii)  with  respect to the failure to  represent  and warrant on the
                  Closing  Date the  matters  set  forth in  Section  3.28,  the
                  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to (a)
                  $10,200,000,  less  the  Closing  Month  Revenue  (the  "Short
                  Monthly Revenue  Amount"),  (b) multiplied by twelve (12) (the
                  "Short Monthly Revenue Amount Adjustment");

            (iii) with  respect to the failure to  represent  and warrant on the

                  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to (a)
                  $2,355,000, less the Closing Weekly Revenue (the "Short Weekly
                  Revenue Amount"), (b) multiplied by fifty two (52) (the "Short
                  Weekly Revenue Amount  Adjustment" and together with the Short
                  Average  Monthly  Revenue  Amount  Adjustment  and  the  Short
                  Monthly Revenue Amount Adjustment, the "Revenue Purchase Price
                  Reductions"); and

            (iv)  with  respect to the failure to  represent  and warrant on the
                  Closing  Date the  matters  set  forth in  Section  3.30,  the
                  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to (a)
                  $54,500,000,  less the Closing  Inventory (net of 30-days past
                  due) (the "Short  Inventory  Amount"),  (b)  multiplied by 1.5
                  (such  adjustment  being  referred to as the "Short  Inventory
                  Amount Adjustment").

Each Purchase Price Reduction (whether such Purchase Price Reduction is a
Revenue Purchase Price Reduction or a Short Inventory Amount Adjustment, or
both) shall be aggregated with all other Purchase Price Reductions, and the
Purchase Price shall correspondingly be reduced; provided, however, that in the
event more than one Revenue Purchase Price Reduction shall be required under
this Section 1.3(b), with respect to such Revenue Purchase Price Reductions,
only the highest adjustment of the applicable Revenue Purchase Price Adjustments
shall be made.

     (c)   Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 1.3(b) above, in the event
           that any of (i) the Closing  Three Month Revenue shall be equal to or
           less than $10,000,000,  (ii) the Closing Month Revenue shall be equal
           to or less than  $10,000,000,  (iii) the Closing Weekly Revenue shall
           be equal to or less than  $2,350,000,  (iv) or the Closing  Inventory
           shall be equal to or less than  $53,500,000,  then,  at the option of
           Acquiror,  Acquiror may terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section
           7.1(i).

1.4 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be allocated in
accordance with Schedule 1.4. After the Closing Date, the Company, the Operating
Subsidiaries and the Acquiror shall each make consistent use of the allocation,
fair market value and amortization specified in Schedule 1.4 for all tax
purposes and in any and all filings, declarations and reports with the Internal
Revenue Service in respect thereof, including the reports required to be filed
under Section 1060 of the Code, if applicable, it being understood that the
Company, the Operating Subsidiaries and the Acquiror will prepare and file their
respective asset acquisition statements on Form 8594 and, if required by Section
1060 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder, their respective
supplemental asset acquisition statements on Form 8594 in accordance with
Schedule 1.4. In any proceeding relating to the determination of any Tax,
neither the Acquiror nor the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries shall contend
or represent that such allocation is not a correct allocation.

     (a)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

           accrued,  known or unknown,  that are  attributable  to the  periods,
           events or  circumstances  after the  Closing  Date,  and which  arise
           under,  relate  to or are in  connection  with  the  ownership,  use,
           possession,  enjoyment  or  operation of the Assets after the Closing
           Date (the "Assumed  Liabilities").  The Acquiror, the Company and the
           Operating  Subsidiaries  shall  each enter  into the  Assignment  and

           expressly  understood  and agreed that the Acquiror shall assume only
           the Assumed  Liabilities  and,  except for the  Assumed  Liabilities,

           have prior to the  Closing  Date with the giving of notice or passage
           of time);  (ii) any  liabilities  or  obligations of any Person other
           than the  Company  or any of the  Operating  Subsidiaries;  (iii) any

           accounts  of  such  Stores,  are  included  as so  set  forth  in the
           consolidated   financial   statements   of  the   Company   for   the
           corresponding  periods and have been reported in a manner  consistent
           with  the  Company's  financial  reporting   accounting   principles.
           Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the DPI  revenue  set  forth on the
           Profit and Loss  Statements  reflects net  commissions.  The expenses
           reflected  on the  Profit and Loss  Statements  are  included  in the
           consolidated   financial   statements   of  the   Company   for   the
           corresponding periods and are consistent with the Company's financial
           reporting  accounting  principles,  subject  to such  changes  due to
           reclassifications  that occur in the ordinary  course of business and
           are not material with respect to the operation of the Stores.

     (b)   The balance sheet  information  set forth on Schedule 3.6(b) for each
           of the Stores has been  derived from the  accounting  records of each
           Store and fairly  presents the  information set forth thereon for the
           date  provided.  Such  information  is included  in the  consolidated
           financial statements of the Company as of the date referenced thereon
           and  reflects  accounting  treatment  consistent  with the  Company's
           financial reporting accounting principles.

     (c)   Except  as  set  forth  in  the  Company's   Consolidated   Financial
           Statements, the Profit and Loss Statements or on Schedule 3.6(c), the
           Assets  are  not  subject  to  any  liability,  commitment,  debt  or
           obligation (of any kind  whatsoever  whether  absolute or contingent,
           accrued,  fixed, known or unknown,  matured or unmatured)  (together,
           "Undisclosed Liabilities").

           in the aggregate, are not material;

     (f)   any waiver or release by the Company or any  Operating  Subsidiary of
           any right of any material value relating to the Assets;

     (g)   any material adverse change in the business,  operations,  prospects,
           assets or results of  operations  or  condition  of the Stores or the
           Assets,  and no event has  occurred or  circumstance  exists that may
           result in such a material adverse change;

     (h)   any change in the  accounting  policies with respect to the Stores as

other contamination which may give rise to liability to the Company or any
Operating Subsidiary, as owner or operator of the Stores, for clean up or a
required response action or which under any Store Leases may impose liability on
the operator of the Stores for such liability.

3.18 Motor Vehicles and Equipment. Set forth on Schedule 3.18 is a list of the

           similar  group of which the  Company is or was a member (a  "Relevant
           Group") has filed with the  appropriate  taxing  authorities  all Tax
           Returns required to be filed prior to the date hereof,  and will file

           Returns  the  filing of which is  necessary  for the  conduct  of the

           employees  and  has  timely  paid  or  will  cause  to be paid to the
           appropriate  Governmental Authorities proper and accurate amounts for
           all  periods  through  the  date  hereof  and  the  Closing  Date  in

                  Plans"),  excluding  any such plan,  program,  arrangement  or
                  funding  arrangement  as to which the  Company is not (and has
                  not  been) a  participating  employer  and has no  current  or
                  potential liability under the Code or ERISA.

     (b)   The Company has listed on Schedule  3.24(b)  hereto and has delivered
           to the Acquiror  true and  complete  copies of any  applications  for
           Private  Letter  Rulings made to the IRS and any  responses  received
           from the IRS regarding the same.

     (c)   One or more of the Company  Employee  Benefit Plans may be covered by
           COBRA.  If so,  each  such  Company  Employee  Benefit  Plan has been
           operated  in,  and is  in,  compliance  with  COBRA  in all  material
           respects.  To the  knowledge of the Company  after due  inquiry,  all
           notices  required  to be given  under  COBRA  for each  such  Company
           Employee  Benefit  Plan  have  been  timely  and  properly  given  in
           accordance  with  COBRA,  and the rules and  Regulations  promulgated
           thereunder.  No employee,  former employee or "qualified beneficiary"
           (as defined in COBRA) has any claim or  contingent  claim against the
           Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate
           for failure to comply with COBRA or the rules and Company Regulations
           promulgated  thereunder.  The  Company  has not  communicated  to any
           employee or former employee any intention or commitment to modify any
           Company  Employee Benefit Plan or to establish or implement any other
           employee or retiree benefit or compensation plans or arrangements.

3.25 Broker's Fees. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.25, neither the Company
nor anyone on its behalf has any liability to any broker, finder, investment
banker or agent, or has agreed to pay any brokerage fees, finder's fees or
commissions, or to reimburse any expenses of any broker, finder, investment
banker or agent in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

3.26 Solvency.

     (a)   The  Company  and  each  of the  Operating  Subsidiaries  is not  now
           Insolvent  and will not be  rendered  insolvent  by the  transactions
           contemplated  hereby. As used herein,  "Insolvent" means that the sum
           of the debtor's Debts is greater than all of the debtor's assets at a
           fair valuation.

     (b)   Immediately   after  giving  effect  to  the   consummation   of  the
           transactions  contemplated  hereby:  (i) the  Company and each of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries will be able to pay their liabilities as they
           become due in the usual course of its business;  (ii) the Company and
           each of the Operating  Subsidiaries will not have unreasonably  small
           capital  with which to conduct  their  present or proposed  business;
           (iii) the Company and each of the  Operating  Subsidiaries  will have
           assets (calculated at fair market value) that exceed its liabilities;
           and (iv) taking into account all pending and  threatened  litigation,
           final  judgments  against the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  in
           actions  for  money  damages  are not  reasonably  anticipated  to be
           rendered at a time when, or in amounts such that,  the Company or any
           of the  Operating  Subsidiaries  will be unable to  satisfy  any such
           judgments  promptly  in  accordance  with their  terms  (taking  into
           account the maximum  probable  amount of such  judgments  in any such
           actions  and the  earliest  reasonable  time at which such  judgments
           might be  rendered) as well as all other  obligations  of the Company
           and each of the  Operating  Subsidiaries.  The cash  available to the
           Company and each of the  Operating  Subsidiaries,  after  taking into
           account all other anticipated uses of the cash, will be sufficient to
           pay all such Debts and judgments  promptly in  accordance  with their
           terms.

election, terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms set forth in Section

capacities) in connection herewith (whether prior to, on, or after the date
hereof) contains or will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state or will state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained herein correct and therein not misleading. There is no fact known to
the Company or any of the Operating Subsidiaries that materially and adversely
affects the use or enjoyment of, or title to the Assets, which has not been set

           with the other party in advance and, to the extent  permitted by such
           Governmental  Authority,  give the  other  party the  opportunity  to
           attend  and  participate   therein,   in  each  case  to  the  extent
           practicable;  (vi) subject to any restrictions  under antitrust Laws,

           filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions of the HSR Act.

     (b)   Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Acquiror, the Company and the
           Operating  Subsidiaries  agree to cooperate and use all  commercially
           reasonable  efforts to  contest  and  resist  any  action,  including
           administrative  or  judicial  action,  and to have  vacated,  lifted,
           reversed or overturned any Order (whether  temporary,  preliminary or
           permanent) of any Court or Governmental  Authority that is or becomes
           in effect and that restricts,  prevents or prohibits the consummation
           of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement;   provided,
           however,  that nothing  contained  in this  Agreement  shall  require
           Acquiror  to  enter  into  a  divestiture,   hold-separate,  business
           limitation  or  similar   agreement  or   undertaking   which  would,
           individually  or in the  aggregate,  in  the  judgment  of  Acquiror,
           adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Acquiror of the
           transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  the  ability  of
           Acquiror to conduct  its  business  substantially  in the manner such
           business is being conducted as of the date of this Agreement.

     (c)  (i)     Subject  to the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  each of the
                  Company, the Operating Subsidiaries and the Acquiror will give
                  (or will  cause  their  respective  Subsidiaries  to give) any
                  notices to third persons,  and use, and cause their respective
                  subsidiaries to use, all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
                  obtain any consents from third persons (A)  necessary,  proper
                  or advisable to consummate the  transactions  contemplated  by
                  this  Agreement,  (B) otherwise  required under any contracts,
                  licenses,  leases or other  agreements in connection  with the
                  consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby, or (C)
                  required  to prevent a material  adverse  effect on the Stores
                  from occurring  prior to the Closing Date. The Company and the
                  Operating  Subsidiaries shall notify Acquiror promptly, but in
                  no event  later  than two (2) days,  following  receipt of the
                  consent contemplated by Section 5.2(d) hereof. --------------

            (ii)  If the  Company or the  Operating  Subsidiaries  shall fail to
                  obtain any consent described in Section 4.2(c)(i) above from a
                  third person, the Company and the Operating  Subsidiaries will
                  use all  reasonable  efforts,  and will take any such  actions
                  reasonably requested by Acquiror,  to limit the adverse effect
                  upon the Acquiror  and its  Subsidiaries  resulting,  or which
                  would  result  after the  Closing  Date,  from the  failure to
                  obtain  such  consent  and will  cooperate  in good faith with
                  Acquiror to develop an alternative  arrangement to ensure that
                  Acquiror  obtains the  benefits  consistent  with the economic
                  results intended by this Agreement.

4.3 No Solicitations.

     (a)   Neither  the  Company nor any of the  Operating  Subsidiaries  shall,
           directly or  indirectly,  through any  officer,  director,  employee,
           representative  or agent  solicit or encourage  (including  by way of
           furnishing  any   information   or  assistance)   the  initiation  or
           submission  of any  inquiries,  proposals  or offers  from any person
           regarding the sale of any of the Assets to be sold to Acquiror hereby
           (other  than as  permitted  by  Section  4.1(a)),  whether  or not in
           writing  and  whether or not  delivered  to the Company or any of its
           Subsidiaries   generally  (an  "Acquisition   Proposal");   provided,
           however,  that nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
           Board  of  Directors   of  the  Company  or  any  of  the   Operating
           Subsidiaries  from referring any third party to this Section 4.3. The
           Company and the Operating Subsidiaries further agree that neither the
           Company,  the  Operating  Subsidiaries  nor any of  their  respective
           officers or directors  shall, and that they shall each direct and use
           their   best   efforts   to  cause   their   employees,   agents  and
           representatives   (including  any  investment  banker,   attorney  or
           accountant retained by the Company or any Operating Subsidiaries) not
           to, directly or indirectly,  enter into negotiations  concerning,  or
           provide  any  confidential  information  or  data  to,  or  have  any
           discussions with, any person relating to an Acquisition  Proposal, or
           otherwise  facilitate  any effort or attempt to make or  implement an
           Acquisition Proposal.

     (b)   The Company  shall  immediately  notify the  Acquiror  after  receipt
           (after the date  hereof) of any  Acquisition  Proposal or any request
           for  nonpublic  information  relating  to the  Company  or any of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
           for access to the properties,  books or records of the Company or any
           of the Operating  Subsidiaries that informs the Board of Directors of
           the  Company  that  it  is  considering   making,  or  has  made,  an
           Acquisition  Proposal.  The Company also agrees that it will promptly
           request each person that has  heretofore  executed a  confidentiality
           agreement  in  connection  with any such  person's  consideration  of
           acquiring  any of the Assets to return all  confidential  information
           heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of it.

     (c)   The  Company  agrees that it will  immediately  cease and cause to be
           terminated any existing activities,  discussions or negotiations with
           any  parties  conducted   heretofore  with  respect  to  any  of  the
           foregoing.  The Company agrees that it will take the necessary  steps
           to promptly inform the  individuals or entities  referred to above of
           the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3.

4.4 Press Releases. The Company, the Operating Subsidiaries and the Acquiror
will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press releases or other public
statements with respect to any transactions described in this Agreement, and
shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation.

4.5 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

     (a)   The  parties  acknowledge  that the  Acquiror  and the  Company  have
           entered  into  that  certain   confidentiality   and   non-disclosure
           agreement,   dated  as  of  November  16,   2002,   as  amended  (the
           "Confidentiality Agreement"), which will terminate upon the execution
           of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the parties shall
           remain  liable in  accordance  with the terms of the  Confidentiality
           Agreement as if such  agreement  remained in effect for breaches,  if
           any, thereunder occurring prior to the date hereof.

     (b)   Each of the  Company,  the  Operating  Subsidiaries  and the Acquiror
           will, and will cause their respective officers, directors, employees,
           agents  and  representatives  to  (i)  hold  in  confidence,   unless
           compelled  to disclose by  judicial or  administrative  process or by
           other requirements of Law, all nonpublic  information  concerning the
           other  party   furnished   in   connection   with  the   transactions
           contemplated  by this Agreement  until such time as such  information
           becomes publicly  available  (otherwise than through the wrongful act
           of such person) and (ii) not release or disclose such  information to
           any other  person,  except in connection  with this  Agreement to its
           auditors,  attorneys,   financial  advisors,  other  consultants  and
           advisors.  In the  event of  termination  of this  Agreement  for any
           reason,  the  parties  hereto  will  promptly  return or destroy  all

           of the Company and the Operating  Subsidiaries relating to the Assets
           and the  operation  of the Stores,  will permit the  Acquiror to make
           such  inspections  as the  Acquiror may  reasonably  require and will
           cause the Company's officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish
           the  Acquiror  with  such  financial  and  operating  data and  other
           information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of
           the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  relating  to the  Assets and the
           Stores  as the  Acquiror  may from time to time  reasonably  request,
           provided that no investigation  pursuant to this Section 4.5(c) shall
           affect  or  be  deemed  to  modify  any  of  the  representations  or
           warranties  made by the Company or any of the Operating  Subsidiaries
           and   each   representation   and   warranty   shall   survive   such
           investigation.

     (d)   Between  the date hereof and the  Closing  Date,  the Company and the
           Operating Subsidiaries will provide the firms retained by Acquiror to

           representatives,  reasonable  access during normal  business hours to
           all employees,  offices,  warehouses and other  facilities and to all
           books  and  records  of the  Company  and  each of its  Subsidiaries,
           including the Operating  Subsidiaries,  and will permit such firms to
           make such  inspections as reasonably  required in order to obtain the
           information   necessary  to  render  the  Solvency  Opinion  and  the
           Reasonably  Equivalent  Value  Opinion.  The  Company  will cause its
           officers  and those of its  Subsidiaries  to furnish  such firms with
           such financial and operating data and other  information with respect
           to the financial  condition,  business,  operations and properties of
           the Company and its  Subsidiaries as such firms may from time to time
           reasonably  request  in the  course  of  their  investigation.  It is
           expressly  understood  among the  parties  that  during the course of
           their  engagement and at any time  thereafter,  the firms retained by
           Acquiror  to  deliver  the  Solvency   Opinion  and  the   Reasonably
           Equivalent Value Opinion will not provide confidential information of
           the   Company   or  any  of  its   Subsidiaries   to  the   Acquiror.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, such firms will be permitted to review
           such aspects of the confidential information as they deem appropriate
           in their professional  judgment and report to the Acquiror concerning
           their  satisfaction  with the results of such review on rendering the
           opinions  to  Acquiror  contemplated  by Section  4.7 and Section 4.8
           without  disclosing  the  content  of  the  confidential  information
           reviewed by them to Acquiror.

     (e)   Between  the date  hereof and the Closing  Date,  the  Company  shall
           furnish to the Acquiror no later than one (1) business day  following
           delivery  thereof  to  management  of the  Company,  such  weekly and

           or  otherwise)  relating  to  the  operation  of  the  Stores  as are
           regularly prepared for distribution to Company management.

4.6 Notice of Developments.

     (a)   Prior to the Closing Date,  each of the parties hereto shall promptly
           notify the other in writing of all events,  circumstances,  facts and
           occurrences,  whether  arising  prior to or subsequent to the date of
           this Agreement,  that will or are reasonably  likely to result in any
           breach  of a  representation  or  warranty  or  covenant  made by the
           notifying  party in this  Agreement or in any failure to be satisfied
           of any  condition  to the  obligations  of the party  receiving  such
           notice under this Agreement.

     (b)   Should any event, circumstance, fact or occurrence relating to events
           after the date hereof require any change to any Schedule  provided by
           the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries hereunder,  the Company and
           the  Operating  Subsidiaries  shall  promptly  deliver to  Acquiror a
           supplement to such Schedule (a "Schedule Supplement") specifying such
           change. Upon receipt of any such Schedule Supplement,  Acquiror shall
           have ten (10) days from  delivery  of each such  Schedule  Supplement
           (each,  a "Supplement  Review  Period") to review the contents of and
           disclosures  in each such  Schedule  Supplement  and to  request  and
           receive any additional information from the Company and the Operating
           Subsidiaries  relating to the contents and  disclosures  contained in
           such  Schedule  Supplement.  At any time  through and  including  the
           Supplement Review Period, Acquiror shall have the right to notify the
           Company and the Operating  Subsidiaries  whether it elects to proceed
           with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to terminate
           this  Agreement.  In the  event  Acquiror  elects to  terminate  this
           Agreement, the provisions of Article VII ----------- shall govern and
           apply for all purposes. The termination of this Agreement by Acquiror
           pursuant  to this  Section  4.6(b) as a result of receipt of any such
           Schedule Supplement which would cause a representation --------------
           or warranty of the Company or the  Operating  Subsidiaries  to become
           untrue  shall  not  be  or be  deemed  to be a  termination  of  this
           Agreement to which the provisions of Section  7.3(a)  refers.  In the
           event that ---------------  Acquiror does not elect to terminate this
           Agreement  during  the  Supplement  Review  Period  as  a  result  of
           receiving  any  such  Schedule  Supplement,  then  Acquiror  shall be
           prohibited  from seeking  indemnification  under Section  8.2(a) with
           respect to the  specific  breach of the  representation  and warranty
           resulting  ---------------  from  the  information  included  on such
           Schedule  Supplement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no delivery of
           any Schedule Supplement pursuant to this Section 4.6(b) will cure any
           breach  of  any  representation  or  --------------  warranty  of the
           Company or any Operating  Subsidiary contained in this Agreement made
           as of the date  hereof  or  otherwise  limit or affect  the  remedies
           available hereunder to Acquiror with respect to such breach.

4.7 Solvency Opinion. Acquiror shall obtain a solvency opinion in the form and
substance satisfactory to the Acquiror from a firm selected by the Acquiror
providing that the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries are not Insolvent and
will not be rendered Insolvent by the transactions contemplated hereby and
otherwise addressing the items referenced in Section 3.26(b) as Acquiror deems
appropriate (the "Solvency Opinion"). The Solvency Opinion shall permit the
Company and the Operating Subsidiaries to reasonably rely thereon, and upon
receipt, Acquiror shall provide a copy of the Solvency Opinion to the Company
and the Operating Subsidiaries. The Company shall promptly reimburse the
Acquiror for the fees of such firm providing the Solvency Opinion up to an
aggregate amount that, together with the fees for the Reasonably Equivalent
Value Opinion, does not exceed $500,000; provided, however, that at Acquiror's
election, such aggregate fee amount may be credited against the Creditor Payment
at Closing or against the Holdback Account.

4.8 Reasonably Equivalent Value Opinion. The Acquiror shall obtain a written
opinion in the form and substance satisfactory to the Acquiror, from a firm
selected by Acquiror providing that the Purchase Price being paid by Acquiror
hereunder (taking into account the potential adjustments to the Purchase Price
contained in Section 1.3(b)) for the sale of the Assets hereunder by the Company
and the Operating Subsidiaries meets or exceeds the reasonably equivalent value
of such Assets (the "Reasonably Equivalent Value Opinion"). The Reasonably
Equivalent Value Opinion shall permit the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries
to reasonably rely thereon, and upon receipt, Acquiror shall provide a copy of
the Reasonably Equivalent Value Opinion to the Company and the Operating
Subsidiaries. The Company shall promptly reimburse the Acquiror for the fees of
such firm providing the Reasonably Equivalent Value Opinion up to an aggregate
amount that, together with the fees for the Solvency Opinion, does not exceed
$500,000; provided, however, that at Acquiror's election, such aggregate fee
amount may be credited against the Creditor Payment at Closing or against the
Holdback Account.

4.9 Employees. The Acquiror shall not assume the liability of the Company or the
Operating Subsidiaries with respect to the employees for accrued but unpaid
salaries (including deferred compensation), wages, vested vacation and sick pay,
workers compensation claims, health benefit claims, employer contributions to a
Company Employee Benefit Plan (including restorative payments) or incentive
compensation, and the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries shall remain
responsible for the payment of all the foregoing items through the date that is
the earlier of (a) the date of termination of such employee, or (b) the last day
of the Transition Period (the "Employee Termination Date"), such payment to be
made as soon as practicable after the Employee Termination Date or when such
payment would otherwise be due, but in no event later than five (5) business
days following the Employee Termination Date; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plans to the contrary,
the Company shall remit to each of its and its Operating Subsidiaries' Store
employees, salary in the amount equal to such employee's accrued but unpaid
vacation as of such employee's Employee Termination Date. The Company and the
Operating Subsidiaries shall also remain responsible for payment of any and all
retention, change in control or other similar compensation or benefits which are
or may become payable to the employees in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, any severance payments or
other such obligations to employees in accordance with the terms of the Company
Employee Benefit Plans.

days prior to the Closing Date, Acquiror shall provide a list to the Company and
the Operating Subsidiaries designating which Assets acquired hereunder will be

and the Operating Subsidiaries shall execute all documents necessary to
transfer, upon the Closing, such Assets to such designated Acquiror
Subsidiaries.

4.11 Acquiror Due Diligence Period. Acquiror shall have the right to conduct due
diligence and shall be entitled to review the books, records and operations of
the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries and to receive from the Company and
any of the Operating Subsidiaries any and all financial, legal and other
information necessary in completing its due diligence investigation of the
Assets being acquired hereunder. On the fourteenth (14th) date following the
date hereof (the "Initial Investigation Period"), Acquiror shall evaluate the
status of its due diligence investigation, and the Acquiror, the Company and the
Operating Subsidiaries shall mutually agree on a reasonable period of no less
than six (6) days in which Acquiror shall be entitled to complete its due
diligence investigation following such fourteen (14) day period; provided,
however, that in the event the parties are unable to agree on a reasonable
period prior to the conclusion of such fourteen (14) day period, such fourteen
(14) day period shall be extended for six (6) days (such extended period as
agreed upon among the parties, or if no agreement among the parties is reached,
such six (6) day period being herein referred to as the "Extended Investigation
Period" and, together with the Initial Investigation Period, the "Due Diligence
Period"). In the event the last day of the Due Diligence Period shall fall on a
day that is not a Business Day, the next following Business Day shall be the
last day of the Due Diligence Period.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                             POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

6.1 Apportionment. The Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to all income earned in or from the ownership or operation
of the Assets with respect to events occurring prior to and on the Closing Date,
and the Acquiror will be entitled to all income earned in or from the ownership
or operation of the Assets with respect to events occurring after the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all cash receipts
received at the Stores on or prior to the Closing Date shall be the property of
the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and all cash
receipts received at the Stores after the Closing Date shall be the property of
the Acquiror. The parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other to ensure
that any amounts received are delivered to the party entitled to such amounts as
provided herein. All property taxes, rent, utilities and amounts under the Store
Leases shall be apportioned on an accrual basis as of the close of business on
the Closing Date between Acquiror, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries
such that Acquiror shall be responsible only for property taxes, rent, utilities
and amounts under the Store Leases with respect to periods occurring after the
Closing Date.

6.2 License to Use Name. From and after the Closing, the Company shall grant to
the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for a 30-day transition period a
non-exclusive, royalty-free license (the "License") to use the names "Rent-Way,"
"Home Choice" and "Rentavision" (collectively, the "Company Names"), but only in
connection with the business conducted by the Acquiror at the Stores. The
License is granted strictly on a non-exclusive basis, and in this regard, the
Company shall, after the Closing, have all rights to use and to grant and
license to others the right to use the Company Names in whole or in part, in any
location and in any manner whatsoever, subject to the terms of the
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement. The Acquiror acknowledges that
as of the Closing it will have no property rights in and to the Company Names
other than the License specifically granted herein and will not use the Company
Names except pursuant to this Agreement. The License shall not be sublicensed or
assigned by the Acquiror in any manner, except that the Acquiror may assign the
License to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (i) in
connection with a transfer of some or all of the operations to such entity and
(ii) in connection with the matters as contemplated by Section 4.10 hereof (such
entities together being referred to as a "Permitted Transferee") provided that
prior to such transfer, the Permitted Transferee agrees to be bound by the
provisions of the License and the Acquiror and the Acquiror continue to be
liable for breach of the License by the Permitted Transferee.

6.3 Account Store Acquisition Option. For a period of thirty (30) days from the
date immediately following the Closing Date (the "Transition Period"), Acquiror
shall be entitled, upon delivery of written notice to the Company or the
Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may be (an "Additional Store Notice"), to
assume from the Company and any of the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, the real estate lease (and the fixtures related thereto) at no additional
cost for any of the Account Stores. In the event Acquiror exercises its rights
under this Section 6.3, Acquiror, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries
shall enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to such
real estate lease containing terms reasonably satisfactory to the parties and
including terms at a minimum of which, shall provide that Acquiror shall only
assume the obligations of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries under such
real estate lease for obligations attributable to periods following such
assumption.

6.4 Transition Period; Access to Stores; Cooperation.

     (a)   With  respect to each  Account  Store,  the  Company  and each of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries  will  provide  access to each of the Account
           Stores through the Transition Period. Neither the Company, any of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries nor any of their representatives shall remove
           any vehicles,  fixtures, equipment or any other item from the Account
           Stores  during the  Transition  Period.  The  Company and each of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries  shall reasonably  cooperate with Acquiror in
           the  transition  of the Assets and business  operations  to Acquiror,
           including without limitation, providing staffing of the Company's and
           its  Operating  Subsidiaries'  employees  to Acquiror  sufficient  to
           permit the transition of such Account Store  operations.  The Company
           and the Operating  Subsidiaries  acknowledge  that all such personnel
           utilized  shall be the  employees  of the  Company  or the  Operating
           Subsidiaries,  as the case may be (the "Transition  Personnel").  The
           duties of the Transition  Personnel shall include without  limitation
           (i)  the  winding  down of the  business  operations  of the  Account
           Stores,  (ii) the  transfer of  inventory  and  customer  accounts to
           designated  stores  of  the  Acquiror,  (iii)  the  transitioning  of
           customer  relationships to such Acquiror stores, (iv) assistance with
           respect to the conversion of customer  account records of the Account
           Stores  to  Acquiror's  computer  information  system,  and (v) other
           similar type duties.

     (b)   The  Company  and the  Operating  Subsidiaries  shall be jointly  and
           severally  liable for, and will each indemnify the Acquiror for, only
           the costs, expenses and liabilities attributable to the operation and
           transition  of the Account  Stores  during the  Transition  Period as
           follows:

            (i)   rent, utilities and all obligations,  expenses and liabilities
                  under the leases  underlying  the  Account  Stores  during the
                  Transition Period;

            (ii)  lease and related costs  applicable to office equipment in the
                  Account Stores during the Transition  Period (other than costs
                  of printer cartridges,  paper and other consumables associated
                  with  the  operation  of  such   equipment,   which  shall  be
                  Acquiror's responsibility);

            (iii) the  costs  associated  with  vehicles  owned or leased by the
                  Company  or any of the  Operating  Subsidiaries  and  used  in
                  connection  with the Account  Stores (other than fuel costs in
                  excess of the costs of fuel in such vehicles as of the Closing
                  Date),  including lease costs, insurance costs and maintenance
                  costs; and

            (iv)  employee payroll, health and other employee benefits,  workers
                  compensation claims, health care claims,  employment practices
                  claims (including without limitation,  termination and related
                  claims) and all other costs,  expenses and liabilities related
                  to the Transition Personnel;  provided, however; that Acquiror
                  shall  be   responsible   for   liabilities   (a)  related  to
                  third-party injury claims (other than employees of the Company
                  or  its  Subsidiaries,  including  the  Transition  Personnel)
                  arising out of the  operation of the Account  Stores,  and (b)
                  liabilities   relating  to  intentional   acts  by  Transition
                  Employees  that are directed by Acquiror  and that  constitute
                  violation of  applicable  Law.  The Company and the  Operating
                  Subsidiaries shall maintain  sufficient  insurance coverage to
                  cover applicable risks relative to the foregoing.  At any time
                  through  the  Transition   Period,   the  Acquiror  may  offer
                  employment to such  employees of the Company and the Operating
                  Subsidiaries  at the Stores as the Acquiror shall determine in
                  its sole discretion at wage or salary levels acceptable to the
                  Acquiror,  and with employee  benefits that are  acceptable to
                  the Acquiror.

         Acquiror shall be responsible for all other costs in connection with
the operation of the Account Stores during the Transition Period, such as
advertising costs, office equipment consumables referenced above, fuel charges
referenced above and office supplies.

6.5 Leased Employees. With respect to the Acquired Stores, the Company and the
Operating Subsidiaries shall lease to Acquiror through the Transition Period
such employees of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries as may be designated
by Acquiror. Such employees shall at all times remain the employees of the
Company or the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may be (the "Leased
Employees"). The Company and the Operating Subsidiaries shall be jointly and
severally liable for, and will each indemnify the Acquiror for, all costs,
expenses and liabilities of such Leased Employees, including without limitation,
employee payroll, health and other employee benefits, workers compensation
claims, health care claims, employment practices claims (including without
limitation, termination and related claims) and all other costs, expenses and
liabilities related to such Leased Employees attributable to the Transition
Period; provided, however, that Acquiror shall be responsible only for
liabilities (i) related to third-party injury claims (other than employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the Transition Personnel) arising out
of the operation of the Account Stores, and (ii) liabilities relating to
intentional acts by Transition Employees that are directed by Acquiror and that
constitute violation of applicable Law. At any time through the Transition
Period, the Acquiror may offer employment to such employees of the Company and
the Operating Subsidiaries at the Stores as the Acquiror shall determine in its
sole discretion at wage or salary levels acceptable to the Acquiror, and with
employee benefits that are acceptable to the Acquiror.

6.6 Tax Matters. The Company shall be responsible for the timely payments of,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror against, all sales
(including, without limitation, bulk sales), use, value added, documentary,
stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance, excise, recording,
firearm, ammunition, license and other similar taxes and fees ("Transfer
Taxes"), arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall prepare and
timely file all tax returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes;
provided, however, that the Acquiror shall be permitted to prepare any such Tax
Returns that are the primary responsibility of the Acquiror under applicable
Law.

6.7 Transition of Acquired Stores. With respect to the Acquired Stores, during
the Transition Period the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries shall make
available to the Acquiror and the Acquiror's employees Company personnel and, if
necessary, any software not included in the Assets transferred hereunder
necessary to effect an orderly transition from the Company's and the Operating
Subsidiaries' management information systems to the Acquiror's systems.

           any  investigation by any Governmental  Authority has been commenced,
           against  the   Acquiror,   the  Company  or  any  of  the   Company's
           Subsidiaries, or any of the principals,  officers or directors of any
           of them,  seeking to  restrain,  prevent  or change the  transactions
           contemplated  hereby or  questioning  the legality or validity of any
           such  transactions  or seeking  damages in  connection  with any such
           transactions;

     (c)   by  Acquiror,  if the  Company  or the  Operating  Subsidiaries  have
           breached any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, or if
           any  representation  or  warranty  of the  Company  or the  Operating
           Subsidiaries  shall have become untrue,  in either case such that the
           conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) would not be
           satisfied  (a  "Terminating  Company  Breach")  and such  Terminating
           Company  Breach is either  not  capable of being  cured  prior to the
           Closing or, if such breach is capable of being cured, is not so cured
           by the  Company or the  Operating  Subsidiaries  within a  reasonable
           amount of time (but in any event prior to the Closing);

           untrue,  in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
           5.3(a) or  Section  5.3(b)  would not be  satisfied  (a  "Terminating
           Acquiror Breach") and such Terminating  Acquiror Breach is either not
           capable of being  cured  prior to the  Closing  or, if such breach is
           capable  of being  cured,  is not so cured by the  Acquiror  within a
           reasonable amount of time (but in any event prior to the Closing);

     (e)   by Acquiror,  if the condition set forth in Section  5.2(d) shall not
           have been satisfied;

     (f)   by either Acquiror or the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries,  if
           there shall be an Order which is final and  nonappealable  preventing
           the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, unless the
           party  relying on such Order has not  complied  with its  obligations
           under Section 4.2 hereof;

     (g)   by either Acquiror or the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries,  if

           available  to  any  party  whose   failure  to  fulfill  any  of  the
           obligations  contained in this  Agreement  have been the cause of, or
           resulted in, the failure of the transactions  contemplated  hereby to
           have occurred on or prior to the  aforementioned  date; and provided,
           further,  that this  Agreement  may be extended by written  notice of
           either the Acquiror, the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries for up
           to  sixty  (60)  days  from  February  28,  2003 if the  transactions
           contemplated  hereby  have not been  consummated  as a result  of the
           conditions  set forth in Section  5.1(a),  Section  5.1(c) or Section
           5.2(n) not being satisfied;  provided,  further,  that this Agreement
           may be extended by Acquiror by written  notice for up to a period not
           to exceed sixty (60) days from  February  28, 2003 if  Acquiror,  the
           Company,  the Operating  Subsidiaries  or any of the firms engaged to
           provide the opinions referenced in Section 4.7 and Section 4.8 hereof

           the  terminating  party's  obligations  under this  Agreement  is not
           satisfied as a result of the other party's failure to comply with its
           obligations  under this Agreement,  the terminating  party's right to

     (f)   any Tax Claim  asserted  against  Acquiror  with respect to any Taxes
           relating  to the  Assets  or the  operations  of the  Company  or the

           decision  not  to  hire  previous  employees  of the  Company  or the
           Operating Subsidiaries related to the Stores;

     (k)   payments  made under Rental  Purchase  Agreements by customers of the
           Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date;

     (l)   any costs,  expenses or amounts (other than the payment of fees which

8.3 Indemnification by the Acquiror. Subject to the other provisions of this
Article VIII, from and after the Closing the Acquiror shall indemnify and hold
the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees, attorneys and agents harmless from, against and in respect
of any and all Indemnity Claims which arise or result from and to the extent
they are attributable to:

     (a)   the untruth, breach or failure of any representation or warranty made
           by the Acquiror  pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement or
           document  executed and delivered by the Acquiror in  connection  with
           the transactions contemplated hereby;

     (b)   the  breach  of,  or  failure  to  perform,  any  of  the  covenants,
           commitments,  agreements  or  obligations  of the  Acquiror  under or
           contained  in this  Agreement  or any  other  agreement  or  document
           executed  and  delivered  by the  Acquiror  in  connection  with  the
           transactions contemplated hereby; or

     (c)   the Assumed Liabilities.

8.4 Holdback Amount; Right of Set Off.

     (a)   On the Closing Date,  Acquiror shall withhold the Holdback Amount for
           the  payment of claims  asserted  against  the  Company or any of the
           Operating  Subsidiaries  and to provide  for the  payment in part the
           indemnification  rights of the Acquiror for a period of eighteen (18)
           months following the Closing Date. Upon notice to the Company and the
           Operating Subsidiaries, the Acquiror may set-off against the Holdback
           Amount any  amount to which it may be  entitled  under  this  Article
           VIII.  The  exercise  of  Acquiror's  right  ------------  to make an
           Indemnity  Claim for  set-off  against  the  Holdback  Amount in good
           faith,  whether or not ultimately  determined to be justified,  shall
           not be  deemed a breach  of  Acquiror's  obligation  to  deliver  the
           Purchaser  Price under this  Agreement.  Neither the exercise nor the
           failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election
           of  remedies  or  otherwise  limit  Acquiror  in  any  manner  in the
           enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

     (b)   On the 90th day following the Closing Date (the "Initial Distribution
           Date"), the Acquiror shall disburse to the Company,  on behalf of the
           Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, the total of $5,000,000, less
           the sum of (i) any  amounts  for  Claims  to which the  Acquiror  has
           exercised  its right of set-off  pursuant to Section  8.4(a) and (ii)
           any amounts representing unsatisfied Indemnity Claims ---------------
           asserted by Acquiror under Section 8.4(a) which are unresolved on the
           Initial  Distribution  Date.  On  the  --------------  date  that  is
           eighteen   (18)  months   following  the  Closing  Date  (the  "Final
           Distribution   Date"),   upon   the   execution   of  all   necessary
           documentation  reasonably  required by Acquiror,  the Acquiror  shall
           disburse to the Company,  on behalf of the Company and the  Operating
           Subsidiaries,  the amount of the Holdback Amount, less the sum of (i)
           all amounts for Indemnity  Claims to which the Acquiror has exercised
           its right of set-off  pursuant  to Section  8.4(a),  (ii) any amounts
           representing  unsatisfied Indemnity Claims asserted -------------- by
           the Acquiror  pursuant to Section  8.4(a) which are unresolved on the
           Final Distribution Date, and --------------- (iii) the amount paid to
           the Company, on behalf of the Company and the Operating  Subsidiaries
           on the Initial  Distribution  Date.  At such time that any  Indemnity
           Claims  which  are  unresolved  on the  Final  Distribution  Date are
           subsequently  resolved  and  which  the  Company  and  the  Operating
           Subsidiaries  would have been entitled to additional amounts paid out
           from the Holdback Amount (the "Excess"),  then Acquiror shall deliver
           the Excess to the Company, on behalf of the Company and the Operating
           Subsidiaries,  within five (5) business days of the final  resolution
           of such Indemnity Claims.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no portion
           of the Holdback Amount shall be paid to the Company, on behalf of the
           Company and the Operating  Subsidiaries,  until all Liens against the
           Assets shall have been released of record.

8.5 Method of Asserting Indemnity Claims, Etc. All claims for indemnification by
any party under this Section 8.5 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

     (a)   In the event  that any claim or demand in  respect of which any party
           would be entitled to  indemnification  hereunder is asserted  against
           such party by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), said party shall
           within ninety (90) days thereof notify the indemnifying party of such
           claim or demand, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such
           claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
           extent then  feasible,  which estimate shall not be conclusive of the
           final amount of such claim or demand (the "Indemnity  Claim Notice");
           provided,  however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party
           of the  commencement  of such Indemnity Claim within such ninety (90)
           day period will not relieve the  indemnifying  party of any liability
           that it may have to any indemnified party,  except to the extent that
           the indemnifying party conclusively  demonstrates that the defense of
           such action was  prejudiced by the  indemnifying  party's  failure to
           give such Indemnity Claim Notice.  The indemnifying  party shall have
           thirty  (30)  days  from the  personal  delivery  or  mailing  of the
           Indemnity   Claim  Notice  (the   "Notice   Period")  to  notify  the
           indemnified  party (i) whether or not it disputes  entitlement of the
           indemnified party to  indemnification  hereunder with respect to such
           claim or  demand,  and (ii)  whether  or not it desires at no cost or
           expense to the indemnified  party,  to defend the  indemnified  party
           against such claim or demand; provided, however, that any indemnified
           party is hereby  authorized  prior to and during the Notice Period to
           file any  motion,  answer  or  other  pleading  which  it shall  deem
           necessary  or  appropriate  to protect its  interests or those of the
           indemnifying  party and that are not  materially  prejudicial  to the
           indemnifying party. In the event that the indemnifying party notifies
           the  indemnified  party  within the Notice  Period that it desires to
           defend the indemnified  party against such claim or demand and except
           as hereinafter provided,  the indemnifying party shall have the right
           to defend by all appropriate proceedings,  which proceedings shall be
           promptly  settled or prosecuted by it to a final  conclusion.  If the
           indemnified  party desires to  participate  in, but not control,  any
           such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and expense.
           If requested by the indemnifying  party, the indemnified party agrees
           to  cooperate  with  the  indemnifying   party  and  its  counsel  in
           contesting any claim or demand which the indemnifying party elects to
           contest, or, if appropriate and related to the claim in question,  in
           making any counterclaim  against the person asserting the third cross
           complaint  against  any person.  No claim may be settled  without the
           consent  of  the  indemnifying  party,  which  consent  shall  not be
           unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  in connection
           with a Third Party Claim asserted against both such indemnified party
           and indemnifying  party, if (i) such indemnified  party has available
           to it  defenses  which  are in  addition  to those  available  to the
           indemnifying  party,  (ii) such indemnified party has available to it
           defenses which are  inconsistent  with the defenses  available to the
           indemnifying  party,  or (iii) a conflict exists or may reasonably be
           expected to exist in connection with the  representation of both such
           indemnified party and indemnifying  party by the legal counsel chosen
           by the  indemnifying  party,  such  indemnified  party shall have the
           right to select its own legal counsel subject to the approval of such
           legal  counsel by the  indemnifying  party,  such  approval not to be
           unreasonably  withheld.  If such  indemnified  party  selects its own
           legal counsel pursuant to the immediately  preceding sentence and the
           underlying Third Party Claim is otherwise subject to the scope of the
           indemnification  obligations  of the  indemnifying  party pursuant to
           this Article  VIII,  the  reasonable  fees and expenses of such legal
           counsel will be included  within the  indemnification  obligations of
           the   indemnifying   party;   provided,   however,   that   under  no
           circumstances  will the indemnifying  party be obligated to indemnify
           such indemnified party against the fees and expenses of more than one
           legal counsel selected by such indemnified party in connection with a
           single claim  (notwithstanding the number of persons against whom the
           Third Party Claim may be asserted).  To the extent an Indemnity Claim
           with respect to indemnification of representations  and warranties is
           made  within  the  survival  period set forth in  Section  8.1,  such
           Indemnity  Claim shall survive until such Indemnity Claim is resolved
           pursuant  to the  provisions  of Section  8.4 and Section 8.5 hereof,
           notwithstanding  the expiration of the applicable survival period set
           forth in Section 8.1.

     (b)   In the event any  indemnified  party  should have an  indemnification
           claim  hereunder  which  does not  involve  a claim or  demand  being
           asserted  against or sought to be collected from it by a third party,
           the  indemnified  party  shall send an  Indemnity  Claim  Notice with
           respect to such claim to the  indemnifying  party and, if applicable,
           otherwise  comply  with  the  provisions  of this  Section  8.5.  Any
           Inventory  Condition  Indemnity  Claim  shall be made no  later  than
           ninety (90) days after closing.

8.6 Limitation on Amount - Company and Operating Subsidiaries.

           with respect to the matters  described under Section 8.2(a) until the

           be payable by them exceeds $100,000 (the "Company Basket"); provided,
           however,  that in the event  that the  Indemnity  Claims to which the
           Acquiror shall be entitled exceed the Company Basket, the Company and
           the Operating  Subsidiaries shall be responsible for the total amount
           of such Indemnity Claims without giving effect to the Company Basket,
           but in no case shall the  liability of the Company and the  Operating
           Subsidiaries  with  respect  to matters  set forth in Section  8.2(a)
           hereunder exceed the Purchase Price.  However,  this Section 8.6 will
           not apply  to,  and the  Company's  and the  Operating  Subsidiaries'
           obligations  hereunder  shall  be  unlimited  for any  breach  of the
           Company's  or  the  Operating   Subsidiaries'   representations   and
           warranties  of which the Company or the  Operating  Subsidiaries  had
           knowledge at any time prior to the date on which such  representation
           and warranty is made.

     (b)   In the event that (i) an  Indemnity  Claim is made by  Acquiror  with
           respect to the condition of the Store  inventory sold hereunder as of
           the Closing Date pursuant to a breach of Section 3.10, (an "Inventory
           Condition  Indemnity Claim"),  and (ii) the Closing Inventory (net of
           30-days past due) exceeds $54,500,000,  then such Inventory Condition
           Indemnity  Claim  shall be reduced by the amount in which the Closing
           Inventory (net of 30-days past due) exceeds $54,500,000.

8.7 Limitation on Amount - Acquiror. Acquiror shall have no liability with
respect to the matters described under Section 8.3(a) until the aggregate of all
Indemnity Claims for which indemnity would otherwise be payable by Acquiror
exceeds $100,000 (the "Acquiror Basket"); provided, however, that in the event
that the Indemnity Claims to which the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to exceed the Acquiror Basket, the Acquiror shall be
responsible for the total amount of such Indemnity Claims without giving effect
to the Acquiror Basket, but in no case shall the liability of the Acquiror with
respect to matters set forth in Section 8.3(a) hereunder exceed the Purchase
Price.

8.8 Insurance and Tax Benefit. In calculating any amount due under this Article
VIII with respect to Indemnity Claims, such Indemnity Claims shall be reduced by
(a) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or third party indemnification obligations or other rights of recovery
with respect to such Indemnity Claims, and (b) the amount of any Net Tax Benefit
realized by the indemnified party from the incurrence or payment of such
Indemnity Claims.

Assets by Acquiror, and to permit Acquiror to exercise any of the franchises,

assume or evidence the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Acquiror, and to
assure and confirm to any other person the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
by Acquiror.

         5. This Agreement is in accordance with and is subject to all of the
representations, warranties, covenants, exclusions and indemnities set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the provisions of the Asset Purchase
Agreement shall govern.

                                   Exhibit "B"

              Form of Non-Competition and Non-Solicition Agreement

                               NON-COMPETITION AND
                           NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

         THIS NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement")
is made and entered into as of ____________, 2003, by and between RENT-WAY,
INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), RENT-WAY OF MICHIGAN, INC., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Rent-Way
Michigan"), RENT-WAY OF TTIG, L.P., an Indiana limited partnership and indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("TTIG" and together with Rent-Way
Michigan, the "Operating Subsidiaries"), and RENT-A-CENTER, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Acquiror"). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used
and not defined herein are as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Acquiror, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries have
entered into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 17,
2002 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Acquiror will acquire
certain assets of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries as more fully set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Assets"); and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Acquiror will acquire the Assets from certain stores operated by the
Company and the Operating Subsidiaries (each of which is herein referred to as a
"Store" and all of which are listed by location on Schedule 1.1 to the Asset
Purchase Agreement), which are engaged in the rent-to-own business (the
"Business"); and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.2(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
Acquiror's purchase of the Assets is conditioned upon the Company's and the
Operating Subsidiaries' execution and delivery of a non-competition and
non-solicitation agreement; and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
Acquiror has agreed to pay to the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries a
Non-Competition Payment of $500,000 in addition to other good and valuable
consideration in connection with the execution and delivery of such
non-competition and non-solicitation agreement; and

         WHEREAS, the Acquiror, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries
acknowledge that the value of the Assets includes, without limitation, goodwill
associated with such Assets at the Stores where such Assets are located, which
is of limited or no value without the non-competition and non-solicitation
promises contained herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other
consideration as herein recited, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. Covenant Not to Compete. For a period of four (4) years after the
Closing Date, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries each covenant and agree
that they shall not (i) directly or indirectly, including without limitation in
the capacity of owner, partner, shareholder, investor, franchisor, franchisee,
consultant, lender, or advisor, alone or with others, engage in the business of
rent-to-own, rental, lease-purchase, or retail transactions within a seven (7)
mile radius around each Store; (ii) solicit for the purpose of the activities
described in (i) above, any customer of the Stores reflected on the customer
lists set forth in Section 1.1(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement or those
customers of the Stores who are parties to Rental Purchase Agreements as of the
Closing Date; and (iii) operate any business within any of the above radiuses
that competes with any of Acquiror's rent-to-own stores or the rent-to-own
stores of any affiliate of Acquiror in any way; provided, however, that clauses
(i) and (iii) above shall not apply to those stores (excluding the Stores) owned
and operated by the Company, the Operating Subsidiaries or any of their
affiliates as of the Closing Date. This Section 1 shall not be deemed to
prohibit the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries from complying with their
respective duties and obligations as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement
with respect to (y) the Account Stores during the Transition Period; or (z) the
Leased Employees or any other of their respective duties or obligations related
to the Acquired Stores during the Transition Period.

         2. Agreement Concerning Employees. For a period of two years following
the Closing Date, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries each covenant and
agree that they will not, and will not permit any subsidiary or other affiliate
of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly
(including without limitation as an owner, partner, shareholder, investor,
franchisor, franchisee, lender, consultant or advisor), alone or with others,
solicit for employment, hire, employ or otherwise provide compensation for or to
any Person who was an employee of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries at
any Store on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Company and the
Operating Subsidiaries may, upon the expiration of the Transition Period,
solicit any Person who was an employee of the Company or any Operating
Subsidiary on the Closing Date, so long as such Person was not offered
employment by the Acquiror on or promptly after the end of the Transition
Period. This Section 2 shall not be deemed to prohibit the Company's or the
Operating Subsidiaries' (y) employment of or otherwise providing compensation
for any employee at any Account Store as the same shall be necessary for the
Company or the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to comply with their
respective duties and obligations related to the Account Stores during the
Transition Period as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement; or (z) from
complying with their respective duties and obligations with respect to the
Leased Employees or complying with any other of their respective duties and
obligations related to the Acquired Stores during the Transition Period as set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

         3. Payment. As contemplated by Section 1.3(a) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Acquiror shall pay the Non-Competition Payment to the Company at
Closing.

         4. Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that the covenants of each of
the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement are
special and unique, that a breach of any term or provision in this Agreement may
cause irreparable injury to Acquiror and that remedies at law for the breach of
any provision of this Agreement will be inadequate and that, in addition to any
other remedies it may have in the event of breach, Acquiror shall be entitled to
enforce specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to
obtain temporary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the continued breach
of such provisions without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual
damage. The covenants in this Agreement are independent, and the existence of
any claim or cause of action of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries or any
other affiliate of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries against Acquiror,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement of this Agreement by Acquiror.

         5. Separate Covenants. The parties hereto intend that the covenants
contained in Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement be construed as a series of
separate covenants, one for each defined region in each geographic area in which
any Store is located. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate
covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenants contained in
Sections 1 and 2 hereof. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce any of such separate covenants, then the unenforceable covenant(s) shall
be deemed eliminated from these provisions for the purpose of those proceedings
to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be
enforced; provided, however, in the event any such unenforceability is caused by
such separate covenant(s) being held to be excessively broad as to duration,
geographical scope, activity or subject, such separate covenant(s), at the
option of Acquiror, shall remain a part of this Agreement and shall be construed
by limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible
with the then applicable law.

         6. Tolling of Term. If, during any calendar month within the term of
this Agreement, any of the Company or the Operating Subsidiaries is not in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Acquiror shall be entitled to,
among other remedies, compliance by the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries
with the terms of this Agreement for an additional number of calendar months
that equals the number of calendar months during which such noncompliance
occurred.

         7. Reasonableness of Restrictions. The Company and the Operating
Subsidiaries each acknowledge that the geographic boundaries, scope of
prohibited activities, and time duration of the provisions of Sections 1 and 2
are reasonable and are no broader than are necessary to maintain and protect the
legitimate business interests of Acquiror.

         8. Integration. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and all other written or oral agreements relating to the subject matter hereof
are hereby superseded.

         9. Amendment; Waiver. No modification or amendment hereof shall be
valid and binding unless it be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. The
waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the particular purpose for which it was given. No failure to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof.

         10. Benefit; Assignment. No party may assign, by operation of law or
otherwise, any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Acquiror may
assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations hereunder to any
entity controlled by the Acquiror and may collaterally assign its rights
hereunder to any financial institution providing financing to Acquiror. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors.

         11. Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to
be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws effective
during the term of this Agreement, such provision shall be fully severable and
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement; and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by
its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of each such illegal,
invalid, or unenforceable provision, at the option of Acquiror, there shall be
added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal,
valid, and enforceable.

         12. Governing Law. This Agreement is to be interpreted and enforced
according to the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to the
principles of conflict of laws thereof.

         13. Costs. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce or
interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and necessary disbursements in addition to
any other relief to which it may be entitled.

         14. Remedies Cumulative. No remedy conferred by any of the specific
provisions of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy,
and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
by statute or otherwise. The election of any one or more remedies by any party
hereto shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available
remedies.

         15. Affiliates. As used herein, the term "affiliate" means any firm,
person, partnership, joint venture, corporation, unincorporated association, or
other entity (collectively, a "Person") controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with, the subject Person.

         16. Multiple Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in a number
of identical counterparts, each of which for all purposes is to be deemed an
original, and all of which constitute collectively, one Agreement; but in making
proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for
more than one such counterpart.

         17. Cumulative Rights. The rights of the parties under this Agreement
are cumulative and in addition to all similar and other rights of the parties
under other agreements between them, or among them and others.

                                   Exhibit "C"

                    Form of Opinion of Counsel to the Company

                                 [Closing Date]

Rent-A-Center, Inc.
5700 Tennyson Parkway
Third Floor
Plano, Texas  75024

     Re:   Acquisition  of  Certain  Assets  of  Rent-Way,   Inc.,  Rent-Way  of
           Michigan, Inc. and Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P. by Rent-A-Center, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to Rent-Way, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company"), and certain of its subsidiaries in connection with that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by
and among the Company, Rent-A-Center, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Rent-A-Center"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RentWay
Michigan"), Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P., an Indiana limited partnership ("TTIG") (the
Company, RentWay Michigan and TTIG shall hereinafter be referred to collectively
as the "Sellers"). This Opinion Letter is provided to you pursuant to Section
5.2(m) of the Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated herein, capitalized terms
used in this Opinion Letter are defined as set forth in the Agreement or the
Accord (see below).

         This Opinion Letter is governed by, and shall be interpreted in
accordance with, the Legal Opinion Accord (the "Accord") of the ABA Section of
Business Law (1991). As a consequence, it is subject to a number of
qualifications, exceptions, definitions, limitations on coverage and other
limitations, all as more particularly described in the Accord, and this Opinion
Letter should be read in conjunction therewith.

         The law covered by the opinions expressed herein is limited to the
Federal Law of the United States and the Law of the State of New York. To the
extent that matters covered by this Opinion Letter are governed by the laws of
any other jurisdiction, we have assumed, with your permission, for purposes of
this Opinion Letter that such laws are identical to the laws of the State of New
York. Accordingly, the opinions expressed herein concerning the Transaction
Documents governed by laws other than the State of New York, including, without
limitation, the opinion expressed in paragraph 3 below, are given as if the laws
of the State of New York governs without regard to the fact that such
Transaction Documents provide that the laws of such jurisdiction shall govern
the Transaction Documents.

         As to questions of fact material to such Opinions, we have, where
relevant facts were not independently verified or established, relied upon
certifications by officers of each of the Sellers, a copy of each of which is
attached as Exhibit "A" to this Opinion Letter (the "Officer's Certificate").

         Other Agreements and Court Orders shall be deemed to refer only to
those Other Agreements that are described on Exhibits "_" and "_" respectively,
to the Officer's Certificate and purporting to identify Material Contracts and
Court Orders.

         The provisions of Sections 1 through 9 and 18 through 21, inclusive, of
the Accord shall be applicable to those opinions expressed below that are not
specifically addressed by the Accord. In addition, the General Qualifications
shall apply to the No Violation of Law Opinion expressed in Paragraph 5 below.

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other qualifications
and limitations stated in this Opinion Letter, we are of the opinion that:

         (1)      The Company is a corporation, validly existing and in good
                  standing under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. RentWay
                  Michigan is a corporation, validly existing and in good
                  standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. TTIG is a
                  limited partnership, validly existing and in good standing
                  under the laws of the State of Indiana.

                     Form of Opinion of Counsel to Acquiror



                                 [Closing Date]

Rent-Way, Inc.
One RentWay Place
Erie, Pennsylvania  16505


     Re:   Acquisition of Certain Assets of each of Rent-Way,  Inc., Rent-Way of
           Michigan, Inc. and Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P. by Rent-A-Center, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We are counsel to Rent-A-Center, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Acquiror"), in connection with that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as
of December 17, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by and among the Acquiror, Rent-Way,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Rent-Way"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("RentWay Michigan"), and Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P., an
Indiana limited partnership ("TTIG") (Rent-Way, RentWay Michigan and TTIG shall
hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "Sellers"). This Opinion Letter
is provided to you pursuant to Section 5.3(f) of the Agreement. Except as
otherwise indicated herein, capitalized terms used in this Opinion Letter are
defined as set forth in the Agreement or the Accord (see below).

         Except as modified in this paragraph, this Opinion Letter is governed
by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the Legal Opinion Accord (the
"Accord") of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). As a consequence, it is
subject to a number of qualifications, exceptions, definitions, limitations on
coverage and other limitations, all as more particularly described in the
Accord, and this Opinion Letter should be read in conjunction therewith. The law
covered by the opinions expressed herein is limited to the Federal Law of the
United States, the Law of the State of Texas and the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

         As to questions of fact material to such Opinions, we have, where
relevant facts were not independently verified or established, relied upon
inquiry of officers of the Acquiror.

         The provisions of Sections 1 through 9 and 18 through 21, inclusive, of
the Accord shall be applicable to those opinions expressed below that are not
specifically addressed by the Accord.

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other qualifications
and limitations stated in this Opinion Letter, we are of the opinion that:

         [1] The Acquiror is a corporation, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

         [2] The Acquiror has the corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver, and perform its obligations under the Agreement. The Agreement has been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Acquiror
and has been duly executed and delivered by the Acquiror.

         [3] The Agreement is enforceable against the Acquiror.

         [4] The execution and delivery by the Acquiror of, and performance of
its agreements in, the Agreement do not violate the Constituent Documents of
Acquiror.

         [5] No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other
action by or filing with any governmental authority is required under Texas or
federal statutes or regulations in connection with the execution and delivery by
the Acquiror of the Agreement, except for those already obtained or completed.

         We hereby confirm to you that there are no actions or proceedings
against the Acquiror pending before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator
which seek to affect the enforceability of the Agreement.

         This Opinion Letter may be relied upon by you only in connection with
the Transaction and may not be used or relied upon by you or any other person
for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent authorized in the Accord,
without in each instance our prior written consent.

                                       Very truly yours,



                                       WINSTEAD SECHREST & MINICK P.C.
