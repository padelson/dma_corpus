2.2  Purchase Price Adjustments.
     --------------------------

     (a) Post-Closing Adjustment for Net Tangible Assets.
         -----------------------------------------------

     (i) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchasers and their
auditors will conduct an audit (the "Closing Audit") of the Companies as of the
                                     -------------
Closing Date in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
consistently applied, as modified by the Accounting Conventions, and will
prepare and deliver to the Sellers a computation (the "Draft Balance Sheet") of
                                                       -------------------
the Net Tangible Assets Amount as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Tangible
                                                            --------------------
Assets Amount") and the Accounts Receivable Amount as of the Closing Date (the
-------------
"Closing Accounts Receivable Amount"). The Draft Balance Sheet shall indicate
 ----------------------------------
the portion of the Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount attributable to the
Companies (and take into account (without duplication) the Acquired Louisiana
Assets of BESI and the Acquired Other Assets of BESI) and shall indicate the
Closing Accounts Receivable Amount. The Purchasers and their auditors will make
available to the Sellers and their auditors all records and work papers used in
preparing the Draft Balance Sheet. If the Sellers disagree with the computation
of the Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount or the Closing Accounts Receivable
Amount, the Sellers may, within 30 days after receipt of the Draft Balance
Sheet, deliver a notice (an "Objection Notice") to the Purchasers setting forth
                             ----------------
the Sellers' calculation of the Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount and the
Closing Accounts Receivable Amount, as the case may be. The Purchasers and the
Sellers will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the
computation of the disputed Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount (or if
applicable, the Closing Accounts Receivable Amount), but if they do not obtain a
final resolution within 30 days after the Purchasers have received the Objection
Notice, the Purchasers and the Sellers will, within 20 days of the termination
of said 30 day period, jointly retain an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing (the "Firm") to resolve any remaining
                                   ----
disagreements. If the Purchasers and the Sellers are unable to agree on the
choice of the Firm, then the Firm will be a "big-five" accounting firm (or a
successor) selected by random drawing (after excluding one firm designated by
the Purchasers and one firm designated by the Sellers). The Purchasers and the
Sellers will direct the Firm to render a determination within 60 days of its
retention and the Purchasers, the Sellers and their respective agents will
cooperate with the Firm during its engagement. The Firm will consider only those
items and amounts in the Draft Balance Sheet set forth in the Objection Notice
which the Purchasers and the Sellers are unable to resolve. The Purchasers and
the Sellers shall each submit a written statement to the Firm within 30 days
after the Firm's engagement, which written statement shall contain such Party's
computation of the applicable Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount (or if
applicable, the Closing Accounts Receivable Amount) and information, arguments,
and support for such Party's position. The Firm shall review such written
statements and base its determination solely on them. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by either Party. The Firm's determination will be based on the
definitions of the Net Tangible Assets Amount and Accounts Receivable Amount
included herein. The determination of the Firm will be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall equally bear the costs
and expenses of the Firm. The Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount as

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is referred to herein as the
                                    --------------
"Actual Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount," and the Closing Accounts Receivable
 -----------------------------------------
Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is referred to
                                              --------------
herein as the "Actual Accounts Receivable Amount."
               ---------------------------------

     (ii)    If the Actual Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount is less than
$189,555,220, (which such amount has been determined based on the calculation
set forth in the Financial Statements Schedule under the heading "Calculation of
Net Tangible Assets Amount") the Purchasers shall be entitled to receive from
the Holdback the amount of such shortfall (the "Net Tangible Assets Amount
                                                --------------------------
Shortfall"); provided, however, that if the amount then left in the Holdback is
---------    --------  -------
less than the amount of the Net Tangible Assets Amount Shortfall, the Sellers
shall pay to the Purchasers, within two (2) business days after the
determination of the Actual Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount, the amount by
which the Holdback is less than the Net Tangible Assets Amount Shortfall by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds. If the Actual Closing
Net Tangible Assets Amount is greater than $189,555,220 (which such amount has
been determined based on the calculation set forth in the Financial Statements
Schedule under the heading "Calculation of Net Tangible Assets Amount"), the
Sellers shall be entitled to receive the amount of such excess (the "Net
                                                                     ---
Tangible Assets Amount Overage"). In such case, the Purchasers shall pay to the
------------------------------
Sellers, within two (2) business days after the determination of the Actual
Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount, the Net Tangible Assets Amount Overage by
wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds. All payments
made pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)(ii) shall be an adjustment to the portion
                      ------------------
of the Purchase Price attributed to the Acquired Other Assets of BESI set forth
on the Schedule of Sellers.
       -------------------

     (iii)   If the Actual Accounts Receivable Amount is less than the Estimated
Accounts Receivable Amount, the Purchasers shall be entitled to receive from the
Holdback the amount of such shortfall (the "Accounts Receivable Amount
                                            --------------------------
Shortfall"); provided however, that if the amount then left in the Holdback is
---------    -------- -------
less than the amount of the Accounts Receivable Amount Shortfall, the Sellers
shall pay to the Purchasers, within two (2) business days after the
determination of the Actual Accounts Receivable Amount, the amount by which the
Holdback is less than the Accounts Receivable Amount Shortfall by wire transfer
or delivery of other immediately available funds. If the Actual Accounts
Receivable Amount is greater than the Estimated Accounts Receivable Amount, the
Sellers shall be entitled to receive the amount of such excess (the "Accounts
                                                                     --------
Receivable Amount Overage"). In such case, the Purchasers shall pay to the
-------------------------
Sellers, within two (2) business days after the determination of the Actual
Accounts Receivable Amount, the Accounts Receivable Amount Overage by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds. All payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)(iii) shall be an adjustment to the portion of
                 -------------------
the Purchase Price attributed to the Acquired Other Assets of BESI set forth on
the Schedule of Sellers.
    -------------------

     (b)     Accounts Receivable.
             -------------------

     (i)     Subsequent to the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause the
Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts (applying substantially similar
standards as those

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

employed by the Companies prior to the Closing) to collect all of the accounts
and notes receivable comprising the Actual Accounts Receivable Amount (the
"Retained Receivables"). Such efforts may include retaining a collection agency,
 --------------------
bringing an action or suit for recovery of outstanding amounts and taking
similar actions (collectively, the "Collection Actions") as may be reasonably
                                    ------------------
required to collect such Retained Receivables. The Purchasers shall cause the
Companies to take such Collection Actions to the extent that such Collection
Actions would have been customarily employed by the Companies in the conduct of
their business under similar circumstances prior to the Closing. Sellers shall
reimburse the Purchasers for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Companies (or the Purchasers) in connection with any Collection Actions with
respect to the Retained Receivables.

     (ii)    Purchasers shall, and shall cause the Companies to, reasonably
cooperate with the Seller in connection with the collection of the Retained
Receivables. Purchasers shall designate one of their collection staff
representatives (the "Accounts Receivable Coordinator") to assume responsibility
                      -------------------------------
for collecting the Retained Receivables, communicating with the Sellers with
respect to the status of such collection efforts and providing the Sellers or
their representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to
reports, records and work papers relating to such collection efforts. On a
monthly basis, Sellers shall reimburse the Purchasers for half of the base
salary of such Accounts Receivable Coordinator. The Parties agree that the
Accounts Receivable Coordinator shall be employed by the Purchasers or their
Affiliates and shall have accounts receivable collection responsibilities for
both Parties. As may be reasonably requested, the Accounts Receivable
Coordinator shall arrange for Sellers' reasonable access to all information
(e.g., records or work papers) related to the Retained Receivables and all
personnel of the Companies, Purchasers and their respective Affiliates
knowledgeable about such Retained Receivables and any related collection
efforts. Unless otherwise previously agreed to in writing by the Purchasers, the
Sellers shall not contact or communicate, directly or indirectly, with the
customers of the Companies with respect to the collection of Retained
Receivables.

     (iii)   For purposes of determining amounts collected by the Companies (or
the Purchasers) with respect to the Retained Receivables, (a) if an account
debtor specifies that a payment should be applied to a particular invoice, such
payment shall be applied to such invoice, and (b) if an account debtor does not
specify to which invoice payment should be applied, such payment shall be
applied to the oldest outstanding invoice due from such account debtor.

     (iv)    The Retained Receivables shall be paid out in accordance with the
following timetable. No Retained Receivables shall be remitted to the Sellers
during the 15 day period following the Closing Date. On the first Friday
thereafter, the Purchasers shall remit to Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all
Retained Receivables collected following the Closing through the Tuesday
immediately preceding such Friday. On each Friday during the subsequent ten week
period, the Purchasers shall remit to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all Retained
Receivables collected through the Tuesday immediately preceding such Friday
(without

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

     duplication to amounts previously paid by Purchasers to Sellers pursuant
     this paragraph). Following the three month anniversary of the Closing Date,
     the Purchasers shall remit to the Sellers on the first Friday of each such
     month, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
     the aggregate amount of all Retained Receivables collected through the
     Tuesday immediately preceding such Friday (without duplication to amounts
     previously paid by Purchasers to Sellers pursuant this paragraph).

          (v) Sellers shall promptly remit to the Purchasers any accounts
     receivables of the Companies received in error by them following the
     Closing to the extent such amounts are not part of the Retained Receivables
     (and to the extent such amounts are part of the Retained Receivables,
     Sellers shall promptly notify the Accounts Receivable Coordinator of such
     receipt). The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with one another to ensure
     customer invoices are directed to the appropriate Party.

          (vi) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchasers shall have
     no right to set off against the Accounts Receivable Amount any amount owed
     by the Sellers or their Affiliates to the Purchasers pursuant to this
     Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or otherwise.

     2.3  Distribution of Holdback. On the 150th day after the Closing Date (or
          ------------------------
if later, the second business day after the Actual Closing Net Tangible Assets
Amount is finally determined), the Purchasers (or, if applicable, the escrow
agent) shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the amount of the Holdback
(plus interest earned thereon), if any, remaining after (i) all amounts owing to
the Purchasers pursuant to Section 2.2 have been satisfied and (ii) all claims
                           -----------
of the Purchasers under Section 9.2 which have theretofore been finally resolved
                        -----------
have been satisfied (the "Remaining Holdback") less any amount for which the
                          ------------------
Purchasers assert any good faith claim (reasonably ascertainable as to the
amount thereof), prior to such day, that it is entitled to receive
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 (each, a "Pending Claim"). As soon as
                            -----------           -------------
practicable following final resolution of all Pending Claims, the Purchasers
shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate amount equal to the portion, if any, of
the Holdback which remains after payment of the Remaining Holdback and final
resolution of all Pending Claims.

          (iii) any Retained Liabilities;

          (iv)  Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities; and

                              -----------------    ------------------
     the Purchaser Parties give the Sellers written notice thereof within the
     Applicable Limitation Date;

          (ii)  the aggregate amount of all payments made by the Sellers in

          (iii) the Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify any Purchaser
     Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the Purchaser

     Parties have collectively suffered Losses in excess of a $1,250,000
     aggregate basket (the "Basket") (at which point, subject to other
                            ------
     limitations herein, the Sellers will be liable to the Purchaser Parties
     only for all Losses in excess of such Basket); provided that no claim shall
                                                    -------- ----
     count for purposes of determining the Basket (whether under Section
                                                                 -------
     9.2(b)(iii) or Section 9.2(d)(iii)) unless such claim, or series of

     otherwise taken into account in the determination of the Closing Net
     Tangible Assets Amount or the Closing Accounts Receivable Amount.

          (c)   Each of the Purchasers and the Purchaser Guarantor shall jointly
and severally indemnify the Sellers, the Seller Guarantor and each of their
respective agents, representatives, affiliates, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Parties") and hold each of them harmless from and
                    --------------
against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Seller Parties in respect of any
Loss which any such Seller Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a
result of or relating to:

          (i)   the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
     Purchasers or the Purchaser Guarantor contained in this Agreement or any
     certificate delivered by the Purchasers or the Purchaser Guarantor to the
     Sellers or the Seller Guarantor with respect thereto in connection with the
     Closing;

                                       -36-

<PAGE>

          (ii)  the breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Purchasers
     or the Purchaser Guarantor contained in this Agreement, the other
     Transaction Documents, any Exhibit or Schedule hereto or any certificate
     delivered by the Purchasers or the Purchaser Guarantor to the Sellers or
     the Seller Guarantor with respect thereto in connection with the Closing;

          (iii) the Assumed Liabilities; and

          (iv)  the BESI Guarantees (as hereinafter defined).

          (d)   The Seller Parties' remedy for any indemnification of Losses

limitations:

          (i)   the Purchasers will be liable to the Seller Parties with respect
     to claims referred to in Section 9.2(c)(i) only if the Seller Parties give

     the Purchasers written notice thereof within the Applicable Limitation
     Date;

          (ii)  the aggregate amount of all payments made by the Purchasers in
     satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i)
                                                            -----------------
     shall not exceed the Cap; and


          (iii) the Purchasers shall not be liable to indemnify any Seller
     Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i) unless and until the Seller Parties
                         -----------------
     have collectively suffered Losses in excess of the Basket (at which point,
     subject to other limitations herein, the Purchasers will be liable to the
     Seller Parties for all Losses in excess of such Basket).

          (e)   If a party hereto seeks indemnification under this Article IX,
                                                                   ----------
such party (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice to the other
                 -----------------
party (the "Indemnifying Party") after receiving written notice of any action,
            ------------------
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third
party) or discovering the liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such
claim for indemnification, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known
and quantifiable), and the basis thereof; provided that the failure to so notify
                                          -------- ----
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have harmed the
Indemnifying Party. In that regard, if any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim shall be brought or asserted by any third party
which, if adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity
pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
                 ----------
Indemnifying Party of the same in writing, specifying in detail the basis of
such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to the Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnification at its expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations
set forth below) shall be entitled to appoint lead counsel of such defense with
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that,
                                                                  -------- ----
if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense, the Indemnifying
Party will be fully responsible for all Losses relating to such claims and that
it will provide full indemnification to the Indemnified Party for all Losses
relating to such claim, and,

                                       -37-

<PAGE>

provided further that, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained
by the Indemnified Party, if the claim over which the Indemnifying Party seeks
to assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) involves a claim to which the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes an adverse determination would be detrimental to or
injure the Indemnified Party's reputation or future business prospects, or (iv)
involves a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate
court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend.

          If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the
defense and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any
such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party
has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.

          If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim, if pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, injunction or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if such settlement does not
expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice.

          (f) Amounts paid to or on behalf of Sellers or Purchasers as
indemnification under this Article IX shall be treated as adjustments to the
                           ----------
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, and shall be calculated after giving effect to
(i) any proceeds received from insurance policies covering the Loss that is the
subject of the claim for indemnity, and (ii) the actual realized Tax benefit to
the Indemnified Party resulting from the Loss that is the subject of the
indemnity and of the indemnity payment itself; provided that to the extent that
                                               -------- ----
any Tax benefit is realized in a Tax year other than the year in which the
indemnity is paid, the Indemnified Party shall make a payment to the
Indemnifying Party in the amount of such realized Tax benefit in the year in
which it is realized. For purposes of this Article IX, an actual realized Tax
                                           ----------
benefit is an actual reduction in the amount of Taxes payable or a refund of
Taxes previously paid.

          (g) Indemnification Procedures for Environmental Cleanup. Any claim
              ----------------------------------------------------
for indemnification arising out of Environmental Cleanup Activities (as defined
below) relating to a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability (a "Cleanup Claim")
                                                             -------------
shall be subject to the following procedures in addition to those set forth
above in this Section 9.2 (or instead of such procedures, to the extent the such
              -----------
procedures are inconsistent with those set forth in this subsection (g)):

          (i) The party making a Cleanup Claim (the "Cleanup Indemnitee") shall
                                                     ------------------
     notify the indemnifying party (the "Cleanup Indemnitor") of the claim in
                                         ------------------
     writing promptly after learning of the existence of such claim, which
     notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature the claim, the amount
     of the claim (to the extent known and

                                       -38-

<PAGE>

     quantifiable), and a reasonably detailed description of the facts giving
     rise to such claim; provided, however, that the failure to so notify a
                         --------  -------
     Cleanup Indemnitor shall not relieve the Cleanup Indemnitor of its
     obligations hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent) such
     failure shall have prejudiced the Cleanup Indemnitor.

          (ii)  Upon receipt of a Cleanup Claim, the Cleanup Indemnitor shall
     have 60 days in which to acknowledge in writing or to deny that it will
     undertake responsibility for the principal management of the subject matter
     of the Cleanup Claim ("Principal Management"). The Cleanup Indemnitee shall
                            --------------------
     cooperate with the Cleanup Indemnitor reasonably to satisfy the Cleanup
     Indemnitor's reasonable information needs to evaluate the Cleanup Claim,
     including facilitating the Cleanup Indemnitor's access and ability to
     conduct such investigation and sampling activity as the Cleanup Indemnitor
     deems reasonably appropriate. The Cleanup Indemnitor may decline to
     undertake Principal Management under either of only two conditions: (i)
     upon notice to the Cleanup Indemnitee of its good faith belief that it does
     not bear responsibility for the subject matter of the Cleanup Claim; or
     (ii) upon its election not to assume Principal Management despite an
     admission of responsibility for such Cleanup Claim. The party receiving
     such a notice of denial shall be entitled immediately to assume Principal
     Management of the matter. If the Cleanup Indemnitor fails to respond to a
     Cleanup Claim within the allowed time, it will be deemed to have admitted
     responsibility for the Cleanup Claim and to have elected not to assume
     Principal Management with respect to such matter. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, to the extent that the circumstances giving rise to the Cleanup
     Claim present an imminent danger to human health and/or to the environment,
     and the Cleanup Indemnitee has, if practicable, given written notice of
     such to the Cleanup Indemnitor and a reasonable opportunity for the Cleanup
     Indemnitor to respond, the Cleanup Indemnitee may, without prejudice to any
     rights it may have with respect to the Cleanup Claim, proceed to take
     appropriate, limited response measures even if the 60-day notice period has
     not expired, provided that such limited response measures are consistent
     with the principles set forth in subparts (iv) and (v) below.

          (iii) The party not exercising Principal Management shall be entitled,
     at its sole cost and expense, to participate reasonably in the management
     of such Cleanup Claim, including, without limitation (subject to all
     applicable privileges), receiving copies of all reports, workplans and
     analytical data prepared for or submitted to governmental agencies, all
     material notices, letters or documents received from governmental agencies
     and any other material documentation or correspondence bearing on the

                                                         -------------------

     which the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 is
                                                            -----------
     finally determined (the "Allocation"), which Allocation shall be binding
                              ----------
     upon the Sellers unless Sellers reasonably believe that such Allocation was
     not prepared in accordance with the Code and Treasury Regulations
     promulgated thereunder; provided that, if the Sellers do not object within
                             -------- ----
     20 days after their receipt of the Allocation from Purchasers, such
     Allocation shall be treated as the agreed upon final Allocation. If the
     Sellers do object to the Allocation by delivering written notice to the
     Purchasers within 20 days after Sellers' receipt thereof, the Purchasers
     and the Sellers shall work in good faith and shall use their best efforts
     to agree upon a mutually agreeable Allocation; provided that, if the
                                                    -------- ----
     Purchasers and Sellers cannot, within 10 days thereof, agree upon a
     mutually agreeable Allocation, all items of such Allocation on which the

     and Sellers (the "Third Party Accountant") for resolution within 10 days of
                       ----------------------
     submission thereto; provided that any such dispute shall be resolved in
                         -------- ----
     favor of the Purchasers unless the Third Party Accountant determines that
     the Allocation has not been prepared in accordance with the Code and
     regulations thereunder and that

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

     there is no reasonable basis for the Purchasers' position. The number of
     days included in this Section 10.2(a)(iv) for each of the respective
                           ------------------
     Parties to prepare, object to or agree on (as the case may be) the
     Allocation shall be reduced on an equitable basis, if necessary, so that
     the Allocation can be finalized and, if required, the Third Party
     Accountant can make its determination at least two business days prior to
     the date on which the Section 338(h)(10) Election is required to be filed.
     The Purchasers and the Sellers shall file any Tax Returns and any other
     governmental filings on a basis consistent with such allocation of fair
     market value.

reimburse the Purchasers for all Taxes of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
with respect to any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date within ten days of payment by the Purchasers or the Companies or their
Subsidiaries of such Taxes, except, in the case of non-income Taxes, to the
extent such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax) shown on the Actual Closing Net Tangible Assets Amount. The
Purchasers shall reimburse the Sellers for any payment made by Sellers for any
Taxes of the Companies and their Subsidiaries with respect to any period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date within 10 days of payment by
the Sellers of such Taxes. For purposes of this Section 10.2(b), in the case of
                                                --------------
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such
Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on (or beginning
after) the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes
based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on (or beginning after)
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Taxable period ended on (or beginning after) the Closing Date.

          (c) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
              ----------------------
agreements (other than this Agreement) with respect to or involving the
Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be terminated at the time of the Closing
and, after the Closing Date, neither the Purchasers (or any of their direct or
indirect Subsidiaries or Affiliates) nor the Companies and their Subsidiaries
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

          (d) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as
              --------------------------
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 10.2 and any audit,
                                           ------------
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Companies and the Sellers agree (A) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies and
their Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Purchasers or any of the Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record

                                       -42-

<PAGE>

retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the
other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the
Companies or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to
take possession of such books and records

     10.3 Press Releases and Announcements. Prior to the Closing Date, no press
          --------------------------------
releases related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, or
other announcements to the employees, customers or suppliers of the Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries shall be issued without the mutual approval of all
Parties, except for any public disclosure which any Party in good faith believes
is required by law, regulation or the rules of any applicable stock exchange;
provided that in the event the Purchasers file a registration statement with the
-------- ----
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Purchasers shall be entitled to
adequately disclose the transactions contemplated hereby in such registration
agreement. After the Closing Date, no press releases related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein, shall be issued without the prior
consent of the Purchaser Guarantor and the Seller Guarantor (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

     10.4 Further Transfers. Each Seller shall execute and deliver such further
          -----------------
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional action as the
Purchasers may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the
transfer to the Purchasers of the Acquired Stock, the Acquired Louisiana Assets
of BESI, the Acquired Other Assets of BESI and any other transactions
contemplated hereby.

     10.5 Specific Performance. Each Party recognizes and affirms that in the
          --------------------
event of a breach of this Agreement by either Party, money damages may be
inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that the non-breaching Party shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and the other Party's obligations hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief.

     10.6 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the Sellers and
          --------
the Purchasers shall pay all of their own fees, costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment
bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants and appraisal fees,
costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby, the performance of their
obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Upon the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchasers shall reimburse the Sellers for
their portion of the filing fee associated with making the filing required under
the HSR Act in connection with this transaction. If the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement are not consummated, each of the Parties shall
bear their own fees and expenses associated with making the filing required
under the HSR Act.

     10.7 Exclusivity. Until the first to occur of the Closing and the
          -----------
termination of this Agreement (the "Exclusivity Period"), no Seller shall, and
                                    ------------------
no Seller shall permit any of its employees, officers, directors, shareholders,
affiliates (except that negotiations by management of the Companies which have
not been authorized by the Sellers shall not, in and of themselves,

                                       -43-

<PAGE>

be deemed a breach of this Section 10.7), financial or legal advisors or any
                           ------------
other Person acting on its behalf to, negotiate with any other Person a possible
sale of all or part of the Companies' securities or assets (other than the sale
of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business), whether such transaction takes
the form of a sale of stock, merger, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization,
recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets, or otherwise (an "Acquisition
                                                                   -----------
Proposal"), or provide any information to any other Person concerning the
--------
Companies with a view toward negotiating an Acquisition Proposal. The Sellers
hereby represent that the Sellers do not have (and since October 25, 2001, they
have not had) any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (except for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and (b) shall as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any case,
within 24 hours) notify the Purchasers if any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or contact with any person or entity with respect thereto, is made. In
view of the difficulty of determining damages for a breach of this Section 10.7,
                                                                   ------------
the Parties have agreed that the Purchasers shall be entitled to receive
liquidated damages of $2.5 million plus all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
the event of a breach of this Section 10.7 by the Sellers; provided, however,
                              ------------                 --------  -------
the Purchasers shall provide the Sellers with prior written notice of its
payment of or contractual commitment to pay, any fees to their senior lenders in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

     10.8 Books and Records. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
          -----------------
Sellers and the Purchasers, the Purchasers and the Sellers will not, for a
period of seven years following the date hereof, destroy, alter or otherwise
dispose of any of the books and records of the Companies acquired by the
Purchasers hereunder or retained by any Sellers without first offering to
surrender to the other Party such books and records or any portion thereof of
which the Sellers or the Purchasers may intend to destroy, alter or dispose. The
Purchasers and the Sellers will allow the other Party's representatives,
attorneys and accountants access to such books and records, upon reasonable
request during such Party's normal business hours, for the purpose of examining
and copying the same in connection with any matter whether or not related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

     10.9 Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation and Confidentiality.
          ---------------------------------------------------

          (a) Noncompetition. In consideration of the mutual covenants provided
              --------------
for herein to the Sellers at the Closing, during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Noncompete Period"), the Sellers, the Seller Guarantor and their Affiliates
 -----------------
(collectively, the "Noncompeting Parties") shall not engage (whether as an
                    --------------------
owner, operator, manager, employee, officer, director, consultant, advisor,
representative or otherwise), directly or indirectly, in the following
activities: (i) equipment rental activities, including, without limitation, the
rental of construction and industrial equipment in markets currently serviced or
proposed to be serviced by the Companies, or (ii) any other business that the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries conduct as of the Closing Date in the
United States or Canada; provided that (i) ownership of less than 2% of the
                         -------------
outstanding stock of any publicly-traded corporation shall not be deemed to be
engaging solely by reason thereof in any of its businesses and (ii) this Section
                                                                         -------
10.9(a) shall not prohibit the Sellers or their Affiliates from continuing to
------
conduct their businesses as conducted as of the date hereof (other than the
business being sold hereunder). The parties hereto agree that the covenant set
forth in this Section 10.9 is reasonable with respect to its duration,
              ------------
geographical area and scope. If the final

                                       -44-

<PAGE>

judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Section 10.9(a) is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree
                  --------------
that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

          (b) Nonsolicitation. Each of the Sellers agrees that, during the
              ---------------
Noncompete Period, such Seller (i) shall not, and shall cause the other
Noncompeting Parties to not, directly or indirectly contact, approach or solicit
for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) or actually hire any
person employed by the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries at any time prior
to the Closing Date or during the Noncompete Period, without the prior written
consent of the Companies and (ii) shall not induce or attempt to induce, and
shall cause the other Noncompeting Parties to not induce or attempt to induce,
any customer or other business relation of the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries into any business relationship which might materially harm the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries. Unless it closes the transactions
contemplated hereunder, until October 25, 2002, each of the Purchasers and their
Affiliates shall not, and shall use their best efforts not to permit such
Purchasers' Affiliates to, directly or indirectly contact, approach or solicit
for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) or actually hire any
person employed by the Companies or their Subsidiaries with whom Purchasers or
their Affiliates contacted in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, without the prior written consent of the Sellers. The term "indirectly"
as used in this Section 10.9 is intended to mean any acts authorized or directed
                ------------
by or on behalf of any Seller or any person controlled by such Seller.

          (c) Confidentiality. Each of the Sellers shall, and shall cause the
              ---------------
other Noncompeting Parties to, treat and hold as confidential any information
concerning the business and affairs of the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries that is not already generally available to the public (the
"Confidential Information"), refrain from using any of the Confidential
 ------------------------
Information except in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to
the Purchasers or destroy, at the request and option of the Purchasers, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information which are
in his possession or under his control; provided that this Section 10.9(c) shall
                                        -------- ----      --------------
not prohibit the Sellers or their Affiliates from continuing to conduct their
businesses as conducted as of the date hereof (other than the business being
sold hereunder). In the event that any Noncompeting Party is requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Sellers shall cause such
Noncompeting Party to notify the Purchasers promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.9(c). If, in the absence
                                             --------------
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Noncompeting
Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Noncompeting
Party may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided that
                                                                 -------- ----
the Noncompeting Party shall

                                       -45-

<PAGE>

use his or its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Purchasers'
efforts to obtain an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall
be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed.

           (d) Remedy for Breach. Each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees
               -----------------
that in the event of a breach by any Seller of any of the provisions of this
Section 10.9, monetary damages may not constitute a sufficient remedy.
------------
Consequently, in the event of any such breach, the Companies, the Purchasers
and/or their respective Subsidiaries, successors or assigns may, in addition to
other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or
other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions
hereof, in each case without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual
damages. In addition, in the event of an alleged breach or violation by any
Seller of Section 10.9, the Noncompete Period set forth in such Section 10.9(a)
          ------------                                          ---------------
shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly cured.

     10.10 Use of Brambles Name. As promptly as reasonably practicable
           --------------------
subsequent to the Closing, the Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of the Companies to cease using the Brambles name or any
derivative thereof in any way. Without limiting the foregoing, as promptly as
reasonably practicable subsequent to the Closing, the Purchasers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companies to (a) change the name of
any Company and any Subsidiary of the Companies that includes "Brambles" and (b)
remove the Brambles name, any derivative thereof and any logo related thereto
from any equipment, vehicles, buildings or other objects on which such name
appears. Subject to the foregoing, for a period of six months beginning on the
Closing Date, the Sellers grant to the Companies and their Subsidiaries a
royalty-free license to use the Brambles and BESI trade names (or any other
variation thereof which is used in connection with the operation of the business
of the Companies) (collectively the "Marks"), in connection with the provision
                                     -----
of the services that the Companies or their Subsidiaries currently provide. All
use of the Marks by the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall inure to the
benefit of Sellers. Nothing in this Section 10.10 shall be construed to be a
                                    -------------
transfer or assignment of Sellers' rights in the Marks. The Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall maintain quality standards for all permitted uses of the
Marks that shall be substantially equivalent to those standards used by the
Companies in connection with the Services immediately prior to the Closing Date.
If Sellers reasonably find that any services offered or sold by the Companies in
connection with or bearing the Marks are not in accordance with such quality
standards and so notify the Companies in writing, the Sellers and the Companies
will negotiate in good faith and on reasonable terms concerning the corrections
to be made to the quality and/or methods of quality control of such services. In
the event that the Companies do not implement any agreed-upon corrections within
thirty (30) days from when both parties have agreed upon any corrections to be
made in order for the standard of quality to be met, the Sellers shall have the
right to terminate the license granted in this Section 10.10 and require the
                                               -------------
Companies to discontinue the use of the Marks.

     10.11 Employee Benefit Matters.
           ------------------------

           (a) Employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (and their
covered dependents) shall continue to participate in the Benefit Plans providing
health, dental, vision, life and disability benefits (other than any Benefit
Plan that is a cafeteria plan) through the later of


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

the Closing Date or January 31, 2002 (the "Coverage Date") and Sellers agree to
                                           -------------
use their reasonable best efforts to continue in effect the current stop loss
policy applicable to group medical coverage under the Benefit Plans through the
Coverage Date. Effective as of the day following the Coverage Date, the
Purchasers shall offer coverage under their benefits plans, programs, policies
and arrangements to nonunion employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries.
To the extent applicable with respect to the Purchasers' plans, employees of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) shall be given
credit for their service with the Sellers (i) for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual) to the extent such service
was taken into account under a corresponding Benefit Plan, and (ii) for purposes
of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations and shall be given credit
for amounts paid under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable Purchasers' plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this paragraph (a), service or other amounts shall not be credited to employees
of the Company and their Subsidiaries (or their eligible dependents) to the
extent such crediting would result in duplication of benefits. For periods after
the Coverage Date, union employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall
be provided with benefits as required by the terms of their respective
collective bargaining agreements and, to the extent applicable, shall continue
to participate under the multiemployer plans as required under their respective
collective bargaining agreements. The Sellers shall retain all liability and
obligations under the Benefit Plans relating to the participation thereunder by
current and former employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries (and their
covered dependents) provided, however, that the Purchasers shall pay to the
Sellers all actual costs incurred by the Sellers and their Affiliates with
respect to the participation in the applicable Benefit Plans by employees (net
of applicable stop-loss reimbursements and employee contributions) of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) for the period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date and ending on the Coverage Date,
including, but not limited to claims for medical or health benefits which are
incurred during such period. In the case of any hospital stay that commences on
or prior to the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the Purchasers
shall pay to the Sellers all actual costs incurred by the Sellers and their
Affiliates with respect to such hospital stay which are incurred after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, a medical or health claim shall be
deemed to be incurred as of the date the services are performed. The Purchasers
shall be responsible for and shall have the liability and obligation to provide
continuation coverage required under COBRA (and any applicable state laws) to
employees and former employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (and
their covered dependents) with respect to whom a qualifying event (or other
event giving rise to an entitlement to such continuing coverage) occurs after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that if a qualifying event (or other event
giving rise to an entitlement to continuing coverage) occurs after the Closing
Date and on or prior to the Coverage Date with respect to an employee of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries (or their covered dependents), the applicable
qualified beneficiary shall be provided with COBRA coverage under the applicable
Benefit Plan for the period beginning on the date of the qualifying event (or
such other event) and ending on the Coverage Date (or such shorter period
required by COBRA or other applicable law) and the Purchasers shall pay to the
Sellers all actual costs incurred by the Sellers and their Affiliates with
respect such coverage. After the Coverage Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall have no obligation or responsibility to


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

provide COBRA coverage (or continuing coverage under any applicable state law)
under any Benefit Plan or otherwise to any employees or former employees of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries (and their covered dependents) with respect to
whom a qualifying event (or other event giving rise to an entitlement to such
continuing coverage) occurs after the Closing Date. The Sellers and their
Affiliates shall retain all liability and obligation to provide COBRA coverage
(or continuing coverage under any applicable state law) under any Benefit Plan
or otherwise to any employees or former employees of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries (and their covered dependents) with respect to whom a qualifying
event (or other event giving rise to an entitlement to such continuing coverage)
occurs on or prior to the Closing Date.

           (b) Effective as of the Coverage Date, Sellers agree to take all
actions that they deem necessary to cause the employees of the Company and their
Subsidiaries who are participants in 401(k) plans maintained by Sellers or their
affiliates ("Sellers' 401(k) Plans") to have a fully vested and nonforfeitable
             ---------------------
interest in their respective account balances thereunder. Purchasers agree that
employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries who receive an eligible
rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 402(f)(2) of the Code) from
the Sellers' 401(k) Plans shall, subject to the provisions of section 402 of the
Code, be permitted to make a rollover contribution to a 401(k) plan maintained
by Purchasers and their affiliates. To the extent that, pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b), an employee of the Companies or
their Subsidiaries is eligible to make a rollover contribution of a direct
rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 401(a)(31) of the Code and
the regulations thereunder) to a 401(k) plan of Purchasers or their affiliates,
such rollover contribution may include promissory notes for loans made to such
employee under the terms of the Sellers' 401(k) Plans.

     10.12 Retained Matters. The Parties acknowledge and agree that as of the
           ----------------
Closing Date, the Sellers shall retain full and total responsibility for and
control of any and all Retained Liabilities and Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities (the latter being subject to the applicable provisions of Article
                                                                      -------
IX), including certain actions, proceedings, Tax audits or investigations to
--
which Sellers or their Affiliates are subject relating to such Retained
Liabilities and Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities (collectively, the
"Retained Matters").
 ----------------

           (a) The Sellers do not have, and following the Closing Date, will not
have any claim against the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates for any Loss
which the Sellers incur due to any of the Retained Matters; provided, however,
(i) the Sellers may recover from the Purchasers the actual court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with compelling the
cooperation described in this Section 10.12 or otherwise incurred due to a
                              -------------
breach by the Purchasers of its obligations under this Section 10.12. Subject to
                                                       -------------
the applicable provisions of Article IX with respect to Pre-Closing
                             ----------
Environmental Liabilities, the Parties intend that all responsibility for and
control of the Retained Matters transfer to or remain with (as the case may be)
the Sellers, as of the Closing Date, without further action on the part of the
Parties, except for the duties of cooperation described in this Section 10.12.
                                                                -------------

           (b) Subsequent to the Closing, the Purchasers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates (including the Companies) to, reasonably cooperate with and
assist the Sellers in their defense of any Retained Matter. Such cooperation
shall include, without limitation, retaining documents related to the Retained
Matter as the Sellers shall reasonably request and causing employees of the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including the Companies) to make


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

themselves available to the Sellers and their counsel during normal business
hours, for interviews and depositions relating to the Retained Matters.

           (c) Subject to the applicable provisions of Article IX with respect
to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, in taking the actions permitted or
required under this Section 10.12, the Sellers shall act, at Sellers' expense,
                    -------------
on behalf of the Purchasers and their Affiliates (including the Companies) and
shall have the sole authority (including without limitation, settlement
authority and the authority to approve and cause the filing of pleadings, briefs
and other documents on behalf of the Purchasers and their Affiliates) and the
responsibility for and exercise sole and complete control of the Retained
Matters; provided, however, the Sellers shall not have the right to assume
         --------  -------
control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained
by the Purchasers, if the claim over which the Sellers seek to assume control
(i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal
allegations, (iii) involves a claim to which the Purchasers reasonably believe
an adverse determination would be detrimental to or injure the Purchaser's
reputation or future business prospects, or (iv) involves a claim which, upon
petition by the Purchasers, the appropriate court rules that the Sellers failed
or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend. Upon the written request of
Sellers, the Purchasers shall cause an executive officer of the Purchasers or
their Affiliates (including the Companies) (as applicable) to execute documents,
including settlement agreements with respect to the Retained Matter, as may be
reasonably requested by the Sellers; provided, however, such officer shall not
                                     --------  -------
be obligated to execute any document which, in his good faith belief, is not
contrary to applicable law.

     10.13 Lien Releases; Good Standing. Sellers shall, or shall cause their
           ----------------------------
Affiliates or their representatives to, obtain releases of any and all Liens
(except Permitted Encumbrances) held by third parties against property of the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as of the Closing other than Liens
associated with an Assumed Liability (which shall include, by way of example,
(a) Liens on assets used by the Companies pursuant to operating leases and (b)
Liens on assets held by the Companies pursuant to re-rental agreements), all on
terms reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasers and their senior lenders. BESI
Holding shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or its representatives to, use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Companies to promptly cause BESI
to be in good standing in any state in which it conducts business as of the
Closing Date.

     10.14 Guarantees. Purchasers and the Purchaser Guarantor will cooperate
           ----------
with and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain a full and unconditional
release of all BESI Guarantees, including by agreeing to enter into a
replacement guarantee in favor of any third party creditor who is a beneficiary
of such BESI Guarantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "BESI Guarantees" means
                                                         ---------------
any guarantee, indemnity, performance bond, letter of credit (and any related
contract), deposit or other security or contingent obligation in the nature of a
financial obligation, including letters of comfort or support entered into or
granted by a Seller or any of Affiliates of a Seller (other than any Company or
any Subsidiary) with respect to any Assumed Liability; provided that the
                                                       -------- ----
Purchasers and the Purchaser Guarantor shall not be required to post any
collateral, grant any security interest or pay any fees with respect to any of
the foregoing.

provided that in the event of such an assignment, the Purchasers shall remain
-------- ----
liable for their obligations and liabilities under this Agreement.

     11.4 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
          ------------
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
