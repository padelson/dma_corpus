decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall (the " _Closing
Net Working Capital_ _Adjustment_ "). 17

 

(b) No later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer a statement setting
forth the Companys good faith estimate of the Closing Cash, along with a
reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof on a
consolidated basis (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ").

 

(c) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Initial
Statement_ ") calculating and setting forth (A)(i) the Adjusted Working
Capital as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the Closing Date and (ii) the difference between such amount and
the Preliminary Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount (such difference set
forth on the Initial Statement, which may be a positive or negative number,
the " _Initial Net Working Capital_ _Amount_ "), and (B)(i) the Closing
Cash and (ii) the difference between such amount and the Estimated Closing
Cash (such difference set forth on the Initial Statement, which may be a
positive or negative number, the " _Initial Cash Amount_ "), which statement
shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how each such
amount was calculated. The Initial Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial
Statements.

 

(d) During the 30 days immediately following the Stockholder Representatives
receipt of the Initial Statement (the " _Equity Consideration Adjustment
Review_ _Period_ "), the Stockholder Representative and its representatives
shall be permitted to review Buyers working papers and working papers of
Buyers independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the
Initial Statement and the calculation of the Initial Net Working
Capital Amount and the Initial Cash Amount and Buyer shall make reasonably
available to the Stockholder Representative the individuals responsible for
and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation or
calculation of, the Initial Statement, the Initial Net Working Capital Amount
and the Initial Cash Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent
accountants of Buyer shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the Stockholder Representative unless and until the Stockholder
Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall, prior to the Closing, and Buyer
shall, following the Closing through the date that (i) the Final Working
Capital Amount becomes such in accordance with the penultimate sentence of
Section 3.3(h) and (ii) the Final Closing Cash Amount becomes such
in accordance with the last sentence of Section 3.3(h), take all actions
reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve all accounting books and
records, policies and procedures on which the Initial Statement is based so
as not to impede or delay the determination of the Initial Net Working
Capital Amount or the Final Working Capital Amount and the Initial Cash
Amount or the Final Closing Cash Amount, respectively, or the preparation of
the Notice of Equity Consideration Adjustment Disagreement in the manner and
utilizing the methods permitted by this Agreement. 18

 

(f) The Stockholder Representative shall notify Buyer in writing (the "
_Notice_ _of Equity Consideration Adjustment Disagreement_ ") prior to the
expiration of the Equity Consideration Adjustment Review Period if the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Initial Statement, the Initial
Net Working Capital Amount or the Initial Cash Amount. The Notice of Equity
Consideration Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the Stockholder
Representatives determination of the amount of the Initial Net Working
Capital Amount or Initial Cash Amount, respectively, with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation. If no Notice of Equity Consideration Adjustment
Disagreement is received by Buyer on or prior to the expiration date of the
Equity Consideration Adjustment Review Period, then the Initial Net Working
Capital Amount and Initial Cash Amount, respectively, set forth in
the Initial Statement shall each be deemed to have been accepted by the
Stockholder Representative and shall each become final and binding upon the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 3.3(h) .

 

(g) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Equity Consideration Adjustment Disagreement (the " _Equity Consideration
Adjustment Consultation_ _Period_ "), the Stockholder Representative and
Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Equity Consideration
Adjustment Disagreement.

 

(h) If, at the end of the Equity Consideration Adjustment Consultation
Period, the Stockholder Representative and Buyer have been unable to resolve
all disagreements that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Equity Consideration Adjustment Disagreement, then the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall submit all matters that remain
in dispute with respect to the Notice of Equity Consideration
Adjustment Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Statement marked to
indicate those line items that are in dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(the " _Independent Accountant_ "). In the event that the Independent
Accountant refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent
Accountant, the Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in the
United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the Stockholder
Representative and Buyer, in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean
such firm. Within 30 days after the submission of such matters to the
Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent
Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final
determination, binding on the Stockholder Representative and Buyer, in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial
Statements and this Section 3.3(h), of the appropriate amount of each of the
line items in the Initial Statement as to which the Stockholder
Representative and Buyer disagree as specified in the Notice of Equity
Consideration Adjustment Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line
item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
the Stockholder Representative or Buyer, shall not be in excess of
the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the
Stockholder Representative in the Notice of Equity Consideration Adjustment
Disagreement or Buyer in the Initial Statement with respect to such disputed
line item. The Independent Accountant shall not review any line items or make
any determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Notice of Equity Consideration Adjustment Disagreement that remain in
dispute. The determination of the Adjusted Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date that is
final and binding on the Stockholder Representative and Buyer, as determined
either through agreement of the Stockholder Representative and Buyer or
pursuant to Section 3.3(f) or (h), is referred to herein as the " _Final
Working Capital Amount_ ". The determination of Closing Cash that is final
and binding on the Stockholder Representative and Buyer, as determined either
through agreement of the Stockholder Representative and Buyer or pursuant to
Section 3.3(f) or (h), is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Cash Amount_ ". 19

 

(i) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination shall
be borne by the party who is not the prevailing party in the dispute. For
example, if the Stockholder Representative challenges items underlying the
calculation of the Final Working Capital Amount in the net amount of
$100,000, but the Independent Accountant determined the
Stockholder Representative has a valid claim for $50,001 or more of the
$100,000, the Stockholder Representative shall bear none of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant and Buyer shall bear 100% of such fees
and expenses;  _but_ if the Independent Accountant determined that the
Stockholder Representative has a valid claim for $49,999 or less of the
$100,000, the Stockholder Representative shall bear 100% of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant and Buyer shall bear none of such fees
and expenses. During the review by the Independent Accountant, Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative shall each make available to the Independent
Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records and work
papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to
fulfill its obligations under Section 3.3(h); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the independent accountants of the Stockholder Representative or Buyer shall
not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to
working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants.

 

(j) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Buyer shall pay
in cash to the Stockholder Representative and the Paying Agent on behalf of
the Holders the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment (which amount shall be
distributed to the Holders pro-rata). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a
negative amount, then the Escrow Agent shall pay in cash to Buyer the
amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Stockholder Representative and the Paying Agent or
Buyer (as applicable) within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working
Capital Amount and Final Closing Cash Amount each have become such, together
with interest thereon, from the Closing Date through the date on which the
Post-Closing Adjustment is paid, at the Interest Rate calculated on a 365-day
basis for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which interest is payable.

 

 _Section 3.4._ _Closing of the Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Common Stock shall thereafter be made. 20

 

 _Section 3.5._ _Stockholder Consent_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Stockholder Consent has been
executed and delivered, and a copy thereof has been delivered to the Company
and Buyer.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by the Holders who have not voted in
favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded
and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ",
respectively) shall not be cancelled and converted pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 3.1 hereof, and the holders thereof shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect
or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder\'s rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares in respect of
which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and
converted, at the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of Section
3.1. The Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer of any demands received by
the Company for appraisals of shares, and Buyer shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

 

 _Section 3.6._ _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall withhold or deduct from amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax Law, and shall duly pay such amounts to the proper Governmental
Authority. Such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipients in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent.

maintained outside of the United States (such plans hereinafter
being referred to collectively as " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ "). The term "
_Benefit Plan_ " means each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of _ERISA_ ), employment and similar agreements, and each

any liability, contingent or otherwise.

 

(b) Each Benefit Plan is in material compliance with all applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code, and all other applicable Laws and has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all
such applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an "
_ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is intended to be qualified within the meaning
of Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination
letter under Section 401(b) of the Code within the applicable remedial
period, and nothing, to the Knowledge of the Company, has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the qualification of such
ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to a

Plans, other than ordinary and usual claims for benefits by participants and
beneficiaries.

Section 4980B of the Code, no Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits after an
employees or directors termination of service.

 

(e) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.14(e)_ , the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder
will not (i) entitle any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to severance pay, accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of any payment or funding of compensation or benefits, or increase
the amount payable under any Benefit Plan or (ii) constitute a triggering
event under any Benefit Plan (excluding for these purposes the Employment and
Non-Competition Agreements dated as of the date hereof between Merger Sub and
each Key Executive) which would result in any material payment which could
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) to any present or former employee, director
or individual consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(f) All stock options granted by the Company and any Company Subsidiary to
any current or former employee or director have been granted with a per share
exercise or reference price at least equal to the fair market value of the
underlying stock on the date the option was granted, within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury Department guidance.

 

(g) No Benefit Plan is a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
member of their ERISA Affiliates has at any time sponsored or contributed to,
or has or had any liability or obligation in respect of, any
Multiemployer Plan that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(h) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.14(h), neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has or is reasonably expected to incur any material
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA with respect to any

of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them or any ERISA Affiliate.  31

 

 (i) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.14(i), the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any Pension
Plan, non-qualified deferred compensation, supplemental or excess plans, or
any post retirement life, health or other welfare benefits.

 

 (j) All material contributions, premiums, Taxes, expenses and benefit
payments required to be made under or in connection with any Benefit Plan have
been properly and timely made when due or are appropriately accrued in
accordance with GAAP or, with respect to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, in
accordance with local accounting standards.

of the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other

moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally
and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity), each such Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company

incentive bonus opportunity and long-term incentive opportunity (the "
_Compensation Package_ "), which, in the aggregate and with respect to each

provided to a similarly situated employee of Buyer;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not prevent the Surviving Corporation from making any
modifications or substitutions of the employee benefits from time to time in
the ordinary and usual course as long as such modifications or substitutions
do not breach the foregoing covenant. With respect to any employee benefits
that are provided to Company Group Employees under the Surviving Corporation's
employee benefits plans (" _Buyer Plans_ "), service accrued by Company Group
Employees during employment with the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the Closing Date shall be recognized for

such time under the comparable plan maintained or sponsored by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to be taken into account under such Buyer Plan for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket and similar provisions. Subject to compliance with Section 7.7(b) and
any applicable obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
nothing in this Section 7.7(a) shall limit the right of the Surviving

dental and life insurance arrangements (each, an " _Employee Arrangement_ ")
for the benefit of any Company Group Employees, in each case consistent with
the terms of the applicable Employee Arrangement. For a one year period
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall provide severance
benefits to Company Group Employees who are terminated during such period that
are no less favorable to such Company Group Employee than the severance
benefits to which such Company Group Employee was entitled to receive
immediately prior to the date hereof.

 

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) maintain the 2011 Annual Bonus Plan
(the " _Annual Bonus Plan_ ") through September 30, 2011 and (ii) in

covenant is given within the Applicable Survival Period for such

  _Section 9.2._ _Indemnification_.

 

 (a) Subject to Sections 9.1 and 9.4 hereof, the Holders to the extent of the
Escrow Funds shall indemnify and hold Buyer and Merger Sub and their
respective directors, officers, Affiliates, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and
against, and pay, out of the Escrow Funds, to the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Parties the amount of, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, obligations,
deficiencies, demands, judgments, damages, interest, fines, penalties,
claims, suits, actions, causes of action, assessments, awards, costs and
expenses (including costs of investigation and defense and attorneys and
other professionals fees), whether or not involving a third party claim
(individually, a " _Loss_ " and, collectively, " _Losses_ "): 53

 

(i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company or the Stockholder
Representative in this Agreement to be true and correct, without giving
effect to any qualifications or limitations as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect (or other similar materiality qualifiers) therein (other than
Sections 4.4 (clause (c) only), 4.6 (clause (d) only), 4.16 and 4.23), in all
respects at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date;

 

(ii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the breach of any covenant

knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

 

 _Section 9.3._ _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A claim for indemnification of Losses for any matter not involving a
third party claim may be asserted by notice, which provides any known detail
with respect to such claim, to the party from whom indemnification is sought
promptly after the incurrence of such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not preclude the indemnified
party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this
Article 9, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby.   54

 

 (b) In the event that any Action shall be instituted or that any claim or
demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under Section 9.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 9.4) (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity
to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the indemnified
party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not
release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's obligations with
respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the provisions of this Section
9.3, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ that the indemnifying party
shall have acknowledged in writing to the indemnified party its unqualified
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party as provided hereunder. If the
indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified by it
hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days of the indemnified party's written
notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of
the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent
to do so; _provided_ that the indemnifying party must conduct the defense of
the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve
its rights in this regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified party defends
any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the
indemnified party for the reasonable expenses of defending such Third Party
Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim. The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to the other to
such documents and information as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant or
claimants and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release
from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of
the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim.  55

  

 (c) Under all circumstances the Holders shall act solely through the
Stockholder Representative and Stockholder Representative's determination with
respect to all matters under this Article 9 (including a determination as to
whether to seek indemnity or not) shall be final and binding on each Holder.

 

  _Section 9.4._ _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

 (a) An indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section
9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the indemnified parties and indemnifiable thereunder based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the failure of any of the representations
or warranties to be true and correct exceeds $500,000 (the " _Deductible_ ")
and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay only the
amount of such indemnifiable Losses incurred in excess of the Deductible;
_provided_ that no claim for an indemnifiable Loss shall be indemnifiable to
the extent such Loss does not exceed $10,000; _provided_ _further_ , however,
that the limitations on indemnification in this Section 9.4(a) shall not
apply to Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of
any of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 of this Agreement to be true and
correct, without giving effect to any qualifications or limitations as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect (or other similar materiality
qualifiers) therein, in all respects at and as of the date hereof and at and
as of the Closing Date.

 

 (b) In no event shall the Holders or Buyer be required to indemnify any
Person under this Agreement in respect of Losses for an aggregate amount that
exceeds the Escrow Funds in the case of indemnification by the Holders and
$8,500,000 in the case of indemnification by Buyer (the " _Cap_ "). The right
of the Buyer to indemnification or any other payment pursuant to this
Agreement shall be limited to the Escrow Funds then held in escrow pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement and not previously distributed pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and no indemnification or other payment shall be payable
other than for the remaining Escrow Funds.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9, no
indemnification shall be provided under this Agreement with respect to any
Losses based on punitive, consequential or special damages; _provided_ that
indemnifiable Losses may include punitive, consequential or special damages
to the extent that they are actually adjudicated as due and actually paid by
an indemnified party to a third party who is not a party (or a director,
officer, Affiliate, successor or assignee of a party) to this Agreement in
connection with an indemnified Third Party Claim.

 

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, no indemnification shall be provided under
this Agreement with respect to underfunding liabilities under the Gold Toe
Retirement Plan-Cash Balance Plan.

 

  _Section 9.5._ _Tax Indemnification_.

  

 (a) Subject to Sections 9.1 and 9.4 hereof, except to the extent treated as
a Current Liability in the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital, the
Holders, to the extent of and only out of the Escrow Funds, shall be liable
for and indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for all Taxes (other than
Taxes resulting from a transaction (or actions of Buyer or its Affiliates)
outside of the ordinary course of business that occurs on the Closing Date but
after the Closing) imposed on the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries may
otherwise be liable for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable year or period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of
such taxable year ending on and including the Closing Date. Except to the
extent treated as a Current Asset in the calculation of Adjusted Working
Capital, the Holders shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary receives for such periods.   56

  

 (b) For purposes of Section 9.5(a), whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for
a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or the
Company Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on, and the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be
determined by assuming that the Company or Company Subsidiary had a taxable
year or period which ended at the close of the Closing Date; provided that,
each of (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis (such as property Taxes), shall be apportioned on a time
basis.

 

 (c) Buyer shall promptly notify the Holders in writing upon receipt by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, the Company or Company Subsidiaries of notice of
any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise
tax audits or assessments which may materially affect the tax liabilities of
the Company or Company Subsidiaries for which the Holders would be required to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to Article IX (a "Tax Claim"); provided that failure
to comply with this provision shall not affect the Buyer Indemnified Parties'
right to indemnification hereunder unless the Holders are materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

 (d) The Holders shall have the right, at their own cost and expense, to
control any Tax Claim; provided that, (i) Buyer may participate at its own
cost and expense, and (ii) as to any Tax Claim with respect to a Straddle
Period, the Holders and Buyer shall jointly control such Tax Claim, each at
their own cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders shall
not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement
of litigation, any Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 

 (e) The indemnifications set forth in this Section 9.5 shall survive for
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate.   57

 

  _Section 9.6._ _Losses Net of Insurance and Taxes_. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under Section 9.2 or 9.5, shall be net
of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party (net of any
costs of investigation of the underlying claim and of collection) pursuant to
any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any Person (other
than this Agreement), (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of any costs of
investigation of the underlying claim and of collection and net of any
increase premiums) received as an offset against such Loss and (iii) any
amount equal to any Tax benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any
Loss to the party claiming such Loss or indemnification (each course of
recovery referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) a "Collateral Source"). If the
amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a Collateral Source from any
payment required under Section 9.2 or 9.5 is received after payment by the
indemnifying party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
indemnified party pursuant to this Article 9, the indemnified party shall
repay the indemnifying party, promptly after such receipt, any amount that the
indemnifying party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article 9 had
such receipt occurred at the time of such payment. Each indemnified party
shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses as soon as
reasonably practicable after such indemnified party becomes aware of any
event which does, or could reasonably be expect to, give rise to any such
Losses. 

  

  _Section 9.7._ _Indemnity Escrow_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall, on
behalf of the Holders and pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2, pay to
the Escrow Agent, as agent to Buyer and the Holders, the Escrow Funds, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which
will be executed at the Closing in a form to be agreed between Buyer and the
Company promptly after the date of this Agreement, by and among Buyer,
Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Funds in accordance with, and subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, which shall, among other
things, provide that, upon the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
balance of the Escrow Funds (after taking into account the Post-Closing
Adjustment), if any, will be released to the Holders pro-rata, with interest
thereon, from the Closing Date through such date, paid at an interest rate
that is calculated on a 365-day basis for the actual number of days (including
the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which
interest is payable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Escrow Funds shall be
released to the Holders to the extent that the then-remaining Escrow Funds may
be required to satisfy any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
9 that has been brought as of such date and which has not been finally
resolved. To the extent Escrow Funds are distributed to the Holders,
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to be reimbursed solely from such
distributed Escrow Funds for all out-of-pocket costs (including attorney's
fees) for administering claims relating to Losses.

 

  _Section 9.8._ _Purchase Price Adjustment_. All amounts paid from the
Escrow Funds or otherwise pursuant to this Article 9, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Equity
Consideration for all Tax purposes.

  _Section 10.1._ _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

 

 (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

 

 (b) by either Buyer or the Company upon written notice to the other if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 1, 2011 (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to a party
if the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date shall be primarily
due to such party's failure to perform or comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement;   58

 

 (c) by either Buyer or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable;

 

 (d) by Buyer if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.3(a) or 8.3(b)
would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is not capable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior
to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following notice of such breach to the
Company and (ii) the Outside Date;  _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) if Buyer is
then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement; or

 

 (e) by the Company if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or
8.2(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is not
capable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following notice of such
breach to Buyer and Merger Sub and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

  _Section 10.2._ _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as
provided in Section 10.1, then except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation hereunder to any other
party hereto, except (i) for damages for any breach by such Person of any
covenant or agreement of such Person set forth in this Agreement (it being
understood that in calculating damages for claims made by the Company the
damages shall take into consideration damages to the Holders as a result of
such breach), (ii) as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement or (iii) as
provided in this Section 10.2 and in Article 11.

 

 ARTICLE 11

 

  _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

  _Section 11.1._ _Amendment and Modifications_. This Agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented at any time by the parties hereto prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ (i) such amendment, modification or supplement
shall only be made by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
parties hereto and (ii) no such amendment shall be made which by Law requires
the further approval of the Holders without such further approval. 59

 

 _Section 11.2._ _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) Pursuant to the Stockholder Consent, each Holder irrevocably appointed
BCP (the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") as such Stockholders
representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution
to act in the name, place and stead of such Holder with respect to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to act on behalf of such Holder
in any amendment of or litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts
and things, and to execute all such documents, as such Stockholder
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger, this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, including the power:

 

(i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver
of any condition to the obligations of the Holders to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

 

(ii) to negotiate, execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, statements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be
given in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that such Holder
shall execute and deliver any such documents which Stockholder Representative
agrees to execute);

 

(iii) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with the any claims under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including
service of process in connection with arbitration; and

 

(iv) to take all actions which under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
may be taken by the Holders and to do or refrain from doing any further act
or deed on behalf of the Holder which Stockholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as fully and completely as
such Holder could do if personally present.

 

Notwithstanding the above, the Stockholder Representative may not amend this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to (i) create any personal liability of any
Holder hereunder or thereunder, (ii) to increase the maximum aggregate
indemnification obligation of the Holders beyond the Escrow Funds or (iii)
take any action pursuant hereto that could disproportionately affect
any Holder or group of the Holders without the prior consent of such affected
Holder or group of the Holders.

 

If BCP becomes unable to serve as Stockholder Representative such other
Person or Persons as may be designated by a majority of the Holders, shall
succeed as Stockholder Representative. 60

 

 _Section 11.3._ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
parties hereto entitled to the benefits of the respective term or provision
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance
with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
party not entitled to the benefits of such extended or waived term or
provision. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

 

 _Section 11.4._ _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (b)
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the
prior written consent of the parties hereto.

 

 _Section 11.5._ _Validity_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of any other provision of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full
force and effect, and the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrive at an accommodation which effectuates to the greatest
extent legally permissible the intent of the parties with respect to the
benefits and obligations of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

 

 _Section 11.6._ _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if delivered personally, telecopied (which is confirmed) or sent

or to such other address as the Person to whom notice is given may have

_provided_ that notice of any change of address shall be effective only upon

 _Section 11.7._ _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and
have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a
consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules
relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.   62

 

  _Section 11.8._ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING

AGREEMENT.

 

  _Section 11.9._ _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult
to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance
of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

 

  _Section 11.10._ _Publicity_. None of the parties and their respective
Representatives shall issue any news release or make any public announcement
concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
without the advance approval thereof by each of Buyer, the Company and
Stockholder Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that any party (or its
respective Representatives) may make any public disclosure that it reasonably
believes, upon advice of its outside counsel, is required by applicable Laws
or stock exchange requirements, in which case the disclosing party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to advise the other party or parties (including
Stockholder Representative) of such disclosure as soon as practicable and, in
any event, at least concurrently with making such disclosure; _provided_ ,
_further_ that after the Closing any party (or its respective Representatives)
may issue a news release or make a public announcement concerning this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger after providing the other party or
parties (including Stockholder Representative) with reasonable prior notice
thereof and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Subject to the
prior sentence, each of Buyer, the Company and Stockholder Representative
shall cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of all
news releases and other public announcements that are to be issued on or prior
to the Business Day immediately following the Closing Date with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

  _Section 11.11._ _Alternative Dispute Resolution_. The parties or relevant
third party beneficiaries, as the case may be, shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly
by negotiations between executives who have authority to settle the
controversy. Any Person may give the other relevant Persons written notice of
any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within twenty (20)
days after delivery of said notice, executives of all relevant Persons shall
meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they
reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to
resolve the dispute. If the matter has not been resolved within thirty (30)
days of the disputing Person's original notice, or if the relevant Persons
fail to meet within twenty (20) days, any party or affected third party
beneficiary may initiate legal proceedings to resolve the controversy or
claim. If a Person's negotiator intends to be accompanied at a meeting by an
attorney or is an attorney, the other negotiators shall be given at least
three (3) working days' notice of such intention and may be accompanied by an
attorney. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and shall
be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence.   63

 

  _Section 11.12._ _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Each of the parties agrees that if any dispute is not
resolved pursuant to Section 11.11, such dispute shall be resolved only in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware. In that context, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating
to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State
of Delaware, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be
heard and determined in such Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or
any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware; (b) consents
that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and waives any
objection that it may now or thereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of
any such Action in any such court or that such Action was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) waives all
right to trial by jury in any Action (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or its performance
under or the enforcement of this Agreement; (d) agrees that service of process
in any such Action may be effected by mailing a copy of such process by
registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail),
postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section 11.6; and
(e) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

 

  _Section 11.13._ _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

  _Section 11.14._ _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties
that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in
which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

 

  _Section 11.15._ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.   64

 

  _Section 11.16._ _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, all legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Person
incurring such expenses.

 

  _Section 11.17._ _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
or their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not limit the right of each of the current and former directors, officers,
agents and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from being a
direct and irrevocable third party beneficiary of the agreement and covenant
contained in Section 7.6 with the right to enforce such agreement and
covenant as fully as if such director or officer was a party hereto.

 

 [the remainder of this page is intentionally left blank] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.
