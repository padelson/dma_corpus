pursuant to Section 11.11, such dispute shall be resolved only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware. In that context, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in such Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware; (b) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or thereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any
such Action in any such court or that such Action was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) waives all right to trial by jury in any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or its performance under or the enforcement of this Agreement; (d) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially

ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
