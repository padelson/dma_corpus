the items set forth in the Final Closing Items calculations. Sellers
Representative shall have the right for 30 days following receipt of the Final
Closing Items to object to any of the Final Closing Items or the calculation

made in writing and shall set forth such objection in reasonable detail.
Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object
under this _Section 2.4_ unless Sellers Representative furnishes its written
objections to Buyer within such 30-day period. If Sellers Representative
delivers an objection within such 30-day period, then Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections. If, at
the end of a 15-day period from the date of delivery of any objection by

execute any engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Closing Item
Arbitrator may reasonably require as a condition to such engagement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to each of the Sellers Representative and
Buyer. The Closing Item Arbitrator shall determine the Final Closing
Securities Payment as promptly as reasonably practicable after the objections
that remain in dispute are submitted to the Closing Item Arbitrator, but in
any event within 30 days after such objections that remain in dispute are
submitted to the Closing Item Arbitrator. If any objections are submitted to
the Closing Item Arbitrator for resolution, (i) each of Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall furnish to the Closing Item Arbitrator such workpapers
and other documents and information relating to such objections as the Closing
Item Arbitrator may request and are reasonably available to that Party (or its
independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Closing Item Arbitrator any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with
the Closing Item Arbitrator, _provided_ that neither Sellers Representative
nor Buyer shall engage in any communication or correspondence with the Closing
Item Arbitrator outside of the presence, or without the inclusion, of the
other; (ii) the Closing Item Arbitrator must not adopt an amount of the Final
Closing Securities Payment that is greater than the amount submitted by
Sellers Representative or less than the amount submitted by Buyer; and (iii)
the determination by the Closing Item Arbitrator of the Final Closing
Securities Payment, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both Buyer
and Sellers Representative by the Closing Item Arbitrator, shall be made in
accordance with this Agreement and the Sample Balance Sheet and shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties and, absent manifest error, shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof. Buyer
and Seller shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs in connection
with any such objection; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer, on one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of
the Closing Item Arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Closing Item Arbitrator and procedures set forth herein shall be
the sole method for resolving any disputes regarding the Final Closing
Securities Payment or the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, _provided_ that
this _Section 2.4_ shall not affect the respective rights of Buyer or Seller
under _ARTICLE IX_. Following the final determination of the Final Closing
Securities Payment pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, if the Final Closing
Securities Payment is greater than the Closing Securities Payment then Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount of the Final Adjustment Amount promptly (but in
any event within five Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing
Securities Payment) or if the Closing Securities Payment is greater than the
Final Closing Securities Payment then Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of
the Final Adjustment Amount promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days of the determination of the Final Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Securities Payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Final Adjustment
Amount is: (i) to be paid to Buyer, if Seller fails to timely pay the Final
Adjustment Amount to Buyer, then each Member shall promptly (but in any event
within two Business Days following the date such payment was due from Seller)
pay to Buyer such Members pro rata percentage as set forth in _Schedule B_
of the amount of the Final Adjustment Amount that is not timely paid by Seller
or (ii) to be paid to Seller, then after such payment is made to Seller,
Seller shall immediately pay to the Members the Final Adjustment Amount in the
proportions set forth on _Schedule B_ hereto in immediately available funds by
confirmed wire transfer to the bank account or accounts designated by each
Member in writing to Seller at least three Business Days prior to payment of
the Final Adjustment Amount ( _provided_ that none of Buyer, the Company or TS
Crude shall have any liability or obligation under this proviso or for any
failure of Seller to comply herewith).

(iii) There are no examinations, audits, claims, assessments, levies, or
administrative or judicial proceedings currently pending (or proposed in

required to file any Tax Return, in that jurisdiction. All deficiencies
asserted or assessments made by any Tax Authority with respect to Seller have

(i) The Transaction Units are being acquired by Seller and (pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)(ii)_) Tall Oak for investment purposes only, for Sellers and
Tall Oaks own account and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.
Neither Seller nor Tall Oak is a party to or bound by, or intends to or has
any plans to enter into, any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer or

warranties of ENLC in _Section 5.2_.

for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration

statements (together with any exhibits to the extent filed and not furnished)
required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 2014 under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act (collectively, the " ** _SEC Documents_**
"). As of their respective dates of filing (or in the case of registration
statements, solely on the dates of effectiveness) and except to the extent
corrected by a subsequent SEC Document, the SEC Documents (A) complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and (B) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing statements, ENLC makes no representation or
warranty and shall have no liability with respect to the information in, or
exhibits to, any current report on Form 8-K of ENLC that has been "furnished"
rather than "filed" with the SEC.

respects with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act,

respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
entities purported to be shown thereby at the dates and for the periods
indicated (except, in the case of the unaudited ENLC Financial Statements, for
the absence of notes and subject to normal recurring year-end adjustments).

 



 

(iii) The books and records of ENLC and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP, which
has certified certain financial statements of ENLC and its consolidated
subsidiaries, and has audited the effectiveness of ENLCs internal control
over financial reporting and expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment thereof, whose reports appear in the SEC Documents, are independent
public accountants as required by the Securities Act. KPMG LLP is an
independent public accounting firm with respect to ENLC and has not resigned
or been dismissed as independent public accountants of ENLC.

 



 

(h) _Absence of Changes_. Except as set forth in or contemplated by the SEC
Documents or this Agreement, to the Knowledge of ENLC, since September 30,
2015 through the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred any change in
the business of the ENLC and its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had an ENLC Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(i) _Investment Company Status_. None of the EnLink Entities is now, and
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Transaction Units
hereunder none of the EnLink Entities will be, an "investment company" within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 



 

(j) _Form S-3 Eligibility_. ENLC is eligible to register the resale of the
ENLC Units for resale by the Seller under Form S-3 promulgated under the
Securities Act.

 



 

(k) _MLP Status_. As of the date hereof and for each taxable year during which
ENLK has been in existence through the date hereof, (i) ENLK is and has been
properly treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes and (ii) more than 90% of ENLKs gross income is and has been
qualifying income under Section 7704(d) of the Code.

 



 

(l) _NYSE Listing_. The ENLC Units are listed on the NYSE, and ENLC has not
received any notice of delisting.

 



 

(m) _No Brokers or Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf
of ENLC or any of its Affiliates who is entitled to any fee or commission from
ENLC or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions for which
Seller, any Member or any of their Affiliates or the Company would be liable.

Transactions and (iii) contest and resist any action or proceeding instituted
(or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Government Entity
challenging the Transactions as violating any applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , nothing in this _Section 6.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall require, or be construed to require, Buyer, the Company, Seller, Members
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to make, proffer,
propose, negotiate, offer to effect or consent, commit or agree to any sale,
divestiture, lease, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestment or other
encumbrance of, or to hold separate any assets, licenses, businesses or
interest of Buyer, the Company, Seller, Members or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates. None of the Company, Seller, Members or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall take, or agree to take, any
of the actions described in this _clause (e)_ without the prior written
consent of Buyer.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Supplemental Disclosure_. Any Disclosure Schedule may, from time
to time, prior to the tenth day prior to the Closing Date, be supplemented or
amended with respect to any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs
or first arises or with respect to which knowledge is first obtained after the
date of this Agreement, that would cause or constitute an inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation or warranty in this Agreement to which such
Disclosure Schedule relates. The Person supplementing or amending its
Disclosure Schedules (the " ** _Disclosing Party_** ") shall deliver a copy of
the amendment or supplement, which shall clearly identify and highlight the
relevant changes to such Disclosure Schedules (the " ** _Supplemental
Disclosure_** ") to the Sellers Representative, if Buyer is the Disclosing
Party, or to Buyer, if Seller, any Member or the Company is the Disclosing
Party (in each case, the " ** _Receiving Party_** "). The Receiving Party
shall have ten days after receipt of such Supplemental

 



       
 

 



 

Disclosure (the " ** _Termination Period_** ") in which to review the
Supplemental Disclosure. If a Supplemental Disclosure discloses facts that
would, in the Receiving Partys reasonable determination, constitute a breach
of the Disclosing Partys representations and warranties hereunder and such
breach would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the condition
to Closing specified in _Section 7.2(a)_, if Seller or Tall Oak is the
Disclosing Party, _Section 7.2(b)_, if FE-STACK is the Disclosing Party,
_Section 7.2(c)_, if the Company is the Disclosing Party or _Section
7.3(a)_, if Buyer is the Disclosing Party, to be satisfied at the Closing,
then Buyer, if Seller is the Disclosing Party, or the Sellers Representative,
if Buyer is the Disclosing Party, may terminate this Agreement by delivering a
written notice of termination to the others prior to the expiration of the
Termination Period (which termination notice shall specify the representation
or warranty breached, identify the specific facts in the Supplemental
Disclosure that constitute the breach and describe why the failure of the
condition to Closing would reasonably be expected to occur). If a notice of
termination is not received with respect to any Supplemental Disclosure within
the Termination Period, the Receiving Party will be deemed to have waived its
right to terminate with respect to such Supplemental Disclosure and the
relevant Disclosure Schedule will be deemed, solely for the purpose of the
Receiving Partys condition to Closing as set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_,
_Section 7.2(b)_, _Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_, as applicable, and
not for any other purpose under this Agreement (including the indemnification
provisions in _ARTICLE IX_), to be amended and supplemented as described in
the Supplemental Disclosure as of the date hereof.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Related Party Agreements_. Prior to or concurrently with the
Closing, Seller and Members shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, terminate all Contracts between Seller, any Member or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or TS Crude, on the
other hand, existing prior to the Closing (each, a " ** _Related Party
Contract_** ") without any further liability or obligation of the Company or
TS Crude thereunder, except for those Contracts listed on Section 6.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. For the purposes of this _Section 6.6_,
Affiliates of Seller shall include EnCap Affiliates.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing now existing in favor of any present or former manager, director or
officer of the Company will remain obligations of the Company and will survive
the Closing and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without consent
of Members (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), amend, restate or repeal any Organizational Documents of the
Company within six years after the Closing unless such Organizational Document
(after giving effect to such amendment, restatement or repeal and applicable
Law) would provide for the Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former manager, director and officer of the Company (in each case, when
acting in such capacity), against, and advance expenses with respect to, any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
Losses, claims, damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters in connection with
acting in such capacity, to at least the same extent that such

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification and advancement of expenses would be provided for under
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents in effect on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) For the six-year period commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
the Company to maintain in effect, through an extended reporting period
endorsement, the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
with respect to those persons who are currently (and any directors, managers
or officers of the Company who prior to the Closing Date become) covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on the same
terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and amount, for such
individuals. Buyer shall cause the Company to maintain such policy in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder as provided
herein.

 



 

(c) If the Company shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation
or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger, then Buyer shall cause proper provisions to
be made so that the successors of the Company shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(d) Seller, Members and Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that from and after
the Closing each of the present and former managers, directors and officers of
the Company shall be an express third-party beneficiary of this _Section
6.7_. The rights of such managers, directors and officers under this _Section
6.7_ shall be in addition to any rights such partners, managers, directors and
officers may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of
such managers, directors and officers under the Organizational Documents of
the Company (as amended in accordance with this _Section 6.7_), as
applicable, shall be the initial and primary basis for and means of recourse
for such managers, directors and officers with respect to the execution of
their duties up to the termination of their appointment or under, in
connection with, arising out of, resulting from or in any way related to this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document, the Transactions or any other
matter contemplated hereby or thereby, or the process leading up to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document and
the Transactions, or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, each of the
Parties shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and
delivered, such documents and other instruments and shall take, or shall cause
to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, within five Business Days of
the date upon which any change to any Subject Employees has occurred, the
Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with an updated list of the Subject
Employees. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
(such entity that makes employment offers being the " ** _Buyer Employer_** ")
shall offer employment, which shall be contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing, to each Subject Employee actively employed by Tall Oak or its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , the Buyer Employer
shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

obligated to offer employment to any Subject Employee that was not listed on
Section 4.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof or
who does not satisfy the general hiring criteria applicable to the Buyer
Employers hiring practices for similarly situated employees. Each such offer
of employment to a Subject Employee shall (i) be held open for not less than
10 Business Days after the respective offer is made, (ii) be made for a
position (by function without regard to title) substantially the same as the
existing position held by such Subject Employee and (iii) be made at an annual
base salary or hourly wage rate that is not less than the annual salary or
hourly wage rate that the Subject Employee was receiving as set forth on
Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term " ** _Continuing
Employee_** " means each individual who accepts such an offer of employment
and becomes employed by Buyer Employer in accordance with such offer. Tall Oak
agrees to release, or cause to be released, from service with Tall Oak or any
of its Affiliates, or otherwise terminate, any Continuing Employee that
accepts an offer of employment by Buyer Employer.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall cause the Buyer Employer to provide the Continuing Employees
with the same benefit plans and programs that are offered to similarly
situated employees of Buyer Employer as of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents shall continue
to participate in the same group health and welfare plans of Tall Oak and its
Affiliates in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date
through the last day of the calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs.
Buyer Employer shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting
under each compensation, retirement, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively, the "
** _Buyer Benefit Plans_** "), but not including any equity compensation
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in which any Continuing Employee
is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was
credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Benefit Plan of
the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the
extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) As of the Closing Date, Tall Oak or one of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and TS Crude) shall pay to each Continuing Employee the amount of each
such employees accrued but unused vacation and paid time off determined as of
the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) As of the Closing Date, the Company will have satisfied any obligation to
reimburse Tall Oak or any of its Affiliates for any allocated costs associated
with, incurred by or in connection with any Benefit Plan for periods through
the Closing Date, and Tall Oak and its Affiliates shall not allocate to the
Company any additional costs thereafter under any Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Tall
Oak or any of its Affiliates shall have any responsibility for, or any
liability associated with or relating to, the compensation or employee
benefits provided to employees of Buyer Employer (including any compensation
or employee benefits that accrue on and after the Closing with respect to
Continuing Employees), other than with respect to participation by Continuing

 



      
 

 



 

Employees in the group health and welfare plans of Tall Oak and its Affiliates
for the time period from the Closing Date through the last day of the calendar
month in which the Closing Date occurs as contemplated by _Section 6.9(b)_.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, Tall Oak and its Affiliates (including any
ERISA Affiliates), other than the Company or TS Crude, shall have sole
responsibility for, and any liability associated with or relating to, (i) the
employment or services (including any Change of Control Amounts), or
termination of employment or services arising in connection with any current,
former or prospective employee of Tall Oak or its Affiliates, whether or not
related to the Company Systems or the operation of the Company, or (ii) any
Benefit Plan of Tall Oak or its Affiliates, including any compensation or
employee benefits, that arose, relate to or accrued prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be deemed to (x) confer any
rights, remedies or claims upon any Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), or (y) amend any Buyer Benefit Plan or
require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue, amend, modify or terminate
any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (and any such plan may be
continued, amended, modified or terminated in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law) or (ii) preclude Buyer or any of its Affiliates from
terminating the employment of any employee at any time after the Closing in
accordance with the terms of any applicable Buyer Benefit Plan in effect or
any applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to treat the sale of the Securities by Seller for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a fully taxable sale by Seller and a
purchase by Buyer of all of the assets of the Company and TS Crude.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) The Sellers Representative will cause to be prepared and timely filed all
Tax Returns due for the Company and TS Crude for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date and shall timely pay
or cause to be timely paid all such Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return;
_provided_ , that the Sellers Representative shall submit such Tax Returns to
Buyer for Buyers review and written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) not less than 30 days prior to the due date
therefor.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare all other Tax Returns due from the Company and TS
Crude for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date and shall submit such Tax Returns to the Sellers Representative
for the Sellers Representatives review and written approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and reasonable comment not less
than 30 days prior to the due date therefor. Buyer shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments received from the Sellers Representative with
respect to such Tax Returns and then shall cause them to be executed and
timely filed. At least 5 days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns, the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of Seller) shall pay to Buyer the amount of
Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are shown due on such

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account as a
Current Liability in the final determination of Final Net Working Capital.

 



 

(c) Any cash Non-Income Tax refunds or credits against Non-Income Taxes
currently payable to which the Company or TS Crude is entitled to that relate
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are actually received in a Post-Closing Tax
Period (net of any (i) Taxes and expenses incurred in connection therewith and
(ii) Seller Taxes except to the extent such Seller Taxes are taken into
account as a Current Liability in the final determination of Final Net Working
Capital) and not otherwise taken into account as an item of Current Asset in
the final determination of Final Net Working Capital (" ** _Tax Refund
Amount_** ") shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company to, disburse to the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of
Seller) the amount of any Tax Refund Amount within 10 Business Days from
receipt thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Party has received a
notice of any threatened Seller Tax Contest or if there is any Seller Tax
Contest currently pending, then Buyer shall have no obligation to disburse any
Tax Refund Amount under this _Section 6.10(c)_ until the final and binding
resolution of such Seller Tax Contest.

 



 

(d)

 



 

(i) The Sellers Representative shall have the right, at the sole expense of
Seller, to control any audit or examination by any Tax Authority, initiate any
claim for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment,
notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating
exclusively to any Seller Taxes (" ** _Seller Tax Contest_** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers Representative and Buyer, as applicable, shall
(A) keep the Party not in control of any such Seller Tax Contest (the " **
_Non-Controlling Party_** ") reasonably informed and consult in good faith
with such Party with respect to any issue relating to such Seller Tax Contest,
(B) provide the Non-Controlling Party copies of all correspondence, notices
and other written material received from any Tax Authority with respect to
such Seller Tax Contest and shall otherwise keep such Party reasonably
apprised of material development with respect to such Seller Tax Contest, (C)
provide the Non-Controlling Party with a copy of, and an opportunity to review
and comment on, all submissions made to a Tax Authority in connection with
such Seller Tax Contest and (D) not agree to a settlement or compromise of
such Seller Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Non-
Controlling Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(ii) Each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative agrees to notify the other
Party promptly upon learning of any Seller Tax Contest and cooperate with such
other Party with respect to any Seller Tax Contest, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the applicable Party, and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the applicable Party, upon request, as promptly as practicable
and at the requesting Partys expense, such information and assistance
relating to such Seller Tax Contest (including access to books and records) as
is reasonably necessary for the preparation for such Seller Tax Contest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give prompt notice with respect
to a Seller Tax Contest will not affect the rights or obligations of the other
Party except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the
other Party was materially prejudiced.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The Final Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company and TS Crude for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income
tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Within 90 days of the final
determination of Final Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, Sellers Representative shall deliver to Buyer a schedule
allocating the Final Purchase Price and the applicable liabilities of the
Company among the assets of the Company (the " ** _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_** "). If, within 30 days of receiving the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, Buyer has not delivered a written notice of objection to Sellers
Representative, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be final and
binding on the Parties. Sellers Representative and Buyer shall file all
applicable Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner consistent with
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as finalized under this _Section
6.10(e)_, and neither Sellers Representative nor Buyer shall take any position
inconsistent with such allocation on any Tax Return, audit, examination,
investigation or similar proceeding, unless required to do so by Law.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Buyer objects in writing to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within 30 days of receiving such Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule, Sellers Representative and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve their differences; _provided_ , that if, after 30 days
from the date that Buyer provided its written objections, Sellers
Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve their differences and mutually
agree on an allocation, each Party shall be permitted to take an independent
position with respect to the purchase price allocation on its applicable Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8594) or in connection with any audit,
examination, investigation or similar proceeding related thereto.

 



 

(f) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall be
responsible for one-half of any sales, use, value added, transfer or similar
Taxes due with respect to the purchase and sale of the Securities under this
Agreement. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to minimize any such Taxes
that may be due, including filing for any applicable exemptions or relief that
may be available.

 



 

(g) Any dispute as to any matter covered by this _Section 6.10_ shall be
resolved by the Closing Item Arbitrator and the fees and expenses of the
Closing Item Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If any
dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the
party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct, but the content
of such Tax Return shall not prejudice, control or otherwise resolve the
dispute hereunder and the liability, if any, of any Party under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Payoff Letters_. In the event that the Company or TS Crude has
any Transaction Expenses or Third-Party Debt outstanding as of the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Buyer, not later than three Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Payoff Letters from each Person to whom such amounts are
owed, which Payoff Letters shall specify: (i) the aggregate amount required to
be paid to such Person to pay such obligations in full (including, in the case
of any Third-Party Debt, any and all accrued but unpaid interest, fees,
expenses, penalties and premiums relating thereto), (ii) payment instructions
for the projected Closing Date (including, in the case of any Third-Party
Debt, the per diem amount to be added thereto in the event that the actual
Closing Date is a date subsequent to the projected Closing Date) and (iii)
wire instructions to make such payment. Each Payoff Letter relating to Third-
Party Debt

 



      
 

 



 

shall obligate the creditor or payee to promptly prepare and file (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) with the appropriate Government
Entity such instructions as may be required to effect or evidence the release
of all Encumbrances securing such Third-Party Debt or shall include
authorization for the Company or another party designated by the Company to
prepare and file any such instruments.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Notices and Consents_.

 



 

(a) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to Closing,
obtain each consent and deliver each notice set forth on Section 4.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and any other consents or notices required to be
obtained or given prior to Closing with respect to the Transactions and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in obtaining such consents and
delivering such notices, _provided_ that the costs of obtaining any such
consents shall be borne by Seller.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other terms of this Agreement and without limiting the
provisions set forth in _Section 6.4_, each of the Parties hereto will give
any notices to, make any filings with, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain or assist the other Party in obtaining any authorizations, consents
and approvals of Government Entities necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Confidentiality_. Seller and the Members, for themselves and on
behalf of their Affiliates, acknowledge that, after the Closing, Buyer would
be irreparably damaged if any confidential information regarding the Company
Systems, the operation thereof or the business of the Company or TS Crude
(including information regarding the activities, finances, properties and
other assets, marketing, pricing, suppliers, customers, licensors and
licensees) were disclosed to or utilized on behalf of any other Person, and
Seller and Members, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates, covenant
and agree that they will not, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
disclose or permit to be disclosed or use or permit to be used in any way any
information relating to such confidential information unless (a) compelled to
disclose such confidential information by judicial or administrative process
or by other applicable requirements of Law, (b) Buyer has consented in advance
to the specific disclosure of such information, (c) such information is
lawfully in the possession of the third party recipient other than as a result
of a breach of this _Section 6.13_ or (d) such information is generally
available to third parties other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
6.13_. Seller and Members, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates,
as applicable, shall give Buyer prior written notice of any disclosure
pursuant to clause (a) above and cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers expense, to
limit or obtain confidential treatment of the information so required to be
disclosed.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Public Announcements_. Except as may otherwise be required by
securities Laws and public announcements or disclosures that are, in the
reasonable opinion of the party proposing to make the announcement or
disclosure, legally required to be made, there shall be no press release or
public communication concerning this Agreement or the Transactions hereby by
any Party hereto or its Affiliates except with the prior written consent of
Sellers Representative (if Buyer or one of its Affiliates is originating such
press release or communication) or Buyer (if Seller, Members or one of their
Affiliates are originating such press release or communication), in each case
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

delayed or conditioned. Buyer and Sellers Representative will consult in
advance on the necessity for, and the timing and content of, any
communications to be made to the public and, subject to legal constraints, to
the form and content of any application or report to be made to any Government
Entity that relates to this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by all of the Parties
hereto, each Parent may issue one or more press releases announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement ( _provided that_ , prior to the
public dissemination of each such press release, Parent shall provide to
Sellers Representative a draft of any such press release and an opportunity to
provide comments thereon, which comments Parent shall not unreasonably refuse
to incorporate into such disclosure), (b) after the date of this Agreement,
each Parent may file with the Securities Exchange Commission (the " ** _SEC_**
") a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose this Agreement and include a copy
of the press release and this Agreement as an attachment or exhibit to such
Form 8-K, and (c) on or after the date the financial statements of the Company
required to be filed with such Form 8-K (or other report filed by Parent with
the SEC) are available, Parent may file an amendment to such Form 8-K
attaching such financial statements as an exhibit to such Form 8-K amendment.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Distribution of Company Cash_. On the date immediately prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall distribute in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Company substantially all of the cash of the
Company and TS Crude then held in any bank accounts of the Company and TS
Crude, other than (a) an amount of cash necessary to cover outstanding
(uncleared) checks, drafts and wire transfers or similar outstanding payment
obligations and (b) an amount of cash excluded from Current Assets pursuant to
clause (v) of the definition thereof; _provided_ that if the Closing occurs on
a date after the date on which the Measurement Time occurs, the amount of cash
to be distributed shall not exceed the amount of cash held in any bank
accounts of the Company and TS Crude as of the Measurement Time minus the
amount of cash excluded from Current Assets pursuant to clause (v) of the
definition thereof.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Releases_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, (i) Seller and each Member, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates (other than the Company and TS Crude) and
their respective successors and assigns (the " ** _Member Releasing Parties_**
"), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably releases and waives any claims that
such Member Releasing Party has or may in the future have, in its capacity as
an equity holder, member, manager, director, officer, employee or similar

from or relating to actions, omissions, facts or circumstances occurring,
arising or existing at or prior to the Closing. Nothing contained

 



      
 

 



 

in this _Section 6.16(a)_ is intended to, nor does it, limit, impair or
otherwise modify or affect any rights or obligations of the Member Releasing
Parties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
the Agreement of Members and Seller, dated of even date herewith, by and among
the Members and Seller (the " ** _Member Side Agreement_** "), or any facts,
circumstances or claims to the extent entitling a Member Releasing Party to

terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_, none of Seller, the Members, the
Company or TS Crude will, and will not permit any of their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage any
inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any non-public
information to, or consider the merits of any unsolicited inquiries or

any transaction involving the sale of the business or assets (other than as
permitted herein) of the Company or TS Crude, the sale of the Securities or
the equity interests of TS Crude or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or TS Crude.

(f) From and after the date hereof and continuing after the Closing, Seller
and Tall Oak will cooperate, and Seller and Tall Oak will cause their
Affiliates to cooperate in a timely manner, with Buyer, at Buyers sole cost

be

 



       
 

 



 

included by Parent in reports filed by it under the Exchange Act or (ii) in
connection with the financing or public or Rule 144A offering of securities by

requested by Buyer or Parent that the Full Financial Statements and 2015

Section 6.19 _Parent Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) (i) Subject to the ENLC Percentage Limit, ENLC hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees, and (ii) subject to the ENLK Percentage Limit,
ENLK hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller and the
Members the prompt and full performance and discharge by Buyer of any of
Buyers monetary obligations under this Agreement to the extent occurring at
or prior to the Closing (the " ** _Closing Guaranty_** "), and Parent
covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such
performance and discharge by Buyer hereunder (the " ** _Closing Obligations_**
"); and

 



 

(ii) ENLK hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees Buyers monetary
obligations with respect to the Subsequent Securities Payment (the " ** _Post-
Closing Guaranty_** " and, together with the Closing Guaranty, the " **
_Parent Guaranty_** "), and ENLK covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to ensure such performance and discharge by Buyer
hereunder (the " ** _Post-Closing Obligations_** " and, together with the
Closing Obligations, the " ** _Buyer Obligations_** ").

 



 

No failure or delay or lack of demand, notice or diligence in exercising any
right under this Parent Guaranty shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right under this Parent
Guaranty. The Closing Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and actions may be
brought hereunder against any or all of Buyer, ENLK and/or ENLC, as
applicable, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the others
or any of the others is joined in such action (which shall include the right
to proceed, at Sellers or any Members option, directly against ENLK and/or
ENLC, as applicable). The Post-Closing Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional
and continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and
actions may be brought hereunder against any or both of Buyer or ENLK
irrespective of whether any action is brought against the other or the other
is joined in such action (which shall include the right to proceed, at
Sellers or any Members option, directly against ENLK).

 



 

(b) The Buyer Obligations have been, and shall conclusively be deemed to have
been, created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon the Parent Guaranty and
all dealing between Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller and the
Members, on the other hand,

 



      
 

 



 

have been and shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been consummated
in reliance upon this Parent Guaranty. Parent acknowledges that it will
receive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the Members hereby covenant and
agree that Parent may assert, as a defense to such payment or performance by
Buyer, or as an affirmative claim against Seller, the Members or their
respective Affiliates, or any Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any
of them, any rights, remedies, set-offs and defenses that Buyer could assert
(subject to a "final determination" (as defined in _Section 9.7_) with
respect to any Interim Indemnity Obligation) pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or pursuant to applicable Law in connection therewith (including any
breach by Seller, the Members or the Company of this Agreement).

 



 

(d) Each of ENLC and ENLK has all legal right, power, authority and capacity
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by each of ENLC and ENLK of
this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized and approved. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of ENLC and ENLK and is
a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
Buyer shall be irrevocably obligated to pay to Seller the Subsequent
Securities Payment in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.3(e)_ and
_Section 2.3(f)_. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall be obligated to pay Seller the Subsequent Securities Payment in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.3(e)_ and _Section 2.3(f)_
notwithstanding any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, any
Member, the Company, Buyer or any other Person, except as applicable in
connection with the deductions to the Subsequent Securities Payment expressly
provided for in the definition of "First Subsequent Securities Payment". The
full amount of the Subsequent Securities Payment (for clarity, as determined
after giving effect to the deductions to the Subsequent Securities Payment
expressly provided for in the definition of "First Subsequent Securities
Payment") shall be paid in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.3(e)_ and
_Section 2.3(f)_ without any reduction for any reason including any claim of
or reduction for set off (including any such claim arising out of a breach or
alleged breach of this Agreement).

 



 

(f) Buyer, ENLK and any other party obligated to pay, or liable for payment
of, the Subsequent Securities Payment or any part thereof waive notice,
presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of protest and non-payment or
dishonor, notice of acceleration, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
intent to demand, diligence in collecting, grace, and all other formalities of
any kind, and consent to all extensions without notice for any period or
periods of time all without prejudice to Seller. Seller shall similarly have
the right to deal in any way, at any time, with one or more of the foregoing
parties without notice to any other party, and to grant any such party any
extensions of time for payment of the Subsequent Securities Payment, or to
grant any other indulgences or forbearances whatsoever, without notice to any
other party and without in any way affecting the personal liability of any
Party hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Following the Closing and prior to the Subsequent Securities Payment being
paid in full by Buyer, if Buyer or ENLK becomes subject to any bankruptcy or
other insolvency proceeding, then in any such case the Subsequent Securities
Payment shall automatically become due and payable, without any notice or any
other action by Seller, the next Business Day immediately succeeding the
occurrence of such event.

 



 

(h) Buyer and ENLK acknowledge that the Subsequent Securities Payment was a
necessary component of the consideration to induce Seller and the Members to
enter into this Agreement, and that Seller and the Members would not have
entered into this Agreement to sell the Securities unless Buyer had agreed to
be irrevocably obligated to pay the Subsequent Securities Payment as provided
in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Tall Oak Marks_. Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest,
license or any other right whatsoever to use the words "Tall Oak" or "Tall Oak
Midstream" or any trademarks containing or comprising the foregoing
(collectively, the " ** _Tall Oak Marks_** "). From and after the Closing,
Buyer agrees that it shall (a) cease using the Tall Oak Marks in any manner,
directly or indirectly, except for such limited uses as cannot be promptly
terminated ( _e.g._ , signage), and to cease such limited usage of the Tall
Oak Marks as promptly as possible after the Closing and in any event within 6
months following the Closing Date, and (b) remove, strike over or otherwise
obliterate all Tall Oak Marks from all assets and all other materials owned,
possessed or used by Buyer. The Parties agree, because damages would be an
inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to enforce this _Section 6.20_ shall
be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for
any breach thereof in addition to other remedies available at law or in
equity. This covenant shall survive indefinitely without limitation as to
time. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, nothing in
this paragraph shall restrict Buyers or its Affiliates rights to, ownership
of or use of the name "EnLink TOM Holdings, LP", "TOMPC LLC", "TOM-STACK, LLC"
and "TOM-STACK Crude, LLC".

 



 

Section 6.21 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement, subject to the other terms of this Agreement and without limiting
the provisions of _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.12_, each party hereto will
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all action and to do all things
necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate the Transactions as soon
as possible, including the satisfaction of the conditions precedent in
_Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_.

(a) Section 6.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists certain
agreements to which Tall Oak is a party but which are used in business of the
Company or the Company Systems (the " ** _Specified Tall Oak Agreements_** ").
Tall Oak shall effect an assignment of each Specified Tall Oak Agreement to
the Company, Buyer or its designee, as requested by Buyer, prior to Closing;
_provided_ , that each such assignment shall (i) be valid

 



      
 

 



 

under, and in compliance with, the terms of the applicable Specified Tall Oak
Agreement, (ii) not result in the termination of, or give rise to any express
rights or remedies of any third party to terminate, modify or receive any

that may arise in connection with, result from, or otherwise be triggered by
the Transactions, including a change of control of the Company and TS Crude
(each, a " ** _Specified Tall Oak Agreement Assignment_** ").

 



 

(b) Section 6.23(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists certain
agreements to which Tall Oak is a party but which are used in the business of
the Company or the Company Systems (the " ** _Section 6.23(b) Contracts_**").
Tall Oak shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an assignment of
each Section 6.23(b) Contract to the Company, Buyer or its designee, as
requested by Buyer, prior to Closing, in each case that shall (i) be valid
under, and in compliance with, the terms of the applicable Section 6.23(b)
Contract, (ii) not result in the termination of, or give rise to any express
rights or remedies of any third party to terminate, modify or receive any

rights of any third parties party to such Section 6.23(b) Contract that may
arise in connection with, result from, or otherwise be triggered by the
Transactions, including a change of control of the Company and TS Crude;
_provided_ , that if any Section 6.23(b) Contracts have not been assigned to
Buyer or its designee at or prior to Closing, then Tall Oak shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the assignment of the Section
6.23(b) Contracts in a manner that complies with clause (i) through (iii) of
this _Section 6.23(b)_ to Buyer or its designee promptly following Closing,
and, in any event, Tall Oak shall be required to complete such assignment of
all Section 6.23(b) Contracts to Buyer or its designee as provided herein no
later than sixty days following the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.24 _Transaction Unit Lockup_. Each of Seller, Tall Oak and FE-STACK
agrees that, without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of Seller, Tall
Oak or FE-STACK shall, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending 30 days after the Closing Date (the " ** _Lockup Period_** "), (a)
offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option right or warrant to
purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly,
any of the Transaction Units or (b) enter into any swap or other transaction
or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that might reasonably
be expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole or in part, of any
of the economic consequences of ownership of the Transaction Units, whether
any such transaction described in clause (a) or clause (b) above (a " **
_Transfer_** ") is to be settled by delivery of ENLC Units, other securities,
in cash or otherwise. Each of Seller, Tall Oak and FE-STACK acknowledges that
an appropriate legend may be placed on the Transaction Units or applicable
stop transfer instructions may be placed with ENLCs transfer agent so as to
restrict any such Transfer during the Lockup Period. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.24_, Seller may distribute the
Transaction Units to the Members as provided in _Section 2.3(d)(ii)_.

 



 

Section 6.25 _Listing of Units_. Prior to the Closing, ENLC will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval for listing, subject to
notice of issuance, of the Transaction Units on the NYSE.

under this Agreement (which, in the case of a termination by (i) Sellers

Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses shall not exceed:

 



 

(i) with respect to the matters contained in _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section

$133,864,000.00; and

 



 

(ii) with respect to the matters contained in _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _Section

(B) with respect to any Loss arising out of (1) Seller Taxes, (2) any breach
of (x) any representation or warranty in _Section 3.1(g)_ and _Section 4.14_
or (y) any of the Fundamental Representations or (3) _Section 9.2(a)(v)_, a
Members aggregate liability to Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
9.2_ for such Losses shall not be subject to the preceding limitations of this
_Section 9.4(c)_, but shall not exceed such Members percentage share of the
Base Purchase Price (as such percentage shares are set forth in _Schedule
B_); _provided_ , that, in the case of clause (2)(y) (as applicable for
_Section 9.2(b)(iv)_ and _Section 9.2(c)(ii)_), the Member whose breach gave

Indemnified Parties for all such Losses arising as a result of such breach and
to the extent, and only to the extent, such Losses exceed such Members
percentage share of the Base Purchase Price (as such percentage shares are set
forth in _Schedule B_ ) or are not satisfied by such Member in accordance with
this Agreement the other Member shall be liable for the remaining amount of
such Losses;

 



 

(C) if a claim for indemnification may be brought under more than one
subsection of _Section 9.2_, such claim may be brought by a Buyer Indemnified
Party under any or all of such subsections subject to the limitation on
recovery that is applicable to each such subsection (for the avoidance of
doubt, if a claim may be brought under more than one

 



      
 

 



 

subsection of _Section 9.2_ and claims brought under such subsections are
subject to different limitations on recovery pursuant to this _Section 9.4_,
a Buyer Indemnified Party may bring such claim under the subsection of
_Section 9.2_ with the most favorable terms for recovery available to such
Buyer Indemnified Party, and such Buyer Indemnified Partys recovery shall not
be limited by virtue of the fact that such claim could have been brought by
such Buyer Indemnified Party under another subsection of _Section 9.2_ under
which recovery would have been further limited); and

 



 

(D) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event will a Members liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
_Section 9.2_ exceed such Members percentage share of the proceeds received
by Seller in accordance with this Agreement as such percentage shares are set
forth in _Schedule B_.

 



 

(E) for purposes of determining the amount of the proceeds received by Seller
in accordance with this Agreement, proceeds shall include the amount of all
cash delivered by Buyer to Seller (or the Escrow Agent), _plus_ an amount
equal to the number of Transaction Units delivered pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_ multiplied by the ENLC Unit Price.

 



 

(d) In no event shall (i) ENLCs aggregate liability to the Seller Indemnified
Parties under _Section 9.3(b)_ exceed an amount equal to the number of
Transaction Units delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ multiplied by the
ENLC Unit Price or (ii) Buyer have any liability to or obligation to indemnify
any Seller Indemnified Party for Losses relating to any matters contained in
_Section 9.3(b)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall a party from whom indemnification is sought (an " ** _Indemnifying
Party_** ") be liable under this _ARTICLE IX_ for (i) any exemplary or
punitive damages or (ii) any special, consequential, incidental or indirect
damages or lost profits, except (x) in the case of clause (ii), to the extent
any such damages or lost profits would otherwise be recoverable under
applicable Law in an action for breach of contract or (y) in the case of
clause (i) or clause (ii), any such damages or lost profits that are included
in any Third-Party Claim against an Indemnified Party for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to Losses resulting from Taxes, each Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses upon and
after obtaining Knowledge of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. In the
event an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such Loss that
reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnified Party made such
efforts. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after an
Indemnified Party acquires Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that results
in or reasonably would be expected to result in an indemnified Loss or a
Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party may have Liability to such
Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
promptly and implement, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense,
such reasonable actions as the Indemnifying Party shall request in writing for
the purposes of mitigating the possible Losses arising therefrom.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) For purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_, except in connection with an
indemnification claim brought pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, in determining
whether there exists a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
to _ARTICLE VII_, and in calculating Losses hereunder, any and all
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, _de minimis_ , or similar qualifications
in the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements shall be
disregarded.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 6.10(d)_:

 



 

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have liability (except with respect to any Seller Tax Contest or
other liability with respect to Taxes) to any Indemnified Party hereunder is
asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party (a " ** _Third-Party Claim_** ") such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify Buyer (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified
Party), the Sellers Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer
Indemnified Party and the Third-Party Claim relates to an indemnity obligation
for which the Members would be severally liable pursuant to _Section 9.2_) or
the Member that may have liability pursuant to such Third-Party Claim (if the
Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party and the Third-Party Claim
relates to an indemnity obligation for which a Member would be solely liable
pursuant to _Section 9.2_) in writing of such Third-Party Claim, the amount
or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a " ** _Claim Notice_** "). However, the
failure to give prompt notice will not affect the rights or obligations of the
Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced. The Indemnifying Party shall
have 15 days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as
may be required by court proceedings in the event of a litigated matter) after
receipt of the Claim Notice (the " ** _Notice Period_** ") to notify the
Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense; _provided_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the
Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to indemnify such Indemnified
Party as provided hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that any counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. Once the Indemnifying
Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such
defense and to employ a single separate counsel of its choosing, which counsel
must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party
shall participate in any such defense at its expense unless the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of
outside counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel would
be

 



      
 

 



 

inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall participate in such defense and employ
separate counsel, which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
unless such settlement, compromise or offer includes an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Party and would not materially and adversely affect
the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, does not give the Indemnified Party timely notice
of its desire to so defend against such Third-Party Claim or fails to
diligently defend such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to assume its own defense; _it being
understood_ that the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third-
Party Claim, including indemnification for all costs and expenses associated
with the Indemnified Party assuming its own defense, shall not be adversely
affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall not settle a Third-Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.5_ to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend any Third-Party Claim (but
may participate, at its own cost, in the defense of such claim) if such claim
(i) seeks an injunction or other equitable remedies in respect of the
Indemnified Party or its business, (ii) involves a plaintiff that is a
material customer of the Company or that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material adverse impact on the Indemnified Partys relationship
with one or more of such material customers, (iii) is a criminal claim or (iv)
has a reasonable risk of resulting in a Loss that would exceed the monetary
limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(c)_, in which case the Indemnified
Party may elect to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim and such
reasonable expenses shall constitute Losses payable to the Indemnified Party
as set forth in this _ARTICLE IX_.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees.

 



 

(f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client, work-product, common interest or
joint defense privileges. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
9.5_ shall be construed as a waiver by an Indemnified Party or an Indemnifying
Party of any privilege, including any privilege associated with separate
counsel as described herein.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Escrow Account_. To secure and to serve as a fund in respect of
indemnification obligations owed to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _ARTICLE IX_,

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount in accordance with
_Section 2.3(e)(ii)_, if applicable. If the Escrow Amount is deposited with
the Escrow Agent, then on the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " ** _Escrow Release Date_** "), Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Direction directing the Escrow Agent to
release to Seller the excess of (x) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account
at such time (including any accumulated interest thereon) _over_ (y) the
amount of claims for indemnification under this _ARTICLE IX_ asserted by any
Buyer Indemnified Parties on or prior to the Escrow Release Date but not yet
resolved (" ** _Escrow Unresolved Claims_** "). Buyer and Seller shall
promptly, and in any event within three Business Days following any final
determination with respect to an Escrow Unresolved Claim, execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a Joint Direction directing the Escrow Agent to distribute
to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, the amounts set forth in such Joint
Direction (as determined in accordance with the final determination related
thereto).

 



 

Section 9.7 _Payments_.

 



 

(a) At any time following the Closing, but prior to the payment of the First
Subsequent Securities Payment, upon any final determination of a Loss and the
Members liability therefor, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
9.1_ and _Section 9.4_, (i) the amount of such Loss shall constitute an
Interim Indemnity Obligation and shall be retained by Buyer as a reduction to
the First Subsequent Securities Payment, and (ii) to the extent such Loss
exceeds the First Subsequent Securities Payment, then the Members shall pay to
Buyer an amount, if any, equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than 15 days following any final determination of
such Loss and the Members liability therefor.

 



 

(b) At any time following the payment of the First Subsequent Securities
Payment, but prior to the distribution of all amounts remaining in the Escrow
Account, upon any final determination of a Loss and the Members liability
therefor, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section
9.4_, (i) Buyer and Seller shall promptly, and in any event within three
Business Days following any final determination of such Loss, execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Direction directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Buyer from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) any such Losses and (y) the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, and
(ii) the Members shall pay to Buyer an amount, if any, equal to the amount by
which such Losses exceeded the amount released from the Escrow Account
pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section 9.7(b)_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds no later than 15 days following any final
determination of such Loss and the Members liability therefor.

 



 

(c) At any time following the date on which all amounts remaining in the
Escrow Account have been distributed (or, if no amounts were deposited into
the Escrow Account in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)(ii)_, the delivery of
the First Subsequent Securities Payment), upon any final determination of a
Loss and the Members liability therefor, subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.4_, the Members shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the amount of such Loss by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than 15 days following any final determination of such Loss and
the Members liability therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Upon any final determination of a Loss and Buyers liability therefor,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.4_,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such Loss by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than 15 days following any
final determination of such Loss and Buyers liability therefor.

 



 

(e) Upon any final determination of a Loss and ENLCs liability therefor,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.4_,
ENLC shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such Loss by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than 15 days following any
final determination of such Loss and ENLCs liability therefor.

 



 

(f) A "final determination" shall exist with respect to all or a portion of a
claimed Loss when, following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill,
together with all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for
a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, (i) the Indemnifying
Party does not in good faith dispute all or such portion of such Loss by
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 10 Business Days of its receipt
of such bill, (ii) the parties have reached an agreement in writing with
respect thereto, (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a
final and non-appealable order or judgment with respect thereto or (iv) an
arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable
determination with respect to the disputes the parties to such dispute have
agreed to submit thereto.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made
by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 



 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person, net of any actual Taxes, costs or expenses incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted. In the
event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party with
respect to any occurrence, claim or Loss that results in a payment by an
Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE IX_, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that until the Indemnified Party recovers full payment of the
Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third
party on account of said indemnity payment are hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Indemnified Partys rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein, and
otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. In calculating the amount of any Loss for
which Buyer is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the amount of any
reserve or other

 



       
 

 



 

negative provision related to such Loss shall be deducted to the extent
reflected in the Final Balance Sheet and taken into account for any adjustment
to the Base Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.3_ and _Section
2.4_.

 



 

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the amount, if any, by which (i) the sum of (A) the
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Loss _plus_ (B) the amount received from the third party in respect
thereof, exceeds (ii) the full amount of such Loss.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Remedies; Exclusive Remedy_. Except (a) in the case of fraud or
willful breach of this Agreement by the Party against whom rights and remedies
are sought to be enforced, (b) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and (c) as otherwise provided in _Section
6.19_ and _Section 10.8_, from and after Closing the rights and remedies
under this _ARTICLE IX_ are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights
and remedies that the Seller Indemnified Parties may have against Buyer or
that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may have against the Members or Seller
under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the Company, the Securities
or any breach of any representation or warranty or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, each of the Parties expressly waives any and all other rights,
remedies and causes of action (other than under this _ARTICLE IX_ and any
exceptions thereto listed in the first sentence of this _Section 9.10_) it or
its Affiliates may have, in the case of the Members or Seller, against Buyer
and, in the case of Buyer, against the Members, Seller and their respective
Affiliates, now or in the future under any Law with respect to the
Transactions. From and after Closing, the remedies expressly provided in this
Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for and means of
recourse between the Members and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, with respect to the Transactions.

confirmation of receipt), (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a
nationally recognized overnight courier (return receipt requested), (c) on the
date sent by e-mail or facsimile (with confirmation of transmission,
including, in the case of e-mail, an automated confirmation of receipt) if

after the date mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt

10.1_) set forth on _Schedule A_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing,
expressly states that it is intended to amend this Agreement or waive a right
under this Agreement and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Person
signatory hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the Person against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Person in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Law except as otherwise specifically
provided in _ARTICLE IX_ hereof.

 



 

Section 10.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Buyer, Seller, Members and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. None of
Buyer, Seller, Members or the Company may assign any of their respective
rights or delegate any of their respective obligations under this Agreement
(for the avoidance of doubt, no merger or sale of securities of Buyer or
Seller or any entity that directly or indirectly controls any of Buyer or
Seller shall constitute an assignment hereunder), without the prior written
consent of the others, except as provided in _Section 10.5_, and any
attempted or purported assignment in violation of this _Section 10.3_ shall
be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , Buyer may assign all or any portion
of this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer (or any debt financing source for
collateral purposes) without the consent of any Party hereto, _provided_ that
such assignment shall not relieve Buyer from its obligations hereunder. From
and after the Closing, each Person that is an Indemnified Party but not a
party to this Agreement shall be an express third-party beneficiary of
_Section 6.7_, _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_, and Parent shall be an
express third-party beneficiary of _Section 6.18_. Except as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits), the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Person
signatory hereto to any other Person signatory hereto under this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents that is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Person signatory hereto shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Person signatory
hereto. Each party to each of the Transaction Documents shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to perform all actions, agreements and obligations
set forth herein or therein requiring the performance of any such Subsidiary
or Affiliate (including any entity that becomes a Subsidiary or Affiliate of
such party on or after the date hereof).

 



 

Section 10.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be borne by the Person signatory hereto incurring such costs and expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum;
Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) All actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the
Transactions shall be heard and determined exclusively in Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, Seller, Buyer, the Members and the
Company hereby (i) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chancery Courts and federal courts in Delaware (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) for the purpose of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the other Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the Transactions brought by any of them, (ii)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action,
suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that any of the above named courts
lack jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement, any of the other Transaction
Documents or the Transactions and (iii) irrevocably consent to and grant any
such court exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding
in the manner provided in _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(c) SELLER, THE MEMBERS, THE COMPANY AND BUYER EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS.
SELLER, THE MEMBERS, THE COMPANY AND BUYER EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 10.7(c)_.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that its
obligations hereunder are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary
damages, will be inadequate in the event it should default in the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any
breach of any agreement, representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer, in the case of a breach by Seller, either Member or the
Company, and Seller, each Member and the Company in the case of a breach by
Buyer, shall be entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual
damages, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for
specific performance to prevent breaches of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and to order the defaulting Party to affirmatively carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, and each of the Parties hereby waives any
defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for
such breach. Such equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which each of the Parties are entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for
such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. Each of the Parties hereby
waives any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such
equitable remedy. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be or construed as a
waiver or election of remedies by any of the Parties, each of whom expressly
reserves any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity
in the event of any breach or default by the others under this Agreement prior
to the Closing.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. Except with respect to any Supplemental
Disclosure, which is governed by _Section 6.5_, the disclosure of any matter
in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " ** _Disclosure Schedules_** "), as
applicable, shall be deemed to be a disclosure under each other section or
subsection of the respective Persons Disclosure Schedule to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of any
item in any section or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules, as an
exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise shall not be deemed
to constitute an admission by any of the Parties, as applicable, or to
otherwise imply, that any such item has had or is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer Material
Adverse Effect, ENLC Material Adverse Effect or otherwise represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purposes of this
Agreement, that such item meets or exceeds a monetary or other threshold
specified for disclosure in this Agreement or that such item represents a
determination that the Transactions require the consent of any third party.
The sections or subsections of each Disclosure Schedule are arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections
of this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section or subsection of any of
the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters that are
required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or obligation to disclose
any information beyond what is required by this Agreement, and disclosure of
such additional matters shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the
interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the disclosure obligations
hereunder. To the extent cross-references are set forth in any section or
subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such cross-references are
intended solely for convenience and are by no means intended as a statement of
limitation as to where disclosure is relevant or appropriate, and any
information set forth in one section or subsection of such Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof or hereof
to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The
reference to any Contract or other documents or materials in any section or
subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to reference all
terms and conditions of, and schedules and annexes to, such Contract or other
document to the extent made available, prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Buyer and its Representatives or Seller, the Members, the Company and their
respective Representatives, as applicable. Headings inserted in the sections
or subsections of any of the Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of
reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or changing
the express terms of the Sections or subsections as set forth in this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy
of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Sellers Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers Representative is hereby appointed by each Member (and its
successors and assigns) as agent and attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution for such party, for and on behalf of such party, as the party
authorized to: (i) negotiate, defend, dispute, contest, assert, compromise and
settle all post-Closing claims and matters arising under this Agreement,
including any dispute or final resolution of Final Closing Items under
_Section 2.4_ and post-Closing claims and matters relating to any claim for
indemnification under _ARTICLE IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to any claim or demand for indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_
for which FE-STACK may have liability (except with respect to any Seller Tax
Contest) to a Buyer Indemnified Party, if such claim or demand relates to an
indemnity obligation for which FE-STACK would be solely liable pursuant to
_Section 9.2_, FE-STACK, not the Sellers Representative, shall have full
authority to negotiate, defend, dispute, contest, assert, compromise and
settle such claims and demands, (ii) agree to, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims and matters, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Sellers
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, (iii) initiate or
refrain from initiating or dispute or refrain from disputing any claim for
indemnification or other claim under this Agreement, (iv) take any other
action expressly delegated to the Sellers Representative under the other terms
of this Agreement and (v) give and receive notices and communications to or
from Seller relating to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, in each case without having to seek
or obtain the consent of the Members. Sellers Representative shall keep each
of the Members reasonably informed in connection with any action or decision
delegated to Sellers Representative by this Agreement, including this _Section
10.13_, and shall promptly provide each Member with all documentation or
communication involved therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment. The Members shall indemnify the Sellers
Representative and hold the Sellers Representative harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Sellers
Representatives duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative. This
right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Any
Person, including Buyer, dealing with the Sellers Representative is entitled
to rely on the actions taken by, and consents and approvals given by, the
Sellers Representative as the actions of each Member without the need for
further investigation. A Person, including Buyer, shall be entitled to rely on
the Sellers Representatives actions, consents and approvals notwithstanding
any knowledge of the relying Person. No Person shall have any liability for
relying on the Sellers Representative in the foregoing manner.

 



 

(c) If the Sellers Representative becomes unable or unwilling to serve as an
agent, such other Person or Persons as may be designated by the Members shall
succeed such Person as the Sellers Representative. If the Sellers
Representative should at any time become unwilling to serve as the Sellers
Representative, he promptly shall so notify Seller in writing, and shall bear
no liability of any kind or nature whatsoever as a consequence of such
determination. In addition, at any time as determined in the sole discretion
of the Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative may decline to take
any action, make any determination, or otherwise bear any expense without
having first obtained the approval or consent of Seller or any Member.

 



 

Section 10.14 _Role of Paul Hastings LLP; Waiver of Conflicts and Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, managers, partners, officers, employees
and Affiliates that, for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Paul Hastings LLP has acted as lead counsel on behalf of
Seller, the Members and the Company. After the Closing, it is possible that
Paul Hastings LLP will represent Seller, the Company, Members or their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " ** _Seller
Group_** ") in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. Buyer,
Seller and the Members hereby agree that Paul Hastings LLP (or any successor)
may represent all or a portion the Seller Group or any director, member,
manager, partner, officer, employee, representative or Affiliate of the Seller
Group (any such Person, a " ** _Designated Person_** ") in the future in
connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement, including in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " **
_Post-Closing Representation_** "). Each of the Parties hereto consents to the
Post-Closing Representation, and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each such Party will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to
waive any conflict of interest arising from such Post-Closing Representation.
Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that such consent and waiver is
voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the Parties have
consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In connection with any Post-Closing Representation in connection with a
dispute with Buyer and, following the Closing, with the Company, Buyer waives
and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to waive and to not
assert, as applicable, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between Paul Hastings LLP and any Designated Person regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and occurring during the
period of time up to and through the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, or to communications with any Person other than the
Designated Persons and their advisors.

 ** _ESCROW AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This ESCROW AGREEMENT is made as of [*], 2015 (this " ** _Agreement_** ") by
and among EnLink TOM Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" **
_Buyer_** "), TOM-STACK Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
** _Seller_** "), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national
banking association, as escrow agent (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** "). Buyer,
Seller and the Escrow Agent are each referred to herein as a " ** _Party_** "
and collectively as the " ** _Parties_**."

 



 

 ** _W I T N E S S E T H:_**

 



 

A. Buyer and Seller are parties to that certain TOM-STACK Securities Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2015 (as the same may be amended from time
to time in accordance with the provisions thereof, the " ** _Purchase
Agreement_** "), by and among TOM-STACK, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " ** _Company_** "), Tall Oak Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, FE-STACK, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
Seller, Buyer, EnLink Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
and, solely for the limited purposes set forth in Section 6.19 therein, EnLink

among other things, Buyer will purchase all, but not less than all, of the
membership interests of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Purchase Agreement;

 



 

B. To secure and to serve as a fund in respect of indemnification obligations
owed to any of Buyer, its affiliates (including the Company) and their
respective directors, managers, officers, partners, members, shareholders,
trustees and employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each
in their capacity as such, pursuant to Article IX of the Purchase Agreement,
the Purchase Agreement provides that on the Deposit Date (as defined below),
Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to $133,864,000 (such amount, as may be
adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, that is actually
deposited with the Escrow Agent, the " ** _Escrow Amount_** ") in immediately
available funds confirmed by wire transfer into an account with the Escrow
Agent (the " ** _Escrow Account_** " and, the Escrow Amount, together with any
and all interest and other earnings thereon while held in the Escrow Account,
the " ** _Escrow Funds_** "). The " ** _Deposit Date_** " means the day that
Buyer pays the Subsequent Securities Payment (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) to Seller and delivers to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount;
_provided_ , if Buyer has not delivered to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount
within one Business Day after the twelve month anniversary of the date hereof,
then the Deposit Date shall not occur and this Agreement shall terminate in
accordance with _Section 23_;

 



 

C. Buyer and Seller desire that the Escrow Agent act as escrow agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent is willing
to act in such capacity; and

 



 

D. Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not a party
to, is not bound by, and has no duties or obligations under, the Purchase
Agreement, that all references in this Agreement to the Purchase Agreement are
for convenience, and that the Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties beyond
the express duties set forth in this Agreement.

      
 

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises and of the respective
agreements and covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Escrow Agent Appointment_. Buyer and Seller hereby appoint and designate the Escrow Agent as escrow agent to receive the Escrow Funds and to hold and distribute the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

 



 

2. _Establishment of Escrow_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement from and after the deposit, if any, by Buyer with Escrow Agent of the Escrow Amount (which deposit will be made in accordance with the writing instructions as set forth in _Exhibit B-2_ attached hereto or any other instructions as may be provided in writing by the Escrow Agent to Buyer in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10_ hereof prior to the Deposit Date). In the event the Deposit Date occurs within the twelve month anniversary of the date hereof, the Buyer shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing of the Deposit Date and Escrow Amount prior to the delivery of the Escrow Amount.

 



 

3. _Investment of Funds; Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in a Wells Fargo Money
Market Deposit Account as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto, or otherwise
invest the Escrow Funds as set forth in any subsequent written instruction
signed by Buyer and Seller. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for failure
to invest or reinvest funds absent such authorization and written direction.
It is expressly agreed and understood by the Buyer and Seller that the Escrow
Agent is not providing investment advice or recommendations and that the
Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be liable for losses on any
investments, including, but not limited to, losses from market risks due to
premature liquidation or resulting from other actions taken pursuant to any
written instruction signed by Buyer and Seller. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to sell or redeem any such investments as necessary to make any
payments or distributions required under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) For certain payments made pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may
be required to make a "reportable payment" or "withholdable payment" and in
such cases the Escrow Agent shall have the duty to act as a payor or
withholding agent, respectively, that is responsible for any tax withholding
and reporting required under Chapters 3, 4, and 61 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_** "). The Escrow
Agent shall have the sole right to make the determination as to which payments
are "reportable payments" or

      
 

 



 

"withholdable payments." The Buyer and Seller shall provide an executed IRS
Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or, in each case, any successor form) to
the Escrow Agent prior to closing, and shall promptly update any such form to
the extent such form becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect.
Additionally, the Buyer and Seller shall provide the certified tax
identification number of the administrator by furnishing appropriate forms W-9
or W-8 for the administrator and shall promptly update any such form to the
extent such form becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect. The Escrow
Agent shall have the right to request from the Buyer and Seller, or any other
person entitled to payment hereunder, any additional forms, documentation or
other information as may be reasonably necessary for the Escrow Agent to
satisfy its reporting and withholding obligations under the Code. To the
extent any such forms to be delivered under this _Section 3(b)_ are not
provided or are determined by the Escrow Agent to be incomplete and/or
inaccurate in any respect prior to or by the time the related payment is
required to be made, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to withhold on any
such payments hereunder to the extent withholding is required under Chapters
3, 4, or 61 of the Code, and shall have no obligation to gross up any such
payment.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall deliver to Buyer and Seller promptly following the
conclusion of each month following the Deposit Date a written statement of
account with respect to the investment of the Escrow Funds and any interest or
other earnings received on the Escrow Funds. Receipt, investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by the Escrow Agent as
soon as reasonably practicable by account statement.

 



 

(d) All interest or other earnings from investment of the Escrow Funds shall,
as of the end of each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal
Revenue Service, be reported as having been earned by Seller, whether or not
income was disbursed during a particular year.

 



 

(e) If the Escrow Agent receives appropriate instructions hereunder to sell
any investments of any Escrow Funds, the proceeds of the sale of such
investments will be delivered on the Business Day (as defined below) on which
such instructions are received by the Escrow Agent if received prior to the
deadline for same day sale of such investments. If such instructions are
received after the applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next
succeeding Business Day.

 



 

4. _Disbursements of Escrow Funds and Accretions Thereto_.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Funds in safekeeping and disburse
the same or any part thereof only in accordance with and upon: (i) jointly
executed written instructions in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B-1_ of
Buyer and Seller (a " ** _Joint Direction_**"), signed by both Buyer and
Seller (or counterparts thereof), or (ii) a written instruction,

      
 

 



 

order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (x) which has not been
reversed, stayed, modified, amended, enjoined, set aside, annulled or
suspended, (y) with respect to which no request for a stay, motion or
application for reconsideration or rehearing, notice of appeal or petition for
certiorari is filed within the deadline provided by applicable statute or
regulation or as to which any appeal that has been taken or any petition for
certiorari that has been or may be filed has been resolved by the highest
court to which the order or judgment was appealed or from which certiorari was
sought and (z) as to which the deadlines for filing such request, motion,
petition, application, appeal or notice referred to in clause (y) above have
expired (a " ** _Court Direction_** "). The Escrow Agent shall receive and may
conclusively rely upon a written opinion of counsel to Buyer or Seller to the
effect that a written instruction, order or judgment is a Court Direction as
defined in this _Section 4(a)_, provided that (x) such opinion states that
the opinion and Court Direction were previously or simultaneously provided to
each other Party and (y) no objection thereto is delivered to the Escrow Agent
by any other Party during the five Business Days following the date that such
opinion was delivered to the Escrow Agent. In addition to the foregoing, if
any interest or other income is earned from investment of the Escrow Funds,
then within five (5) Business Days after the end of each calendar quarter in
which such interest or other income is earned, and in addition, on a day prior
to or concurrently with the final disbursement of the Escrow Funds in
accordance with this _Section 4_, Escrow Agent will disburse to Seller an
amount equal to 40% of the amount of such interest or other income earned on
the Escrow Funds, in each case since the end of the prior calendar quarter as
coverage for the estimated tax liability of Seller.

 



 

(b) Not later than two (2) Business Days after receipt of a Joint Direction or
seven (7) Business Days after receipt of a Court Direction, in either case,
directing the Escrow Agent to disburse monies from the Escrow Funds contained
in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and provisions of such
Joint Direction or Court Direction, the Escrow Agent shall disburse such
Escrow Funds in accordance therewith.

 



 

(c) Any Joint Direction or Court Direction may instruct the Escrow Agent to
release all or any portion of the remainder of the Escrow Funds contained in
the Escrow Account.

 



 

(d) Buyer or Seller may hereafter act through an agent or attorney in fact
only if written evidence of authority in form and substance satisfactory to
the Escrow Agent is furnished to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(e) All disbursements to Buyer or Seller of all or any portion of the Escrow
Funds shall be made in accordance with the wiring instructions provided to the
Escrow Agent by Buyer or Seller as set forth in _Exhibit B-2_ attached hereto
or any other instructions as may be provided in a Joint Direction.

      
 

 



 

The wiring instructions for any Party set forth in _Exhibit B-2_ may be
revised by such Party by delivering written notice to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 10_ hereof. The Escrow Agent
agrees that upon receipt of a Joint Direction or Court Direction instructing
the Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Funds, the Escrow
Agent shall comply therewith and wire such funds pursuant to the wiring
instructions provided by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, as contained in
_Exhibit B-2_ or otherwise in accordance with this _Section 4(e)_. If the
Party to whom such funds are to be paid has not provided the Escrow Agent with
wiring instructions, then the Escrow Agent shall disburse the funds in
compliance with the terms of such Joint Direction or Court Direction along
with detailed payment instructions from the Party to whom Escrow Funds will be
released.

 



 

(f) The Escrow Account shall be deemed dissolved upon the disbursement by the
Escrow Agent of the entire amount of the Escrow Funds in accordance with this
Agreement.

 



 

5. _Duties of the Escrow Agent_.

 



 

(a) _Accounts and Records_. The Escrow Agent shall keep accurate books and
records of all transactions hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Standard of Care_. The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only to perform
the duties specifically set forth in this Agreement, which shall be deemed
purely ministerial in nature, and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be
a fiduciary to any Party or any other person. Buyer and Seller agree that the
Escrow Agent shall not assume any responsibility for the failure of Buyer or
Seller to perform in accordance with this Agreement. This Agreement sets forth
all matters pertinent to the Escrow Account contemplated hereunder, and no
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred from the terms of
this Agreement or any other agreement. **IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ESCROW AGENT BE
LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY** (i) damages, losses or expenses
arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or
expenses which have been finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) **SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION**.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted under
this Agreement so long as it shall have acted without gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

      
 

 



 

(c) _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon and shall be
protected in acting upon any request, instructions, statement or other
instrument delivered by Buyer or Seller pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement, not only as to its due execution, validity and effectiveness, but
also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which
the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been
signed or presented by the person purporting to sign the same and to conform
to the provisions of this Agreement. Concurrent with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller, respectively, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
an authorized signers form in the form of _Exhibit C-1_ and _Exhibit C-2_
which contain authorized signer designations in Part I thereof.

 



 

(d) _Attorneys and Agents_. The Escrow Agent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to consult with counsel or other such professionals of choice and
shall not be liable for action taken or omitted to be taken by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel or other such
professionals. The Escrow Agent may in all cases pay reasonable compensation
to such counsel and shall be entitled to reimbursement for all reasonable,
documented compensation paid. The Escrow Agent may perform its duties through
its agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees. The Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceeding in connection
with the Escrow Funds, any account in which the Escrow Funds are deposited or
this Agreement, or to prosecute or defend any such legal action or
proceedings.

 



 

(e) _No Financial Obligation_. No provision of this Agreement shall require
the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the performance of its duties or the exercise of its
rights under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Force Majeure_. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable for
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances
beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God;
earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of terrorism; civil or military
disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions
of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications services;
accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or governmental
action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances.

      
 

 



 

6. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and at all times after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller,
jointly and severally, agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law and to
the extent provided in _Section 6(b)_, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Escrow Agent and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Escrow
Agent (collectively, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** "), against any and all
actions, claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, costs,
penalties, fines, judgments and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses)
incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after
the date hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or
arising from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or
proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by any person, whether
threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy
against any person under any statute or regulation, including without
limitation, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or
equitable cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any
such Indemnified Party is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the
target of any such inquiry or investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any
liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to
no further appeal, to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. The obligations of Buyer and
Seller under this _Section 6_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that the payment by Buyer or Seller of any claim by the
Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder shall not impair, limit, modify or
affect, as between Buyer and Seller, the respective rights and obligations of
Buyer and Seller under this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement. The Parties
further agree that any obligation for indemnification under this _Section 6_
shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in proportion to Buyers and Sellers
respective responsibility, if any, of such loss, damage, liability, cost or
expense for which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification, the
causation to be determined by mutual agreement, arbitration (if both Buyer and
Seller agree in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration) or litigation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if no such Party is determined to be responsible
for such loss, damage, liability, cost or expense, any obligation for
indemnification under this _Section 6_ shall be borne equally between Buyer
and Seller.

 



 

7. _Disputes_. If, at any time, the Escrow Agent shall have received written notification by Buyer or Seller of any unresolved dispute between or amongst the Buyer and

      
 

 



 

Seller with respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of the Escrow
Funds or any other obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder, or if at any
time the Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to the Escrow Agents sole
satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion of the Escrow Funds or the
Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its obligations hereunder, or if
Buyer and Seller have not, within thirty (30) Business Days after the
furnishing by the Escrow Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to _Section
8_ below, appointed a successor escrow agent to act hereunder, then the Escrow
Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following
actions:

 



 

(a) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
(other than the safekeeping and investment of the Escrow Funds) until such
dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of the
Escrow Agent or until a successor escrow agent shall have been appointed (as
the case may be) as evidenced by written instructions executed by Buyer and
Seller; or

 



 

(b) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction for instructions with respect to
such dispute or uncertainty, and pay into or deposit with such court all
disputed escrow amounts held by it pursuant to this Agreement for holding and
disposition in accordance with the instructions of such court.

 



 

Subject to _Section 5(b)_, the Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Buyer
or Seller or any other person with respect to any action taken pursuant to
this _Section 7_, specifically including any liability that may arise, or be
alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the disbursement
of funds held in the Escrow Account or any delay in or with respect to any
other action required or requested of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

8. _Resignation or Removal of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may resign from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer and Seller. In addition, Buyer and Seller may jointly remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time, with or without cause, by an instrument jointly executed by Buyer and Seller, along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it is entitled through the date of removal, and given to the Escrow Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal. Upon any such notice of resignation or removal, Buyer and Seller, acting jointly, shall appoint a successor escrow agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller. If Buyer and Seller do not agree upon a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) Business Days after their receipt of the Escrow Agents resignation notice, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto. Any successor escrow agent shall deliver to Buyer and Seller a written instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder and shall be entitled to receive possession of the Escrow Funds. Upon receipt of the identity of the successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Funds then held hereunder to the successor escrow agent. In the event of the resignation or removal of the

      
 

 



 

Escrow Agent, the resigning or removed escrow agent shall be absolved from any
further duties as the Escrow Agent hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Escrow Agent or any successor escrow agent shall continue to act as the
Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the Escrow
Agent.

 



 

9. _Fees_. Buyer shall compensate the Escrow Agent for its services hereunder in accordance with _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (collectively, the " ** _Fees_** "). The Fees agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder are intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agents services as contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Agreement are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of this Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event. If any amount due to the Escrow Agent hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) days of the date due, the Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on such amount up to the highest rate permitted by applicable law. All Fees shall be paid upon demand by the Escrow Agent. The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 9_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Account with respect to its unpaid Fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid Fees non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow Funds.

 



 

10. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder will be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (i) upon personal delivery to the Party notified, (ii) five days after deposit with the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (iii) one day after deposit with a nationally recognized air courier service such as DHL or Federal Express for next day delivery, (iv) on the day of email transmission if such email is received by 5:00 p.m., local time at the location of receipt, on a Business Day (otherwise on the next Business Day), to the email address shown below (or to such other email address as the Party to be notified may indicate by ten days advance written notice to the other Party in the manner herein provided) or (v) on the day of facsimile transmission if such facsimile is received by 5:00 p.m., local time at the location of receipt, on a Business Day (otherwise on the next Business Day), with written confirmation of receipt, to the facsimile number shown below (or to such other facsimile number as the Party to be notified may indicate by ten days advance written notice to the other Party in the manner herein provided), _provided_ that notice is also given under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above; in any such case addressed to the Party to be notified at the address indicated below for that Party, or at such other address as that Party may indicate by ten days advance written notice to the other Party in the manner herein provided:

14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

15. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and thereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof. This Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations of Buyer or Seller under the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

16. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

17. _Governing Law_.

18. _Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

      
 

 



 

19. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

20. _Succession and Assignment_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of Buyer and Seller
and Escrow Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that both Buyer and Seller may (i)
assign any or all of their respective rights and interests hereunder to one or
more of their respective Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more of their
respective Affiliates to perform their respective obligations hereunder (in
any or all of which cases Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, nonetheless
shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
hereunder). The Buyer and Seller agrees to notify the Escrow Agent in writing
prior to the Buyer and Seller assigning any and all of their respective rights
and interests hereunder to one or more of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions in _Section 20(a)_, any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with
which it may be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or
substantially as a whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any
such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow
Agent is a party, shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this
Agreement and shall have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities
and privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.

 



 

21. _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_. The Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by means of the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of _Exhibit C-1_ or _Exhibit C-2_ attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow Agent shall become a part of this Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, _Exhibit C-1_ or _Exhibit C-2_ may be revised or rescinded only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised _Exhibit C-1_ or _C-2_ or a rescission of an existing _Exhibit C-1_

      
 

 



 

or _C-2_ is delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-
interest to such Party, such document shall be accompanied by additional
documentation satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has
succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the Party under this
Agreement.

 



 

The Parties understand that the Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm
funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected by
such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and
agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any
such delay.

 



 

22. _Publication; Disclosure_. By executing this Agreement, the Parties and the Escrow Agent acknowledge that this Agreement (including related attachments) contains certain information that is sensitive and confidential in nature and agree that such information needs to be protected from improper disclosure, including the publication or dissemination of this Agreement and related information to individuals or entities not a Party to this Agreement (other than to such Partys representatives, agents, advisors and affiliates who have a need to receive this Agreement). The Parties further agree to take reasonable measures to mitigate any risks associated with the publication or disclosure of this Agreement and information contained therein, including, without limitation, the redaction of the manual signatures of the signatories to this Agreement, or, in the alternative, publishing a conformed copy of this Agreement. If a Party must disclose or publish this Agreement or information contained therein pursuant to any regulatory, statutory, or governmental requirement, as well as any judicial, or administrative order, subpoena or discovery request, it shall notify in writing the other Party and the Escrow Agent at the time of execution of this Agreement of the legal requirement to do so. If any Party becomes aware of any threatened or actual unauthorized disclosure, publication or use of this Agreement, that Party shall promptly notify in writing the other Parties and the Escrow Agent and shall be liable for any unauthorized release or disclosure.

 



 

23. _Termination_. If Buyer has not delivered to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount within one Business Day after the twelve month anniversary of the date hereof, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect, except with respect to provisions hereof which by their terms expressly survive such termination.

 ** _EXHIBIT C-1_**

 



 

Buyer certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses
and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit C-1
identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm
transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of Buyer, and
that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit C-1 is the security
procedure selected by Buyer for use in verifying that a funds transfer
instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Buyer.

 



 

Buyer has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that the
option checked in Part III of this Exhibit C-1 best meets its requirements;
given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will issue to the
Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in Part III of
this Exhibit C-1, Buyer acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other
security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer
instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the
Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen by
Buyer.

 



 

 _NOTICE_ : The security procedure selected by Buyer will not be used to
detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Buyer. If a funds
transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently
by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account
number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If
a funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution
inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number
may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution.
Therefore, it is important that Buyer take such steps as it deems prudent to
ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer
instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent.

The security procedure to be used with respect to funds transfer instructions

 ** _EXHIBIT C-2_**

 



 

Seller certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses
and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit C-2
identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm
transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of Seller and
that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit C-2 is the security
procedure selected by Seller for use in verifying that a funds transfer
instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Seller.

 



 

Seller has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that
the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit C-2 best meets its
requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will
issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in
Part III of this Exhibit C-2, Seller acknowledges that it has elected to not
use the other security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any
funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security
procedure chosen by Seller.

 



 

 _NOTICE_ : The security procedure selected by Seller will not be used to
detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Seller. If a funds
transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently
by name and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account
number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If
a funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution
inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number
may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution.
Therefore, it is important that Seller take such steps as it deems prudent to
ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer
instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent.

 ** _Important information about identifying our customers_**

 



 

 _To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify,
and record information that identifies each person (individual, corporation,
partnership, trust, estate or other entity recognized as a legal person) for
whom we open an account. What this means for you: Before we open an account,
we will ask for your name, address, date of birth (for individuals), TIN/EIN
or other information that will allow us to identify you or your company. For
individuals, this could mean identifying documents such as a driver s
license. For a corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity
recognized as a legal person, this could mean identifying documents such as a
Certificate of Formation from the issuing state agency._

or unenforceable provision will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such
provision had never been contained herein and there had been contained in this

nearly accomplish the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision.

 



 

6.8 _Amendments and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by both Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by
Party entitled to enforcement of the waived provision. No failure or delay by
either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement

other right, power or privilege.

 **ARTICLE II 
REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Shelf Registration_. As soon as reasonably practicable and in no case
more than 14 days following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreements, the Company shall prepare and (subject to receipt
by the Company of any financial statements (together with all consents and
reports required for the inclusion therein) that are deliverable pursuant to
Section 6.18 of the Purchase Agreements and required to be included in the
Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, if any) file
either, (i) if the Company is a WKSI, an automatic shelf registration
statement as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act or, (ii) if the Company
is not a WKSI, an initial registration statement under the Securities Act, in
each case to permit the public resale of Registrable Securities then
outstanding from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 of the Securities Act
(a " _Registration Statement_ "). The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as
soon as practicable but in no case later than 120 days after the date of
filing of such Registration Statement (the " _Filing Date_ "). The Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.l(a)_ to be continuously
effective under the Securities Act until the earliest to occur of the
following: (i) all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement have been

 



      
 

 



 

distributed in the manner set forth and as contemplated in such Registration
Statement, (ii) there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding and
(iii) two years from the Effective Date (in each case of _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_
and _(iii)_ , the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). In addition, as soon as
practicable following receipt of written notice from the Holders of a majority
of the Registrable Securities requesting the filing of an additional
Registration Statement (which notice may not be given any earlier than 60 days
prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date of the initial
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)), the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file such
additional Registration Statement under the Securities Act covering the
Registrable Securities. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such additional Registration Statement to become
effective no later than 120 days after the Filing Date. The Company will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such additional Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ to be continuously
effective under the Securities Act for the Effectiveness Period. A
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.l(a)_ shall be on
such appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by
the Company. A Registration Statement when declared effective (including the
documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (and, in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under which a statement is made). As soon as practicable following the date
that a Registration Statement becomes effective, but in any event within five
(5) Business Days of such date, the Company shall provide the Holders with
written notice of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to file more
than two Registration Statements pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable
Securities are included in a Registration Statement, suspend such Selling
Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of such Registration Statement
(in which event the Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) if (i) the Company is
pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction and the Company determines in good faith that the Companys
ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially and
adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in such
Registration Statement (a " _Subject Transaction_ ") or (ii) the Company has
experienced some other material non-public event, the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would materially and
adversely affect the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant
to such Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 60
days in any 180 day period or 105 days in any 365 day period. Upon disclosure
of such information or the termination of the condition described above, the
Company shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in such Registration Statement, and shall promptly
terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such
other actions necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. If the Company
exercises its suspension rights under this _Section 2.1(b)_, then during such
suspension period the Company shall not engage in any transaction involving
the offer, issuance, sale or purchase of Company

 



      
 

 



 

equity securities (whether for the benefit of the Company or any other
Person), except in connection with (i) the Subject Transaction, if applicable,
and (ii) transactions involving the issuance or purchase of Company equity
securities as contemplated by Company employee benefit plans or employee or
director arrangements. The Company will only exercise its suspension rights
under _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ of this _Section 2.1(b)_ if it exercises
similar suspension rights under all other registration agreements to which any
Other Holder (defined herein) is a party.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If at any time the Company proposes to file (i) at a time
when the Company is not a WKSI, a Registration Statement and such Holder has
not previously included its Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement
contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement that is currently
effective, or (ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective "automatic"
registration statement, so long as the Company is a WKSI at such time or,
whether or not the Company is a WKSI, so long as the Registrable Securities
were previously included in the underlying shelf Registration Statement or are
included on an effective Registration Statement, or in any case in which
Holders may participate in such offering without the filing of a post-
effective amendment, in each case, for the sale of Common Units in an
Underwritten Offering for its own account and/or the account of another
Person, other than (a) a registration relating solely to employee benefit
plans, (b) a registration relating solely to a Rule 145 transaction, or (c) a
registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales,
then the Company shall give not less than three Business Days notice
(including, but not limited to, notification by electronic mail) (the "
_Piggyback Notice_ ") of such proposed Underwritten Offering to each Holder
(together with its Affiliates) owning more than $32.5 million of Common Units,
calculated on the basis of the Purchased Unit Price, and such Piggyback Notice
shall offer such Holder the opportunity to include in such Underwritten
Offering such number of Registrable Securities (the " _Included Registrable
Securities_ ") as such Holder may request in writing (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to offer such opportunity (aa) to such Holders if the Holders, together with
their Affiliates, do not offer a minimum of $20 million of Registrable
Securities, in the aggregate (determined by multiplying the number of
Registrable Securities owned by the average of the closing price on the NYSE
for the Common Units for the ten trading days preceding the date of such
notice), or (bb) to such Holders if and to the extent that the Company has
been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable
Securities for sale for the benefit of such Holders will have a material
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Units in the
Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered
for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of
_Section 2.2(b)_. Each Piggyback Notice shall be provided to Holders on a
Business Day pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Each such Holder will have two
Business Days (or one Business Day in connection with any overnight or bought
Underwritten Offering) after such Piggyback Notice has been delivered to
specifically request in writing the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the
Underwritten Offering. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is received
within the specified time, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Piggyback Registration. If, at any time after giving
written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering and
prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Company shall
determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such Underwritten
Offering, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such

 



      
 

 



 

determination to the Selling Holders and, (AA) in the case of a determination
not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its
obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection with such
terminated Underwritten Offering, and (BB) in the case of a determination to
delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any
Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the
Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw
such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving written notice
to the Company of such withdrawal up to and including the time of pricing of
such offering. Any Holder may deliver written notice (a " _Piggyback Opt-Out
Notice_ ") to the Company requesting that such Holder not receive notice from
the Company of any proposed Underwritten Offering; _provided, however_ , that
such Holder may later revoke any such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice in writing.
Following receipt of a Piggyback Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless
subsequently revoked), the Company shall not be required to deliver any notice
to such Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ and such Holder shall no
longer be entitled to participate in Underwritten Offerings by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_, unless such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice is
revoked by such Holder.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering advise the Company that the
total amount of Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders and any other
Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold
in such offering without being likely to have a material adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Units offered or the market for
the Common Units, then the Common Units to be included in such Underwritten
Offering shall include the number of Registrable Securities that such Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters advise the Company can be sold without having such
adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the Company or
such other Person on whose behalf the primary registration or offering is
being made and (ii) second, pro rata among the Selling Holders and any other
Persons who have been or are granted registration rights on or after the date
of this Agreement (the " _Other Holders_ "), who have requested participation
in the Piggyback Registration (based, for each such Selling Holder or Other
Holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (A) the number of Common Units
proposed to be sold by such Selling Holder or such Other Holder in such
offering; by (B) the aggregate number of Common Units proposed to be sold by
all Selling Holders and all Other Holders in the Piggyback Registration).

 



 

(c) _Termination of Piggyback Registration Rights_. Each Holders rights under
this _Section 2.2_ shall terminate upon such Holder (together with its
Affiliates) ceasing to hold at least $32.5 million of Registrable Securities
(based on the Purchased Unit Price).

 



 

Section 2.3 _Underwritten Offering_.

 



 

(a) _S-3 Registration_. In the event that a Selling Holder (together with any
Affiliates that are Selling Holders) elects to dispose of Registrable
Securities under a Registration Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering
of at least $32.5 million dollars of Registrable Securities, the Company
shall, at the request of such Selling Holder, enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
selected by the Company, which shall include, among other provisions,
indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in _Section 2.8_, and
shall take all such other reasonable actions as are

 



       
 

 



 

requested by the Managing Underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) _General Procedures_. In connection with any underwriting agreement
contemplated by _Section 2.3(a)_, each Selling Holder and the Company shall
be obligated to enter into such underwriting agreement that contains such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to _Section 2.8_) and other
rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting agreements for firm
commitment offerings of equity securities. No Selling Holder may participate
in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder agrees to sell its
Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting agreement
and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities
and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
agreement. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder, its
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, such Selling Holder may elect to withdraw
therefrom by notice to the Company and the Managing Underwriter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such withdrawal must be made at least one Business Day prior
to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be effective. No such
withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the Companys obligation to pay
Registration Expenses. The Companys management may but shall not be required
to participate in a roadshow or similar marketing effort in connection with
any Underwritten Offering contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under this
_Article II_, the Company will, as expeditiously as possible:

 



 

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to a
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the
Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing
of an Underwritten Offering under a Registration Statement and the Managing
Underwriter at any time shall notify the Company in writing that, in the sole
judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information to be
used in such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the success of
such Underwritten Offering, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to include such information in the prospectus supplement;

 



 

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object

 



      
 

 



 

to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of
distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections reasonably
requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to
filing such Registration Statement or such other registration statement and
the prospectus included therein or any supplement or amendment thereto, and
(ii) such number of copies of such Registration Statement or such other
registration statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements
and amendments thereto as such Persons may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement or other registration statement;

 



 

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Company will not be
required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject
it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject;

 



 

(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same
has become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the
Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any
written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to any such
Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any prospectus
or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



 

(f) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made);
(ii) the issuance or express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the Company
agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the prospectus or
prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus
or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then

 



      
 

 



 

existing and to take such other commercially reasonable action as is necessary
to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related
thereto;

 



 

(g) subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, furnish to each
Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or other
correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or self-
regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic or
foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish, or cause to be
furnished, upon request, (i) an opinion of counsel for the Company addressed
to the underwriters, dated the date of the closing under the applicable
underwriting agreement and (ii) a "comfort" letter addressed to the
underwriters, dated the pricing date of such Underwritten Offering and a
letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the applicable
underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the independent public
accountants who have certified the Companys financial statements included or
incorporated by reference into the applicable registration statement, and each
of the opinion and the "comfort" letter shall be in customary form and
covering substantially the same matters with respect to such registration
statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement) as have been
customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants
letters delivered to the underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities
by the Company and such other matters as such underwriters may reasonably
request;

 



 

(i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section l1(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

 



 

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders during normal business hours access to such
information and Company personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable
such parties to establish a due diligence defense under the Securities Act;
_provided, however_ , that the Company need not disclose any non-public
information to any such representative unless and until such representative
has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company;

 



 

(k) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable
Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement to be listed on each
securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation system on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed;

 



 

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Registrable Securities to
be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Company to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities;

 



 

(m) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by any registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration statement;

 



      
 

 



 

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities; and

 



 

(o) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such
Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale
and distribution of Registrable Securities, including information with respect
to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase
price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the
Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and (ii) make all required
filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after being
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment.

 



 

The Company shall not name a Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section
2(a)(11) of the Securities Act) in any registration statement without such
Holders consent. If the staff of the Commission requires the Company to name
any Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities
Act) or the Company deems it advisable, on the advice of counsel, to so name
any Holder, and such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders
Registrable Securities shall not be included on the applicable registration
statement, the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder with
respect to Registrable Securities held by such Holder and such Holder shall
have been deemed to have terminated this Agreement with respect to such
Holder.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening
of any event of the kind described in subsection (f) of this _Section 2.4_,
shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable Securities by
means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such Selling Holders
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by subsection (f) of this _Section 2.4_ or until it is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in
the prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, such Selling Holder will,
or will request the Managing Underwriter or Managing Underwriters, if any, to
deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies in their
possession or control, other than permanent file copies then in such Selling
Holders possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no obligation to
include Registrable Securities of a Holder in a Registration Statement or in
an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ who has failed to
timely furnish such information that the Company determines, after
consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for any
registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with
the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities included in a Registration
Statement agrees to enter into a customary letter agreement with underwriters
providing that such Holder will not effect any public sale or distribution of
Registrable Securities during the 45 calendar day period beginning on the date
of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the Commission with
respect to

 



      
 

 



 

the pricing of any Underwritten Offering; _provided, however_ , that (i) the
duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of
the shortest restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on the Company
or the officers, directors or any other Affiliate of the Company on whom a
restriction is imposed and (ii) the restrictions set forth in this _Section
2.6_ shall not apply to any Registrable Securities that are included in such
Underwritten Offering by such Holder. In addition, this _Section 2.6_ shall
not apply to any Holder that is not entitled to participate in such
Underwritten Offering, whether because such Holder delivered a Piggyback Opt-
Out Notice prior to receiving notice of the Underwritten Offering, because
such Holder holds less than $32.5 million of the Common Units, calculated on
the basis of the Purchased Unit Price, or because the Registrable Securities
of such Holder have become eligible for resale pursuant to any section of Rule
144 under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect) without
any restriction (including, if the Holder is an Affiliate of the Company,
restrictions that apply to sales by Affiliates).

 



 

Section 2.7 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to the Companys performance under or compliance with this Agreement
to effect the registration of Registrable Securities on a Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 2.1_, a Piggyback Registration pursuant to
_Section 2.2_, or an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.3_, and
the disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation,
all registration, filing, securities exchange listing and NYSE fees, all
registration, filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying
with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, fees of transfer agents and registrars, all word processing,
duplicating and printing expenses, and the fees and disbursements of counsel
and independent public accountants for the Company, including the expenses of
any special audits or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such
performance and compliance. " _Selling Expenses_ " means all underwriting
fees, discounts and selling commissions and transfer taxes allocable to the
sale of the Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses, as
determined in good faith, in connection with a shelf Registration, a Piggyback
Registration or an Underwritten Offering, whether or not any sale is made
pursuant to such shelf Registration, Piggyback Registration or Underwritten
Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling
Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.
In addition, except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.8_, the Company shall
not be responsible for professional fees (including legal fees) incurred by
Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By the Company_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its
directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who
controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively,
the " _Selling Holder Indemnified Persons_ "), against any losses, claims,
damages, expenses or liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_
"), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder Indemnified Person may
become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any
prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which such statement is made)
contained in the applicable Registration Statement or other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus,
prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified
Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be liable in
any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in the
applicable Registration Statement or other registration statement, or
prospectus supplement, as applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by such Selling Holder.

 



 

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Managing Member, the
Managing Members directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person,
who, directly or indirectly, controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Company to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to
information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf
of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in a Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or
final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not
be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any
Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section
2.8(c)_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In any action brought against any indemnified
party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this _Section 2.8_ for any

 



      
 

 



 

legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of
liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses
related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified
party with respect to which such indemnified party may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party, unless
the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, includes a
complete release from liability of, and does not contain any admission of
wrongdoing by, the indemnified party.

 



 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.8_
is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any Selling Holder be required to contribute an
aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling
Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other,
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information
supplied by such party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an
indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence
of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall be in
addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.9 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all
times from and after the date hereof;

 



 

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

 



 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the Company
that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and (ii) unless otherwise available via the Commissions EDGAR
filing system, to such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent
annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and
documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of
any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such
securities without registration.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Company to register Registrable Securities granted by the Company
under this _Article II_ may be transferred or assigned by each Holder to one
or more transferees or assignees of Registrable Securities; _provided,
however_ , that (a) unless any such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of,
and after such transfer or assignment continues to be an Affiliate of, such
Holder, the amount of Registrable Securities transferred or assigned to such
transferee or assignee shall represent at least $32.5 million of Registrable
Securities (based on the Purchased Unit Price), (b) the Company is given
written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each such transferee or assignee and identifying the securities
with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or
assigned, (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing
responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such transferring Holder
under this Agreement and (d) the transferor or assignor is not relieved of any
obligations or liabilities hereunder arising out of events occurring prior to
such transfer.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Registrable Securities, enter
into any agreement with any current or future holder of any securities of the
Company that would allow such current or future holder to require the Company
to include securities in any registration statement filed by the Company on a
basis other than _pari passu_ with, or expressly subordinate to, the piggyback
rights of the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder.

neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations

unit splits, recapitalizations, pro rata distributions of units and the like
occurring after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of this
Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain,
and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to seek an
injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it
may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to
grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this
right will not preclude any such Person from pursuing any other rights and
remedies at law or in equity that such Person may have.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered,
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken

termination, performance or nonperformance of this Agreement (including any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws that might otherwise require the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any action against any
party relating to the foregoing shall be brought in any federal or state court
of competent jurisdiction located within the State of Delaware, and the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any federal or state court located within the State of Delaware over any such
action. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of

hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

is held to be illegal, invalid, not binding, or unenforceable, such provision
shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as

upon, restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set
forth or referred to herein or in the Purchase Agreements with respect to the
rights and obligations of the Company, the Investors or any of their
respective Affiliates hereunder or thereunder, and each of the Company and the
Investors expressly disclaims that it is owed any duties or is entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by the Company and the Holders of a majority of the
then outstanding Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any Holder hereunder without
the consent of such Holder. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to
any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the Company or any Investor
from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which such amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or consent has been made or given.
