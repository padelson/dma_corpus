date (such Business Day, the " _Closing Condition Satisfaction Date_ ") which
shall be the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as Buyer and
Seller may agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if the Buyer
Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to
the Closing Condition Satisfaction Date, then, at Buyers election (which

Closing until (i) any Business Day before or during the Buyer Marketing Period
as may be requested by Buyer by no less than two Business Days prior written
notice to Seller; (ii) the second Business Day following the final day of the

Date, then, at Sellers election (which shall be delivered in

 



      
 

 



 

writing), Seller shall have the right to postpone the Closing until (i) any
Business Day before or during the Seller Marketing Period as may be requested
by Seller by no less than two Business Days prior written notice to Buyer;
(ii) the second Business Day following the final day of the Seller Marketing
Period; or (iii) such other date and time as Buyer and Seller may agree in
writing; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if (x) the Closing would otherwise

week other than Thursday, the Closing shall occur on the next succeeding

Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." The effective time of the Share Purchase
(the " _Effective Time_ ") shall be 3:01 a.m. on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Seller Closing Deliverables_. At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer:

 



 

(a) a certificate or certificates evidencing all of the Shares, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank, in proper form
for transfer;

 



 

(b) to the extent obtained following the exercise of reasonable best efforts
by Seller, the written resignations of the members of the board of directors
of the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
effective prior to or concurrently with the Closing;

 



 

(c) a certificate duly executed by an authorized officer of Seller in the form
specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv) to the effect that
Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the
Code;

 



 

(d) Sellers counterparts to the Seller-ABS TSA, the Seller-Company TSA and

Seller;

 



 

(e) the Payoff Letters;

 



 

(f) UCC-3 termination statements and other evidence reasonably satisfactory to

respective assets set forth in Section 1.3(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
will be released upon consummation of the Share Purchase in accordance with
the terms hereof;

 



 

(g) Sellers counterpart to the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(h) the certificate contemplated by Section 6.3(c); and

 



 

(i) the Closing Date Capital Contribution, if any.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Buyer Closing Deliverables_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller:

 



 

(a) payment of the Closing Date Cash Consideration, if any, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account to be designated in writing by

Company, as applicable;

 



 

(d) a certified copy of the fully executed Supplemental Indenture, which shall
be effective on the Closing Date;

 



 

(e) Buyers, ASCs and the Escrow Agents counterparts to the Escrow

Section 1.5 _Delayed Closing_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in the event that all of the conditions to
closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied but the Change in Control
FCC Approval has not then been received or obtained, neither (a) the Common
Carrier FCC Licenses nor (b) as applicable, the Communications Subsidiary or
U.S. Satellite Corporation (" _USSC_ ") shall be transferred to the Company or
any designated Affiliate, and the Closing shall then occur with respect to the
Share Purchase as provided in Sections 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, subject to
subsections (b), (c) and (d) below (the date of such Closing, being, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Closing Date hereunder); _provided_ that the Closing
Date Cash Consideration otherwise payable to Seller shall be reduced, or the
Closing Date Capital Contribution payable by Seller shall be increased, as
applicable, by an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the " _Delayed Closing Purchase
Price_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event that the Closing occurs pursuant to subsection (a) above,
then there shall be a subsequent closing with respect to the transfer to the
Company or its designated Affiliate of (i) the Common Carrier FCC Licenses or
(ii) as applicable, the Communications Subsidiary or USSC (the " _Delayed
Closing_ "), as contemplated by the applicable FCC order and Section 5.23. For
the avoidance of doubt, neither (x) the Common Carrier FCC Licenses nor (y) as
applicable, the Communications Subsidiary or USSC shall be assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Closing of the Share Purchase unless
the Change in Control FCC Approval has been obtained prior to such time.

 



 

(c) The Delayed Closing shall occur on the third Business Day (the " _Delayed
Closing Date_ ") following receipt of the Change in Control FCC Approval, at
the offices of Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York
at 10:00 a.m. New York or at such other place or at such other time or on such
other date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree upon in writing. At the
Delayed Closing, Seller shall make such deliveries as may be reasonably
necessary to transfer, in accordance with the applicable FCC order, either (i)
the Common Carrier FCC Licenses or (ii) all of the equity interests in the
Communications Subsidiary or USSC, as applicable, to the Company or its
designated Affiliate, and Buyer shall deliver or cause the Company to deliver
to Seller the Delayed Closing Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated in writing by Seller no later
than three Business Days prior to the Delayed Closing Date; _provided_ that
for purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.1(e) upon resolution of the Final Closing Date Working Capital, the
Final Closing Date Cash Consideration otherwise payable to Seller shall be
reduced, or the Closing Date Capital Contribution payable by Seller shall be
increased, as applicable, by such Delayed Closing Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) If a Delayed Closing Date is required, from the Closing Date to the
Delayed Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall continue to comply, solely in
respect of the Communications Subsidiary or USSC, as applicable, with all
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that are required by
their terms to be performed prior to the Closing and, unless the context
clearly requires otherwise, all references in this Agreement to the "Closing"
or the "Closing Date" shall, with respect to the Communications Subsidiary or
USSC, as applicable, be deemed to refer to the Delayed Closing or the Delayed
Closing Date, respectively.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Net Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Date Statement_ ") of Sellers good faith estimate of (w)
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ "), (x) Store
Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Date Store Cash_ ") (y) Non-Cash Sales
Settlement Amount (the " _Estimated Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount_ ") and
(z) Asset Sales Proceeds (the " _Estimated Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds"_
) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
Closing Date and a detailed calculation thereof. The Estimated Closing Date
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions of "Working
Capital", "Store Cash" and "Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount" (as applicable)
set forth herein based on the Working Capital Standard. The "Trued-Up Amount"
shall be equal to (i) the Initial Purchase Price, _plus_ (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital over the Target Maximum
Working Capital, _less_ (ii) the excess, if any, of the Target Minimum Working
Capital over the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, _less_ (iii) the
excess, if any, of the Target Minimum Store Cash over the Estimated Closing
Date Store Cash, _plus_ (iv) the Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount, if any,
_less_ (v) the Asset Sales Proceeds, if any. If the Trued-Up Amount is a
positive amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased or reduced, as
applicable, to be equal to such Trued-Up Amount and, as so increased or
reduced, shall be paid to the Seller pursuant to Section 1.1. If the Trued-Up
Amount is a negative amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced to
zero and Seller shall contribute to the Company on the Closing Date, in cash,
the absolute amount by which the Trued-Up Amount is less than zero (the "
_Closing Date Capital Contribution_ "). The Initial Purchase Price as
increased or decreased (but not below zero) to the Trued-Up Amount shall be
the " _Closing Date Cash Consideration_ " that is payable by the Buyer
hereunder.

 



 

(b) Within 60 calendar days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement (as such may be
adjusted following resolution of disputes in accordance with Section 2.1(d),
the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") of

 



      
 

 



 

Working Capital (the " _Closing Date Working Capital_ "), Store Cash (the "
_Closing Date Store Cash_ "), Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount (the " _Closing
Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount_ ") and Asset Sales Proceeds (" _Closing
Date Asset Sales Proceeds_ ") of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and a detailed calculation thereof. The
Closing Date Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions of
"Working Capital", "Store Cash" and "Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount" and
"Asset Sales Proceeds" (as applicable) set forth herein, and (in the case of
Working Capital, Store Cash and Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount) on the basis
of the Working Capital Standard.

 



 

(c) After receipt of the Closing Date Statement, Seller shall have 45 calendar
days to review the Closing Date Statement, together with the work-papers used
in the preparation thereof. Seller and its authorized representatives shall
have reasonable access to all relevant personnel, books and records of Buyer,
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably required
to complete their review of the Closing Date Statement. Unless Seller delivers
written notice to Buyer on or prior to the 45th calendar day after Sellers
receipt of the Closing Date Statement, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date
Store Cash Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount and Closing Date
Asset Sales Proceeds. Seller shall set forth in such notice reasonable detail
for the basis of Sellers objection or objections and the adjustments to the
amount of Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Store Cash, Closing Date
Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount and/or Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds that
Seller believes should be made. If Seller so notifies Buyer of its objection
to the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital, Buyer and Seller shall,
within 30 calendar days following such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt to resolve their differences and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.

 



 

(d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in
dispute with respect to the Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Store
Cash, Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount and/or Closing Date Asset
Sales Proceeds, then all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to
Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Neutral Auditor_ "). Each party agrees to execute,
if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter, including
customary indemnities in favor of the Neutral Auditor. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne pro rata as between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar value of the amounts
remaining in dispute between Seller and Buyer made by the Neutral Auditor such
that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses.
The Neutral Auditor shall act as an expert to determine, based solely on the
provisions of this Section 2.1(d) and the presentations by Seller and Buyer,
and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and only as
to whether such amounts were arrived at in conformity with Section 2.1(a)
hereof or contain arithmetic error. The Neutral Auditors determination shall
be made within 30 calendar days of the submission of the amounts remaining in
dispute by the parties to the Neutral Auditor, shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding and
conclusive. The terms " _Final Closing Date Working Capital_ ", " _Final
Closing Date Store Cash_ ", " _Final Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement
Amount_ " and " _Final Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds_ ") shall mean,
respectively, the definitive Closing Date Working Capital, the definitive
Closing Date Store Cash, the definitive Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement
Amount and the definitive Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds

 



      
 

 



 

agreed to (or deemed to be agreed to) by Buyer and Seller in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.1(c) or, if applicable, the definitive Closing Date
Working Capital, Closing Date Store Cash, the definitive Closing Date Non-Cash
Sales Settlement Amount and the definitive Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds
resulting from the determinations made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance
with this Section 2.1(d) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by
Seller and Buyer).

 



 

(e) Upon resolution of the Final Closing Date Working Capital, the Final
Closing Date Store Cash, the Final Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement
Amount, and the Final Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds in accordance with
Section 2.1(d) above, the Closing Date Cash Consideration and Closing Date
Capital Contribution shall be recalculated in accordance with Section 2.1(a)
above but substituting Final Closing Date Working Capital for Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash for Estimated Closing
Date Cash, Final Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount for Estimated
Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount, and Final Closing Date Asset
Sales Proceeds for Estimated Closing Date Asset Sales Proceeds in the
calculation thereof (such recalculated amounts the " _Final Closing Date Cash
Consideration_ " and " _Final Closing Date Capital Contribution_ ,"
respectively).

 



 

(i) If (A) the Final Closing Date Cash Consideration is greater than the
Closing Date Cash Consideration, if any, paid by Buyer on the Closing Date,
Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller the excess of Final Closing
Date Cash Consideration over Closing Date Cash Consideration; or (B) the Final
Closing Date Cash Consideration (which may be zero) is less than the Closing
Date Cash Consideration paid by Buyer on the Closing Date, Seller shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to the Company and /or to ABS (at the direction of the
Company to the extent the payment pursuant to this Section 2.1 is determined
to be allocable to ABS in accordance with the APA) and/or to the Buyer (at the
direction of the Company to the extent cash has been contributed to the
Company by Buyer following the Closing and the Albertsons Asset Purchase), an
aggregate amount equal to the excess of Closing Date Cash Consideration over
Final Closing Date Cash Consideration.

 



 

(ii) In addition to, and not in lieu of, any payments under clause (i), if (A)
the Final Closing Date Capital Contribution (which may be zero) is less than
the Closing Date Capital Contribution, if any, made by Seller on the Closing
Date, Buyer shall pay (or caused to be paid) to Seller an amount equal to the
excess of the Closing Date Capital Contribution over the Final Closing Date
Capital Contribution; or (B) if the Closing Date Capital Contribution made by
Seller on the Closing Date is less than the Final Closing Date Capital
Contribution, Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company and/or ABS
(at the direction of the Company to the extent the payment pursuant to this
Section 2.1 is determined to be allocable to ABS in accordance with the APA)
and/or to the Buyer (at the direction of the Company to the extent cash has
been contributed to the Company by Buyer following the Closing and the
Albertsons Asset Purchase), an aggregate amount equal to the excess of the
Final Closing Date Capital Contribution over the Closing Date Capital
Contribution.

 



 

Any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(e), together with interest
on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at a per annum
rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the Closing Date, shall be paid by wire transfer

 



       
 

 



 

of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified by the
party entitled thereto, within five Business Days after the later of (x) the
date that Final Closing Date Working Capital, Final Closing Date Store Cash,
Final Closing Date Non-Cash Sales Settlement Amount and Final Closing Date
Asset Sales Proceeds are agreed to by Buyer and Seller or any remaining
disputed items are ultimately determined by the Neutral Auditor and (y) the
date that KPMG completes the Agreed-Upon Procedures and delivers its report
thereon.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER**

 



 

Except as disclosed (a) in the forms, documents and reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Seller on or after February 27, 2010, and prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Seller SEC Documents_ "), to the extent the
relevance of such disclosure to the applicable representation and the
applicability of such disclosure to the Company and its Subsidiaries is
reasonably apparent (excluding, in each case, (i) any disclosures contained or
referenced therein under the caption "Forward-Looking Statements," any
forward-looking statements or risk factor disclosures referenced therein under
the caption "Risk Factors" and any other forward-looking statements of risk
that do not contain a reasonable level of detail about the risks of which such
statements warn, or (ii) any exhibits to such Seller SEC Documents); or (b) in
the corresponding section or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered by
the Company to Buyer immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that

Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other section or
subsection to the extent that the relevance of any disclosed event, item or
occurrence in such Seller Disclosure Letter to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent), Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as
follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._ Each of Seller,
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, a "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means an event or effect that is
materially adverse to the business or financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall
not include events or effects relating to or resulting from (i) changes in
general economic or political conditions or the securities, credit or
financial markets in general, except to the extent such change has a
disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
when compared to other companies operating in the same industries and markets
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any decline in the
market price or trading volume of the Companys securities (it being
understood that the underlying cause of such decline may be taken into account
in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred to

 



      
 

 



 

the extent it is not excluded by another clause of this definition); (iii)
general changes or developments in the industries or markets in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including general changes in Law or
regulation across such industries and markets, except to the extent such
change has a disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, when compared to other companies operating in the same
industries and markets in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (iv)
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the APA or the public
announcement or pendency of the Transactions or the Albertsons Asset Sale,
including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise,
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with employees, customers, suppliers
or partners; (v) the identity of Buyer or any of its Affiliates as the
acquiror of the Company; (vi) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of
any action required by, this Agreement, including the actions permitted by the
last sentence of Section 5.1(c) or required by Section 5.17(h)(ii); (vii) any
acts of terrorism or war, except to the extent such act has a disproportionate
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to
other companies operating in the same industries and markets in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (viii) any hurricane, tornado, flood,
earthquake, natural disasters, acts of God or other comparable events, except
to the extent such event has a disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to other companies operating in
the same industries and markets in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate; (ix) changes in applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
accounting principles or the interpretation thereof after the date hereof; (x)
any failure to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or
earning predictions for any period (it being understood that the underlying
cause of such failure may be taken into account in determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred to the extent it is not excluded
by another clause of this definition); or (xi) any matter disclosed in Section
3.11 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 100 shares of

issued and outstanding. All outstanding Shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, are not subject to and were not issued
in violation of any preemptive or similar right, purchase option, call or
right of first refusal or similar right. Seller is the record and beneficial
owner of the Shares and has good, valid and marketable title to all of the
Shares, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Seller is not
a party to any option, warrant, purchase right or other contract or commitment
that could require Seller to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any the
Shares (other than this Agreement). Seller is not a party to any voting trust,
proxy, or other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any
capital stock of the Company. Upon payment for the Shares by Buyer pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall transfer to Buyer good, valid and
marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions on transfer arising solely under applicable federal and state
securities Laws or Liens created by Buyer).

 



 

(b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements or commitments
relating to the issuance of capital stock to which the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries is a party obligating the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries to (i) issue, transfer or sell any shares of

 



      
 

 



 

capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests; (ii) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar right,
agreement or arrangement; or (iii) redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares
of capital stock or other equity interests. From September 6, 2012 to the date
hereof, the Company has not declared or paid any dividend or distribution in
respect of the Common Stock, and has not issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed
or otherwise acquired any Common Stock, and its Board of Directors has not
authorized any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) (i) Section 3.2(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
correct list of the Subsidiaries of the Company, not taking into account the
actions permitted by the last sentence of Section 5.1(c).

 



 

(ii) All outstanding securities of each Subsidiary of the Company are owned
beneficially and of record by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company and
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. With
respect to each Subsidiary of the Company, there are no outstanding options,
warrants, profits interests, phantom equity, stock appreciation rights or
other rights, Contracts or arrangements existing or outstanding which provide
for the sale or issuance of any of shares of capital stock or other securities
of any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other similar obligations, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 



 

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries own any ownership interest
greater than $100,000 in value in any other person other than securities in a
publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock
of such company.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to consummate the
Transactions. The Board of Directors of Seller at a duly held meeting has

other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize
the consummation of such transactions. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Seller and the Company and, assuming this

Seller Disclosure Letter (collectively, clauses (A) through (F), the "
_Specified Approvals_ "), and other than any consent, approval, authorization,
permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in Section 3.3(b) and the
receipt of the Specified Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance
(i) by Seller and the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by Seller
and the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) by Seller of

reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transactions ( _provided_ that subclause (iv) in the definition of "Company
Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of this Section
3.3(c)).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements or commitments

Company Material Adverse Effect.

considered in the preparation thereof, the Initial Purchase Price to be
received by Seller pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point
of view, to Seller; (ii) the opinion of Goldman Sachs and Co. (" _Goldman_ "),
dated as of January 10, 2013, substantially to the effect that, subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters considered in the
preparation thereof, the Initial Purchase Price to be paid to Seller for all
of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of

course of business), including indebtedness evidenced by a note, bond,
debenture or similar instrument; (B) obligations to pay rent or other amounts

default under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach or
default would

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To Sellers Knowledge, no other party to any Company
Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any Company
Material Contract where such breach or default would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Material Contract
is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiary of the
Company which is party thereto and, to Sellers Knowledge, of each other party

be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights
generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought. Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, as of
the date hereof, none of Seller, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any counterparty that such
counterparty (x) intends to terminate, or not renew, any Company Material
Contract, or (y) is seeking the renegotiation thereof in any material respect
or substitute performance thereunder in any material respect. Complete and
correct copies of each Company Material Contract, as amended or modified, have
been delivered or made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 3.19 _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.19 of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of all current insurance policies and excess self-insurance

or their respective assets and business as of the date hereof (the "
_Insurance Policies_ "), including in respect of each such Insurance Policy,
the policy name, policy number, carrier, term, type and amount of coverage and
annual premium and/or collateral. The Insurance Policies are for such amounts
as required by Law and any Company Material Contract. The Insurance Policies
are in full force and effect, all premiums and/or collateral have been posted
in necessary amounts or have otherwise been paid, and each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is otherwise in compliance with the terms and provisions of
such Insurance Policies, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) excluding insurance policies that have
expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, none of the
Insurance Policies have been cancelled, terminated or received notice of
nonrenewal, collateral deficiency and, to Sellers Knowledge, no threat has
been made to cancel, terminate or refuse to renew any Insurance Policy of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance with respect to its business or
its assets by any insurance carrier to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has applied for insurance or with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has carried insurance; and (iii) as of the date of this
Agreement, the limits of the Insurance Policies have not been eroded and there
is no claim pending under any of the Insurance Policies as to which coverage
has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) (i) The workers compensation insurance of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in material compliance with and has been in material
compliance since February 27, 2010, with all applicable Laws as to the terms,
conditions and amounts of such coverage; (ii) in any jurisdiction where the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has self-insured any part of its
workers compensation insurance liability, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have posted and updated all collateral in all material respects as required by
applicable Laws and no Governmental Entities have drawn down on any financial
instrument posted to satisfy such collateral requirements; (iii) the Company
and its Subsidiaries have provided Buyer with complete and true copies of the
Insurance Policies, related agreements for the indemnification of insurers
(collectively, the " _Workers Compensation Policy(ies)_ "), and the financial
reserve data regarding the Companys and its Subsidiarys worker compensation
liability that is contained in the documents set forth on Section 3.19(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter; and (iv) the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of each Workers
Compensation Policy.

 



 

Section 3.20 _Affiliate Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries are party to any Contract, commitment, transaction or any other
arrangement with, or in favor or for the benefit of, Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (each, an "
_Affiliate Transaction_ "). Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) provide any services or products to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, other than centralized corporate functions and
services (including finance, tax, accounting, legal, human resources,
marketing, merchandising, information technology and communications functions
and services) and periodic support by the Sellers headquarters personnel on
an "as-needed" basis.

 



 

Section 3.21 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for the Seller Financial Advisors
(the payment of fees and expenses of which shall be the obligation of Seller
and not the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), neither Seller, the Company
nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries have employed any investment banker,
broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement who might be entitled to any fee, commission or expense
reimbursement from the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with or upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Seller, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries.

are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Refinancing Lenders to
provide the Refinancing or any contingencies that would permit the Refinancing
Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Refinancing. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of Buyers representations and warranties in Article IV
of this Agreement, Seller does not have any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied
by it in any of the Refinancing Commitment Letters on the Closing Date, nor
does Seller have Knowledge that any of the Refinancing Lenders will not
perform its obligations thereunder.

this Section 3.22(d) are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "

(e) As of the date hereof, the Refinancing Commitment Letters are valid,
binding and in full force and effect and, to Sellers Knowledge, assuming the
accuracy of Buyers representations and warranties in Article IV of this, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Seller under the terms and
conditions of the Refinancing Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof,
Seller has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Refinancing Commitment Letters on or
before the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of the

ability to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Share Purchase, to obtain

merger notification report under the HSR Act; (ii) compliance with any
applicable state securities or blue sky laws; and (iii) the Specified

individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Share Purchase by Buyer do not and will not (i) contravene
or conflict with the organizational or governing documents of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referenced in

Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and

pending (or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened) against or affecting Buyer or
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties at law or in equity

(a) Buyer has received and accepted executed commitment letters dated January
10, 2013, and attached as Annex G (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment
Letters_ ") from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Buyer

" _Equity Investors_ ") pursuant to which the Equity Investors have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Buyer the amounts
set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and together with the
Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Financing Commitments_ "). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides that Seller and the Company are third-party

Debt Financing).

 



 

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Buyer Lenders and the Equity
Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the
Buyer Lenders or the Equity Investors to reduce the total amount of the
Financing. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of Sellers
representations and warranties in Article III of this Agreement, Buyer does
not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment
Letters on the Closing Date, nor does Buyer have Knowledge that any of the
Buyer Lenders or Equity Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 and
that the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the Commitment
Letters, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters,

Price, the payments contemplated by Section 5.11 and payment of any fees and
expenses of or payable by Buyer hereunder) and the APA.

 



 

(e) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are valid, binding and in
full force and effect and, to Buyers Knowledge, assuming the accuracy of
Sellers representations and warranties in Article III of this Agreement, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Buyer under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Buyer has paid in
full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement.
As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters has been modified,
amended or altered and none of the respective commitments under any of the
Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

 



 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Buyer or any
Affiliate or any other

 



      
 

 



 

financing or other transactions be a condition to Buyers obligations
hereunder; _provided_ that it is understood and agreed by Seller that Seller
shall not have the right to obtain specific performance to cause Buyer to
consummate the Closing except to the extent expressly permitted by Section
8.5.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Sponsor Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller the guarantee addressed to Seller
from Cerberus Institutional Partners V, L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ ") in the form
attached as Annex I to this Agreement, in respect of certain payment
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement to the same extent as if Sponsor
were a party thereto, in each case on the terms set forth therein (the "
_Sponsor Guarantee_ "). The Sponsor Guarantee is valid and in full force and
effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Sponsor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms. No event has occurred, which, with
or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the
part of the Sponsor under the Sponsor Guarantee.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Solvency_. Buyer has received a favorable solvency opinion from
Duff and Phelps, LLC, dated as of January 8, 2013, as to the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the Transactions and the Albertsons Asset Purchase. Assuming
the accuracy of Section 3.4(a), immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the Transactions and the Albertsons Asset Purchase, (a) the
fair saleable value (determined on a going-concern basis) of the assets of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall be greater than the total amount of
liabilities of such person and its Subsidiaries and (b) Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall be able to pay their debts and obligations in the ordinary
course of business as they come due. In computing the amount of contingent or
unliquidated liabilities for purposes of this Section 4.6, such liabilities

furnished or made available to Buyer and its Representatives except as
expressly set forth in Article III, and neither Seller, its directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives, nor any other person
shall be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other person resulting from
Sellers making available to Buyer or Buyers use of such information,
including the management presentation materials delivered to Buyer, as
subsequently updated, supplemented or amended (the " _Confidential Information
Memorandum_ "), or any information, documents or material made available to
Buyer in the due diligence materials provided to Buyer, including in the data
room, other management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form

waives any such claim relating to the foregoing matters. Except as expressly
set forth in Article III, Buyer is acquiring the Company without any
representations or warranties, express or implied, as to merchantability,
satisfactory quality, or fitness for any particular purpose, in an "as is"
condition and on a "where is" basis.

greater than five percent (5%) in a person that owns, controls, or operates in
the United States a business (other than the business operated by Albertsons

Section 5.2 _Access_.

 



 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and Sellers and the Companys
obligations under Section 5.8, Seller and the Company shall afford to Buyer
and to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Buyer Representatives_ ") full access during normal business hours,
throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties (including
access to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments), Contracts,
commitments, books and records, other than any such matters that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding,
subject to Section 5.8, Seller and the Company shall not be required to afford
such access if Seller and the Company believe in good faith that affording
such access would

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
would cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade
secret protection to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law or delay Closing, nor shall Buyer
or any Buyer Representative be permitted to perform any invasive procedure
with respect to any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

 



 

(b) Buyer hereby agrees that all information provided to it or any Buyer
Representative in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with,
the confidentiality agreement, dated as of July 31, 2012, between Seller and
Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) Commencing on the date hereof, each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its
Representatives, upon reasonable notice and without undue interruption to
their respective businesses, access during normal business hours to their
respective books and records, Contracts, instruments, computer data and other
data and information solely to the extent pertaining to the operations, assets
and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date
for a period of four years following the Closing Date in so far as such access
is reasonably required by Seller or Buyer or their respective Representatives
in connection with preparation of financial statements (including historical
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Albertsons
banner business conducted by them) and SEC reporting obligations, satisfaction
of regulatory requirements, and other reasonable business purposes (
_provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the parties respective rights of
discovery) and provide such cooperation to the other party and its
Representatives in connection with the foregoing as may be reasonably
requested by the other party. The foregoing notwithstanding, subject to
Section 5.8, neither party shall be required to (i) afford such access if it
reasonably believes that affording such access would unreasonably disrupt its
operations, would cause a violation of any agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade
secret protection to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute
a violation of any applicable Law; or (ii) permit to perform any invasive
procedure with respect to any property of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws, Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of the
periodic management reports set forth on Section 5.2(d) of the Seller

financial officer pertaining to the operations, assets and liabilities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, promptly upon the preparation and internal
dissemination thereof.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_. Seller agrees that except as permitted by
Sections 5.03 and 6.03 of the Tender Offer Agreement, neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, and Seller and each of its Subsidiaries shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives and Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
Alternative Proposal (as defined in the Tender Offer Agreement) (including by
amending or granting any waiver or release under, or failing to enforce, any
standstill or similar contract with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to any class of equity securities of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to waive or
release any person from or fail to enforce any provision of such standstill or
contract prohibiting any person from communicating with the board of directors
of Seller); (b) participate in any negotiations regarding an Alternative
Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information regarding an Alternative
Proposal to, any person that has made or, to Sellers Knowledge, is
considering making an Alternative Proposal; (c) engage in discussions
regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person that has made an Alternative
Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions
of this Section 5.3; or (d) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in
principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.03 of the Tender Offer
Agreement).

 



 

Section 5.4 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall cause to be transferred from the
Company and its Subsidiaries to Seller or one of its Subsidiaries those
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are listed in Section
5.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, with such Section 5.4(a) to be updated
based on mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller on the fifteenth Business Day
prior to the Closing Date. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, subject
to approval by Buyer at least 15 days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be transferred (i) from the Company and its Subsidiaries to Seller or
one of its Subsidiaries those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
listed in Section 5.4(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and (ii) from
Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company) to the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries those employees who are listed in Section 5.4(a)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. Following the Closing, Buyer may request that
certain employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries performing services for Buyer
and its Subsidiaries under and pursuant to the Seller-ABS TSA and/or the
Seller-Company TSA be hired by Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company) (subject to agreement of Seller with respect to such employees not
providing legal services under the Seller-ABS TSA and/or the Seller-Company
TSA) not later than 90 days following the Closing Date (" _Offer Employees_ ")
and, in order to effect the hiring of such Offer Employees, Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall make a written Qualifying Offer
(as defined below) to each Offer Employee no later than 90 days following the
Closing Date (provided that each such Offer Employee remains employed through
the date of such offer), and, upon the acceptance of such an offer by an Offer
Employee, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall terminate the employment of such
Offer Employee within 5 Business Days of the Offer Employee accepting the
offer and such Offer Employee shall, upon termination of employment by Seller
and its Subsidiaries, immediately become employed by Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) (such Offer Employees who become so
employed by Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company), the " _Delayed
Hire Employees_ " and the date on which each such Offer Employee is so hired,
the " _Delayed Hire Date_ "). For the purposes of this Section 5.4(a), a
"Qualifying Offer" is an offer of immediate employment by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) that remains open for no more than 10
days to (A) an Offer Employee who is eligible to participate in Sellers
Executive and Officer Severance Pay Plan (the " _E andO Severance Plan_") which
provides for (x) total annual cash compensation (as such term is used in the
EandO Severance Plan) that is not less than the Offer Employees total annual
cash compensation immediately prior to the date that such offer of employment
is made, (y) other compensation and benefits on terms consistent with Section
5.4(b) and (z) a position that

 



      
 

 



 

does not require relocation and (B) an Offer Employee who is eligible to
participate in Sellers Severance Pay Plan for Nonunion Associates which
provides for (x) base pay that is no less than the base pay paid to such
employee immediately prior to the date of such employees termination of
employment, (y) other compensation and benefits on terms consistent with
Section 5.4(b) and (z) a position that does not require relocation. The intent
of Buyer and Seller is that each Delayed Hire Employee shall be treated
consistently with this Section 5.4 as if employed by the Company at the
Closing, as described further below. With respect to any Offer Employee who is
made an offer that is not a Qualifying Offer, the Company shall be required to
reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries for the actual costs of any severance
benefits payable under the EandO Severance Plan or Sellers Severance Pay Plan
for Nonunion Associates, as applicable, payable by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to any such terminated Offer Employee.

 



 

(b) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to those Company Closing Date Employees who are
not then subject to a collective bargaining agreement, as well as to Delayed
Hire Employees commencing as of the applicable Delayed Hire Date (each, a "
_Company Non-Union Employee_ ," and together, the " _Company Non-Union
Employees_ ") employee benefits that are, taken as a whole, substantially
similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer (without any obligation on the part of Buyer or the Company to maintain
the employment of any such person at any time following the Closing). In
addition, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall be
responsible for giving any notices that may be required under the WARN Act as
a result of employment terminations, layoffs or reductions in hours of work
imposed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Company) after the
Closing. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries from any and all liabilities asserted to be due under the WARN
Act in connection with that duty (to the extent any such duty exists). This
paragraph is not an admission by any party that notices are required under any
particular circumstances and does not give any rights of any kind to any
employee of Seller, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level and accrual of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company) providing benefits
to any Company Non-Union Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_
"), each Company Non-Union Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Non-Union Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Non-Union
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Non-Union
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces benefits under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Non-Union
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company
Non-Union Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be

 



      
 

 



 

waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of Seller or
its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



 

(d) As soon as practicable following the date hereof but no later than the
Effective Time, Seller shall transfer from the Company or its Subsidiaries to
Seller or any Non-Company Subsidiaries those employees (the " _Transferred
Union Employees_ "), whose employment is subject to any of the collective
bargaining agreements set forth on Section 5.4(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _Transferred Union Agreements_ "). Seller or any of its Non-
Company Subsidiaries shall assume responsibility for and comply with the
Transferred Union Agreements and will maintain the compensation and benefits
of the Transferred Union Employees to the extent required by the terms of the
Transferred Union Agreements. From and after the Effective Time, the Company
shall remain responsible for and comply with all collective bargaining
agreements, memorandums of understanding, or other labor agreements and
obligations (including agreements and obligations with respect to multi-
employer plans) which govern the terms and conditions of employment for any
current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than
the Transferred Union Agreements (the " _Union Agreements_ "), and will
maintain the compensation and benefits of those current and former employees
whose employment is subject to the Union Agreements (the " _Company Union
Employees_ ") to the extent required by the terms of the Union Agreements
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a limitation on the rights of
the parties to any Union Agreements or Transferred Union Agreements to amend
such agreement in a manner permitted by its terms or applicable Law. From and
after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer and/or the Company shall (in the ordinary
course or earlier if reasonably practicable) cause any amended, renewed or
modified Union Agreement to remove Seller and any Non-Company Subsidiaries
from such Union Agreements; and (ii) Seller shall (in the ordinary course or
earlier if reasonably practicable) cause any amended, renewed or modified
Transferred Union Agreement to remove Buyer and any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) from such Transferred Union Agreement. As between
Seller and Buyer, from and after the Effective Time, (i) Seller and the Non-
Company Subsidiaries shall cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising
from or in connection with any Union Agreements, and the Company shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, promptly reimburse and
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and the Non-Company Subsidiaries
with respect to all liabilities, costs and expenses in connection with any
Union Agreements and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease to have
any obligation whatsoever arising from or in connection with any Transferred
Union Agreements, and Seller shall promptly reimburse and indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Company with respect to all liabilities, costs and
expenses in connection with any Transferred Union Agreements.

 



 

(e) Seller shall, or shall cause any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries to,
assume all rights, liabilities and obligations arising from and after the
Effective Time in respect

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company Benefit Plans that are set forth in Section 5.4(e)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. Buyer shall, or shall cause any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) to, assume all rights, liabilities (except as set
forth in Section 5.4(e)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter) and obligations
arising from and after the Effective Time in respect of the Company Benefit
Plans that are set forth in Section 5.4(e)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

 



 

(f) (i) Each Company Closing Date Employee who was an active participant in
the STAR Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date shall participate in the
Buyer 401(k) Plan effective on the Closing Date, and each Delayed Hire
Employee who was an active participant in the STAR Plan immediately prior to
the Delayed Hire Date shall participant in the Buyer 401(k) Plan effective on
the Delayed Hire Date. Company Closing Date Employees and Delayed Hire
Employees shall not make or receive additional contributions under the STAR
Plan after the Closing Date or the applicable Delayed Hire Date, respectively,
unless any such person shall once again become employed by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date or the Delayed Hire Date,
respectively, and on or after such date such person otherwise becomes eligible
to participate in the STAR Plan. The interest of each Company Closing Date
Employee and Delayed Hire Employee in the STAR Plan attributable to employer
matching contributions as of the Closing Date or the applicable Delayed Hire
Date, as applicable, shall be 100% vested on such date.

 



 

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (as to Company
Closing Date Employees) or the Delayed Hire Date (as to Delayed Hire
Employees), but in no event later than six months following such applicable
date, Seller shall cause to be transferred from the trust under the STAR Plan
to the trust under the Buyer 401(k) Plan the aggregate amount that is credited
to the accounts of such persons as of the date of transfer, but not less than
or more than permitted by applicable law. The transfer shall be in cash
(except with respect to any participants loan notes or except as agreed
between the trustees for the STAR Plan and the Buyer 401(k) Plan) and shall
include the transfer of the aggregate assets held in the accounts relating to
each applicable person under the STAR Plan, including without limitation any
participant loan notes held under the STAR Plan. During the period between the
Closing Date and the date accounts are transferred pursuant to this Section
5.4(f)(ii), the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to process payroll
deductions from Company Closing Date Employees and Delayed Hire Employees for
the purpose of repaying such loans and shall either, as agreed by Buyer and
Seller, (A) hold such amounts in trust on behalf of the STAR Plan pending the
account transfer described in this paragraph, and transfer such amounts to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan in repayment of the applicable loans as soon as practicable
following such account transfer, or (B) transfer such amounts to the STAR
Plans trust as soon as practicable after being deducted from payroll in
repayment of the applicable loans.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
of this Section 5.4 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith or Union shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.4 shall be
deemed an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or construed to limit the
right of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

plan and any applicable collective bargaining agreement, nor shall anything in
this Section 5.4 be construed to require Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
retain the employment of any particular employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) With respect to any medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare
plan expenses or benefits provided pursuant to the Multiplier Welfare Plans
set forth in Section 3.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical,
life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for
each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims
incurred by such employees or their covered dependents prior to the Closing
Date (or, in the case of a Delayed Hire Employee, the applicable Delayed Hire
Date). All medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses
and benefits with respect to claims incurred by employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or their covered dependents on or after the Closing Date (or,
in the case of a Delayed Hire Employee, on or after the applicable Delayed
Hire Date) shall be the responsibility of the Company. For purposes of this
Section 5.4(h), a claim is deemed incurred when the services that the subject
of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death
occurs; and in the case of hospital stay, when the employee or their covered
dependent first enters the hospital. Seller will retain all claims and
obligations of employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who qualify for
short or long-term benefits pursuant to the terms of Sellers short-term
disability program or long-term disability program as of the Closing Date,
including all future income benefits and any other health and welfare
benefits, as provided under Sellers benefit plan rules and provisions while
the employee is on long term or short term disability.

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and the APA, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including any such matters
that may be necessary under or in connection with the APA or consummation of
the Albertsons Asset Purchase, the Specified Approvals and the Buyer

registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,

additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and the
Albertsons Asset Purchase on the terms set forth in the Transaction Documents
and the APA; _provided_ that in no event shall Seller, Buyer, the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to, at or after the
Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract other than as may be
required in connection with the Refinancing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller and Buyer shall each be required to pay at the Effective Time 50% of
any fees, penalties or other consideration that Seller, Buyer, the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries is legally required to pay to any third
party to obtain such partys consent to or approval of the Transactions and
the Albertsons Asset Purchase, such payment not to exceed $10,000,000 by each

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein and without limiting the
foregoing, Seller, the Company and Buyer shall (i) as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within ten Business Days after the date hereof) after the

HSR Act with respect to the Share Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act; (ii) use all reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third
parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (B) promptly making all such filings and timely
obtaining all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals; (iii)

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the

if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement
authorities or any other person may assert under any Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.5), shall require, or be construed to
require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to proffer to, or agree to, sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate and agree to sell, divest, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber
before or after the Closing, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interests therein of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or to consent to any sale,
divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their respective assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses, or interest therein
or to any agreement by any such person to take any of the foregoing actions)
or to agree to make any material changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Buyers or any of its
Affiliates ability to own or operate, of any such assets, licenses, product
lines, businesses or interests therein or Buyers or any of its Affiliates
ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends, or otherwise exercise full
ownership rights with respect to ownership interests in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in each case that would
be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and
neither Seller, the Company nor

 



      
 

 



 

any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall take (or agree to take) any such
action, to the extent applicable, except with Buyers prior written consent.

 



 

(c) Seller, the Company, and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other
in connection with the making of all registrations, filings, notifications,
communications, submissions, and any other material actions pursuant to this
Section 5.5, and subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions
of any Governmental Entity, Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised on a current basis of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Seller or the Company, on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be, or by any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third party or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Subject to applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information, Seller and the Company on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any
such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents
submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted by Seller or the Company (i) to remove proposals
from third parties with respect thereto; (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual agreements; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
or confidentiality concerns. Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, agree not to participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the proposed transactions unless they consult with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(d) Subject to the proviso in Section 5.5(b), if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the APA as violative of any Law,
Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of such
transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
Section 5.5.

 



 

(e) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, neither Seller nor Buyer and nor their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
not to, take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the parties from obtaining any Specified Approval, Buyer
Approval, or other approval, clearance or waiver from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions, or to prevent or delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" shall not
require (i) Buyer to (A) pay (or agree to pay) more for the Debt Financing
(whether in interest rate, fees or otherwise) than the terms set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letter entered into by Buyer in connection
therewith (including after giving effect to any increase in interest rate,
fees or otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions contained in such
fee letter) or, so long as Buyer has complied with Section 5.8, otherwise
agree to any alternative financing that is on terms or conditions materially
less favorable to Buyer and the Company, taken as a whole, than those in the
Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letter entered into by Buyer in connection
therewith (including after giving effect to any increase in interest rate or
fees or otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions contained in such
fee letter); (B) seek more capital than is committed in the Equity Commitment
Letters; or (C) waive any condition or agree to any changes to the Commitment
Letters; and (ii) Seller to (A) pay (or agree to pay) more for the Refinancing
(whether in interest rate, fees or otherwise) than the terms set forth in the
Refinancing Commitment Letters and any fee letter entered into by Seller in
connection therewith (including after giving effect to any increase in
interest rate, fees or otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions
contained in such fee letter) or, so long as Seller has complied with Section
5.9, otherwise agree to any alternative financing that is on terms or
conditions materially less favorable to Seller and its Non-Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (and until after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) to those in the Refinancing Commitment
Letters and any fee letter entered into by Seller in connection therewith
(including after giving effect to any increase in interest rate or fees or
otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions contained in such fee
letter); (B) waive any condition or agree to any changes to the Refinancing
Commitment Letters; or (C) consummate the Refinancing if after doing so Seller
would be in default under the Definitive Refinancing Agreements (without
prejudice to any rights of Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(h)).

 



 

(g) The Parties shall negotiate the forms, terms and conditions of the
agreements described in the term sheet set forth in the Section 5.5(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Lancaster/MRDC Agreements_ "), on the basis
of such term sheet, in good faith, with each such Lancaster Agreement to
incorporate usual and customary provisions for similar agreements in similar
circumstances. If a definitive Lancaster/MRDC Agreement cannot be finalized by
Closing, the Closing shall nevertheless occur (subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the other conditions contained herein). During the period following
the Closing Date until such Lancaster/MRDC Agreement is executed, the parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, operate the business
with respect to the subject matter of such Lancaster/MRDC Agreement on the
terms and conditions set forth in the term sheet attached to this Agreement.
The term sheet shall govern the parties rights and obligations with respect
to such subject matter until the respective Lancaster/MRDC Agreement has been
executed.

 



 

(h) The Parties shall work together in good faith to make commercially
reasonable transition/supply arrangements in respect of the matters set forth
in Section 5.5(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in addition to any
related transition services in respect thereof to be provided under the
Seller-Company TSA and the Seller-ABS TSA.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. Seller, the Company, and Buyer will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other

 



      
 

 



 

public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment
prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity; _provided_ that the
restrictions in this Section 5.6 shall not apply to any communication by
Seller permitted under Section 5.03 of the Tender Offer Agreement. Buyer,
Seller and the Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement in effect on the
date hereof and disclosed on Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, the Company shall maintain in
effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and
bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim.

 



 

(b) The Company and Buyer shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former
director, manager, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, manager, officer,
member, fiduciary or trustee of another corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, Company Benefit Plan or other trust,
pension or employee benefit plan (each, together with such persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
reasonable costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission by the
Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, manager,
or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or as a director, manager,
officer, member, fiduciary or trustee of another corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, Company Benefit Plan or other
trust, pension or employee benefit plan, whether occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in
connection with such Indemnified Partys service as an officer, director,
manager,

 



      
 

 



 

officer, member, fiduciary or trustee in any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action,
the Company shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

 



 

(c) Seller shall maintain directors and officers liability insurance
coverage, employment practices liability, and fiduciary liability (" _D andO
Insurance_"), with terms and limits consistent with the DandO Insurance in
effect as of the Closing Date, for the Company, directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries employed prior to the Closing for a period of six
years following the Closing with respect to post-Closing liabilities that
arise out of occurrences or alleged occurrences on or before the Closing.
Seller shall be solely responsible for the cost of such DandO Insurance and for
any and all deductibles under such DandO Insurance. At Sellers option, in lieu
of maintaining such DandO Insurance, Seller or the Company may purchase, prior
to the Closing, one or more six-year prepaid "tail" policies covering all
primary and excess DandO Insurance, with respect to matters that occurred or are
alleged to have occurred on or before the closing, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such "tail" prepaid policies have
been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, at no cost to Buyer, Buyer
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Company,
and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for
insurance hereunder. Buyer and the Company shall have the right to file claims
or cause claims to be filed and to collect insurance proceeds under such DandO
Insurance or such "tail" policies, as applicable. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer and the Company in filing and pursuing any such claim and
in collecting insurance proceeds under such DandO Insurance or such "tail"
policies, as applicable. All costs associated with the filing of claims and/or
the collection of insurance proceeds under the DandO Insurance Policies are
hereinafter referred to as the "DandO Insurance Claim Costs." The DandO Insurance
Claim Costs allocable to claims asserted against the Company shall be borne by
the Company, and the DandO Insurance Claims Costs allocable to claims asserted
against directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed
prior to the Closing shall be borne by Sellers.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification
arrangement, any corporate statute or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 5.7 shall survive the Closing and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(e) In the event Buyer or the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.8 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letters; (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") consistent with the
terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter); and (iii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions within its reasonable control in the Commitment
Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements and complying with its
obligations thereunder ( _provided_ that this clause (iii) shall not impair
the rights of Buyer pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of this Agreement). In
the event that all conditions contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of this
Agreement and in the Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt
Financing, the availability of the Cash Equity) have been satisfied, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Buyer Lenders and Equity
Investors to fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the APA and to pay related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date (including by using its reasonable best efforts
to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments and the Definitive
Financing Agreements). Buyer shall comply with its obligations, and enforce
its rights, under the Commitment Letters in a timely and diligent manner.
Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company: (A) permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under, or replace (including any replacement for any portion of the
Financing that becomes unavailable), the Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing; (2) reduces the
amount of the Financing; (3) adversely affects the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Financing Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, relative to the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against such
other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in
the Definitive Financing Agreements; or (4) would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the APA or otherwise adversely affect the ability or
likelihood of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the APA or make the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur; or (B) terminate any Commitment Letter;
_provided_ that Buyer shall have the right to consent to assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in connection with
the syndication of the Debt Financing as expressly contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters. Upon any such amendment, supplement or modification of the
Debt Financing Commitments or Equity Financing Commitment, as applicable, in
accordance with this Section 5.8(a), the term "Debt Financing Commitments"
shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments and the term "Equity Financing
Commitment" shall mean the Equity Financing Commitment, in each case, as so
amended, supplemented or modified. In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Buyer will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, and in any event prior to the End Date,
alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
remaining portion of the Debt Financing (if any) and the Cash Equity, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the APA and to
pay related fees and expenses) on terms not materially less favorable to Buyer
and the Company taken as a whole than those set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letter entered into by Buyer
in connection therewith (including after giving effect to any increase in
interest rate, fees or otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions
contained in such fee letter), and which do not include any conditions to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than
those in the Debt Commitment Letters and which do not contain any conditions
that, when considered with the other conditions taken as a whole, would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the
Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Buyer to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated by the this Agreement and the
APA or make the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less
likely to occur. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in
the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, but alternative facilities obtained in
accordance with this Section 5.8(a) are available on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or replacements thereof), then Buyer
shall cause the proceeds of such alternative financing to be used in lieu of
such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letters" and "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) or commitment with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing
Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question). Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt oral and written notice of (1) any material breach or
default by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreements of which Buyer becomes aware and (2) the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any Lender, Equity Investor, or
other financing source with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreements of any provision thereof. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Buyer or any Affiliate or any other
financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Buyers obligations
hereunder or affect Sellers termination rights under Section 7.1(g);
_provided_ that it is understood and agreed by Seller that Seller shall not
have the right to obtain specific performance to cause Buyer to consummate the
Closing except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 8.5.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall provide and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, employees,
consultants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives ("
_Representatives_ "), including legal and accounting, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing, including (i) furnishing Buyer and the Buyer Lenders as
promptly as practicable with such financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (including with respect to Sellers
Albertsons banner business) reasonably requested by Buyer or its Debt
Financing Sources (through Buyer) (and updates thereto, as reasonably
requested by such persons in order to satisfy any obligation to update
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters) to consummate the Debt Financing and
customary to be included in marketing materials for senior secured bank deals
or necessary to permit Buyer and its Debt Financing Sources to confirm
compliance of the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing with the terms of
the documents governing the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including, if applicable, computations relevant to any indentures related
thereto (all such

 



      
 

 



 

information in this clause (i), the " _Required Information_ "); _provided_
that the Required Information shall not include, and Buyer shall be
responsible for, any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired
to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the Debt
Financing); (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and
senior management, representatives or advisors, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, of the Company), presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt
Financing, and assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, prospective lender presentations, bank information memoranda
and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing; (iii)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents, legal opinions, surveys and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer as necessary and customary
for financings similar to the Debt Financing; (iv) using reasonable best
efforts to assist in the preparation of a customary confidential information
memorandum for the facilities and other customary marketing materials to be
used in connection with the syndications reasonably deemed necessary by the
lead arranger of the Debt Financing to complete a successful syndication
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters; (v) consulting with the
Buyer in connection with the negotiation of and executing such definitive
financing documents and agreements and such other customary documents
(including officers certificates) as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
provided no such document shall be operative until the Closing; (vi)
facilitating the pledging of collateral, provided that no pledge shall be
operative until the Closing; (vii) permitting the Debt Financing Sources to
evaluate and assess the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and determining collateral
values, to the extent customary and reasonable; (viii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain customary payoff letters and customary instruments of
discharge and termination of all Indebtedness and Liens, as reasonably
requested by Buyer, which shall not be operative until the Closing; (ix) using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the production of any due diligence
items that the Buyer Lenders may reasonably request, including existing Phase
I environmental site assessments, field audits, appraisals and title
insurance; and (x) at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
providing all documentation and other information about the Company as is
reasonably requested by the Buyer Lenders with respect to applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the
USA PATRIOT Act ( _provided_ that the request by Buyer for such information is
received by the Company at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date);
_provided_ , _in each case_ , that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any agreement that is not
contingent upon the Closing. The foregoing notwithstanding, (A) neither Seller
nor the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries nor any persons who
are directors of Seller or the Company shall be required to pass resolutions
or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing; (B)
no obligation of Seller or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Representatives undertaken or under any certificate, document or instrument
executed pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until the Closing; (C)
none of Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by
Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing; and (D)
neither Seller nor the Company nor their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be required to cooperate pursuant to this Section

 



      
 

 



 

5.8(b) in any manner that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller or the Company. Nothing contained in this Section 5.8(b)
or otherwise shall require Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing. Buyer and the Company, jointly and severally, shall, promptly upon
request by Seller or the Company, reimburse Seller or the Company, as
applicable, for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives
in connection with such cooperation and, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives for and against any and
all losses, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request
of Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by Seller, the Company
or the Companys Subsidiaries).

 



 

(c) If Seller at any point believes that it has delivered the Required
Information in accordance with Section 5.8(b), it may deliver to Buyer a
written notice to such effect, in which case Seller shall be deemed to have
delivered the Required Information unless Buyer shall notify the Seller, in a
reasonably detailed written notice provided to Seller within five Business
Days of Sellers notice, that information that constitutes Required
Information has not been delivered.

 



 

(d) All nonpublic or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 5.8 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Buyer shall be permitted to disclose such information
to the Debt Financing Sources, Equity Investors, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Financing subject
to their entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to
such information on terms, taken as a whole, that are no worse from the
perspective of Seller than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities). Seller and
the Company hereby consent to the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing and any "banner" or other logo
currently used by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Refinancing; NAI Guarantee and Lien Releases_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, the proceeds of the Refinancing and effect the NAI Guarantee and
Lien Releases on the terms and conditions described in the Refinancing
Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Refinancing
Commitment Letters; (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the
Refinancing (the " _Definitive Refinancing Agreements_ ") consistent with the
terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter); and (iii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions within its reasonable control in the Refinancing
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Refinancing Agreements and complying
with its obligations thereunder ( _provided_ that this clause (iii) shall not
impair the rights of Seller pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this
Agreement). In the event that all conditions contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.2
of this Agreement (other than with respect to the Refinancing and the NAI
Guarantee and Lien Releases) and in the Refinancing Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letters have been satisfied, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Refinancing Lenders to fund the Refinancing (including by using its
reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the Refinancing Financing
Commitments and the Definitive Refinancing Agreements). Seller shall comply
with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the Refinancing Commitment
Letters in a timely and diligent manner. Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Buyer: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or
any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, or replace (including
any replacement for any portion of the Refinancing that becomes unavailable),
the Refinancing Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to
the consummation of the Refinancing or the NAI Guarantee and Lien Releases;
(2) reduces the amount of the Refinancing; (3) adversely affects the ability
of Seller to enforce its rights against other parties to the Refinancing
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Refinancing Agreements as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of
Seller to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Refinancing
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive
Refinancing Agreements; or (4) would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Seller to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Refinancing and the NAI
Guarantee and Lien Releases less likely to occur; or (B) terminate any
Refinancing Commitment Letter; _provided_ that Seller shall have the right to
consent to assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the
terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Refinancing as expressly
contemplated by the Refinancing Commitment Letters. Upon any such amendment,
supplement or modification of the Refinancing Commitments in accordance with
this Section 5.9(a), the term "Refinancing Commitments" shall mean the
Refinancing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified. In the event
that any portion of the Refinancing becomes unavailable, regardless of the
reason therefor, Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, and in any
event prior to the End Date, alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with any remaining portion of the Refinancing,
to consummate the Refinancing) on terms not materially less favorable to
Seller and the Non-Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, than those set
forth in the Refinancing Commitment Letters and any fee letter entered into by
Seller in connection therewith (including after giving effect to any increase
in interest rate, fees or otherwise resulting from any lender flex provisions
contained in such fee letter), and which do not include any conditions to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous, than
those in the Refinancing Commitment Letters and which do not contain any
conditions that, when considered with the other conditions taken as a whole,
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of
the Refinancing or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Seller to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
make the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Refinancing and the
NAI Guarantee and Lien Releases less likely to occur. In furtherance of and
not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the
Refinancing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but
alternative facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 5.9(a) are
available on the terms and conditions described in the Refinancing Commitment
Letters (or replacements thereof), then Seller shall cause the proceeds of
such alternative financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Refinancing
as promptly as practicable. For the purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, the terms "Refinancing Commitment Letters" and "Refinancing
Commitments" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) or commitment with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Refinancing Commitment Letter and Refinancing
Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question). Seller
shall provide Buyer with prompt oral and written notice of (1) any material
breach or default by any party to any Refinancing Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Refinancing Agreements of which Seller becomes aware; and (2) the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Refinancing Lender or other financing source with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Refinancing Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Refinancing Agreements of any provision thereof.
Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of its efforts to consummate the Refinancing and the NAI Guarantee
and Lien Releases.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Company Assets and Company Liabilities; Further Assurances;
Subsequent Transfers_.

 



 

(a) _Specified Transfers and Assumptions_. Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller
shall, and shall cause the Non-Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer to the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries the assets set forth on Section 5.10(a)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to Seller or one or more
of the Non-Company Subsidiaries the assets set forth on Section 5.10(a)(ii) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, (iii) Seller shall, and shall cause the Non-
Company Subsidiaries to assume the liabilities set forth on Section
5.10(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and (iv) the Company shall, or
shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, assume the liabilities set
forth on Section 5.10(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) _Unaudited Balance Sheet_. Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets forth supporting schedules reconciling the balance sheet contained in the
Financial Statements to the unaudited balance sheet of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries (including NAI and its Subsidiaries) contained in the Sellers
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 19, 2012 (such
memorandum and schedules, together with the balance sheet contained in the
Financial Statements and the Financial Statement Procedures relating to such
balance sheet, the " _Deal Basis Balance Sheet_ ").

 



 

(c) _Agreed-Upon Procedures_. Section 5.10(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets forth agreed-upon procedures to be used to identify any assets or
liabilities where the allocation in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet to Seller or
the Company, as the case may be, is incorrect (the " _Agreed-Upon Procedures_
"). The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreed-Upon Procedures are
intended to be, and shall be applied and interpreted to be, consistent with
the procedures used to allocate assets and liabilities on the Deal Basis
Balance Sheet, as described in the memorandum contained within the Deal Basis
Balance Sheet. Following the date hereof, KPMG LLP (" _KPMG_ ") shall conduct
the Agreed-Upon Procedures and report the results thereof.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. If KPMGs report identifies any long-term assets (including
any current portions of such long-term assets) or any current assets of a type
not used to

 



      
 

 



 

determine Working Capital owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries of a type
reflected on the Deal Basis Balance Sheet that were not allocated to the
Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet , then the Company shall, and shall
cause any of its applicable Subsidiaries to, transfer and assign to the Seller
(or any of the Non-Company Subsidiaries designated by the Seller) each such
asset. If KPMGs report identifies any long-term liabilities (including the
current portions of such liabilities) or any current liabilities of a type not
used to determine Working Capital owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries of
a type reflected on the Deal Basis Balance Sheet that were not allocated to
the Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet the Seller shall assume and hold
the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any such liability. If KPMGs
report identifies any long-term assets (including any current portions of such
long-term assets ) or any current assets of a type not used to determine __
Working Capital owned by the Seller or any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries of
a type reflected on the Deal Basis Balance Sheet that were allocated to the
Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet, then, Seller shall, and shall cause
any applicable Non-Company Subsidiary to, transfer and assign to the Company
(or any of the Companys Subsidiaries designated by the Company) each such
asset. If KPMGs report identifies any long-term liabilities (including any
current portions of such long-term liabilities) or current liabilities of a
type not used to determine Working Capital owned by the Seller or any of its
Non-Company Subsidiaries of a type reflected on the Deal Basis Balance Sheet
that were allocated to the Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet, then, the
Company shall assume and the Company shall hold the Seller and its Non-Company
Subsidiaries harmless from any such liability. The parties shall cooperate in
good faith to promptly execute and deliver such further instruments and take
such other actions as the other parties hereto may reasonably request in order
to effectuate any and all transfers, assignments, assumptions, and holding
harmless contemplated by this Section 5.10(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no transfers, assignments, assumptions or other adjustments will be made under
this Section 5.10(d) unless (i) the absolute value of an amount equal to the
book value as of the Balance Sheet Date of (A) all long-term assets allocated
to Seller in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet and identified by KPMGs report as
being properly allocated to the Company, _plus_ (B) all long-term liabilities
allocated to the Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet and identified by
KPMGs report as being properly allocated to the Seller, _less_ (C) all long-
term assets allocated to the Company in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet and
identified by KPMGs report as being properly allocated to Seller, _less_ (D)
all long-term liabilities allocated to Seller in the Deal Basis Balance Sheet
and identified by KPMGs report as being properly allocated to the Company,
exceeds (ii) $10,000,000.

 



 

(e) _Current Item Adjustments_. If KPMGs report identifies any assets or
liabilities in the Balance Sheet of a type used to determine Working Capital
that were allocated to Seller in the Balance Sheet but that should have been
allocated to the Company, or that were allocated to the Company in the Balance
Sheet but that should have been allocated to Seller, KPMG shall calculate the
ratio of (i) Working Capital based upon the values in the Balance Sheet as
adjusted by giving effect to the correct allocations so identified and (ii)
$674,866,000 (the "Working Capital Ratio"). Following such determination, for
all purposes under this Agreement, the Target Minimum Working Capital shall be
equal to the amount set forth in the definition thereof multiplied by the
Working Capital Ratio, and the Target Maximum Working Capital shall be equal
to the amount set forth in the definition thereof multiplied by the Working
Capital Ratio.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Limitations on Agreed-Upon Procedures_. The parties agree and acknowledge
that the Agreed-Upon Procedures as performed by KPMG are intended only to
address the accuracy of the Deal Basis Balance Sheet as of the Balance Sheet
Date and not to update the Deal Basis Balance Sheet to any subsequent date.
The Agreed-Upon Procedures are not intended to result in, and KPMG shall not
make or identify in its report, any adjustments to the book or carrying value
of any asset or liability (as opposed to the allocation or existence of such
asset or liability).

 



 

(g) _Subsequent Assets and Liabilities._ If any assets (other than cash in
excess of the Minimum Cash, which will continue to be swept from the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries) or
liabilities are acquired or incurred or arise following the Balance Sheet Date
and prior to the Closing in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
then such assets or liabilities will be allocated in accordance with the
methodologies consistent with those used to prepare the Deal Basis Balance
Sheet as supplemented by any adjustments identified by KPMG after performing
the Agreed-Upon Procedures.

 



 

(h) _Further Assurances_. In furtherance of the foregoing, in the event and to
the extent that a transferring party is unable to obtain any consents required
to transfer and assign to the other party (or such other partys designated
Affiliate) any assets, and a release of a transferor from any liabilities to
be assigned, transferred or assumed pursuant to this Section 5.10, such
transferor (1) shall continue to be bound by any such liabilities pending
assignment or transfer to, or assumption by, the other party or its designated
Affiliate, (2) shall, at the direction and expense of the other party, pay,
perform and discharge fully all of its obligations under such liabilities from
and after the Closing and prior to assignment to the other party or its
designated Affiliate, and (3) shall, to the extent legally permissible,
provide to the other party the benefits of ownership and use of any such
assets, and the other party will indemnify the transferor for any liabilities
of the transferor arising out of such assets or its compliance with the
documentation and agreement relating to, any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
associated with any attempt to transfer or failure to transfer such asset or
any liabilities arising out of or resulting from the transferors actions
taken in accordance with any such directions of the other party or its
designated Affiliate. Following the Closing, the transferor shall exercise or
exploit its rights and options under all such assets when and only as
reasonably directed by, and at the expense of, the other party or its
designated Affiliate. If and when any such consent shall be obtained or such
asset or liability shall otherwise become assignable, the transferor shall
promptly assign all its rights and obligations thereunder to the other party
or its designated Affiliate without payment of further consideration and the
other party or its designated Affiliate shall, without the payment of any
further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arrangement described in this Section
5.10(h) is impracticable or will cause (or is likely to cause) a default under
any real estate lease, then the parties will work in good faith to establish a
mutually satisfactory arrangement for the operation of such leased real
property during the period subsequent to the Closing and pending receipt of
the required consent, including a fair and equitable arrangement (under the
applicable circumstances) for allocating income and expenses with respect to
such property during such period.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.11 _Escrow Agreement; Supplemental Indenture; Buyer and ASC
Restrictions_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, substantially contemporaneously with the consummation
of the Albertsons Asset Purchase, (i) Buyer shall cause ASC to enter into an
escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex J-1 with
Seller and JPMorgan N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") and (ii) Buyer shall cause
ASC to deposit $467,000,000 in cash (the " _Escrow Deposit_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into a securities account established
at the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "). Any release of the Escrow
Deposit (and any proceeds thereof) from the Escrow Account shall be governed
exclusively by the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause ASC to enter into a supplemental
indenture to the ASC Indenture substantially in the form attached hereto as
Annex J-2 (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") providing that ASC shall not be
entitled to issue additional securities under the ASC Indenture without the
prior written consent of Seller until those certain Guarantees, dated as of
July 6, 2005, pursuant to which Seller has agreed to guarantee the obligations
of ASC under the ASC Indenture and the Existing ASC Notes (the " _Seller
Guarantee_ ") shall have been released or terminated. Buyer shall cause ASC to
make Seller a third-party beneficiary of the Supplemental Indenture and Seller
shall be entitled to seek specific performance thereof in addition to all
other remedies available to Seller in respect of any breach of the
Supplemental Indenture by ASC.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date Buyer shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law defend and hold harmless Seller against any
Losses, costs and expenses in connection with any Action arising out of,
relating to or in connection with, or any liability incurred by Seller under,
the Seller Guarantee.

 



 

(d) Until such time as either (i) all of the Existing ASC Notes have been
repaid or repurchased or (ii) there is on deposit in the Escrow Account and/or
a separate escrow account established on substantially similar terms for the
benefit of the Trustee (as defined in the ASC Indenture) and Seller an amount
sufficient to pay the entire principal amount of the then-outstanding Existing
ASC Notes and three years interest thereon, then Buyer shall not make any
cash or non-cash distributions (other than distributions in respect of Taxes)
to its members unless after giving effect to any such distribution Buyer
(excluding any cash held at any of its Subsidiaries) shall possess
unencumbered cash of not less than $150,000,000.

 



 

(e) Following the Debt Financing, Buyer shall, and shall cause ASC to, not
incur any additional Indebtedness for borrowed money so long as either (i) the
Existing ASC Notes are outstanding or (ii) the Seller Guarantee shall not have
been released or terminated; _provided_ that ASC may cash collateralize Credit
Support Instruments in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(f) Until such time as Buyer (excluding any cash held at any of its
Subsidiaries) shall possess unencumbered cash of not less than $150,000,000,
Buyer shall (i) continue to own directly or indirectly all of the outstanding
equity interests of the Company and Albertsons Holdings LLC and (ii) cause
Albertsons Holdings LLC to continue to own directly or indirectly all of the
outstanding equity interest of ABS.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.12 _Albertson s Asset Purchase_. On the Closing Date, immediately
following the consummation of the Share Purchase, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Company to, consummate the Albertsons Asset Purchase substantially on the
terms set forth (and in no event materially less favorable to Seller than
those set forth) in the APA. Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.5,
from and after the date hereof, Seller and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide to Buyer all assistance reasonably requested by Buyer
in the preparation for the consummation of the Albertsons Asset Purchase.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Enterprise-Level Contracts_. For any Contract (a) between Seller
or any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party, on
the other hand; or (b) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party, on the other hand, in each case, pursuant to
which both Seller or its Non-Company Subsidiaries and the Company or its
Subsidiaries receive goods or services, to the extent that such Contract would
not permit Seller or its applicable Subsidiary, or the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary, respectively, to continue to provide such goods or
services to the other party from and after the Closing pursuant to the Seller-
Company TSA or the Seller-ABS TSA, Buyer and Seller shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such Contract to be bifurcated, including as
set forth on Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, effective as of the
Closing such that each of Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to receive the benefits (including
any pricing or discounts) and bear the liabilities of such Contract to the
same extent received and borne prior to the Closing. To the extent that a
third party requires payment of any additional fees or costs or requires the
repayment of any funds or obligations in order to effect the bifurcation of
any such Contract, if Seller (or the Non-Company Subsidiaries) receive the
majority of the goods, services or intellectual property under such Contract,
then Seller shall be responsible for such payments and if the Company (or its
Subsidiaries) receive the majority of the goods, services or intellectual
property under such Contract, then Buyer shall be responsible for such
payments. To the extent that such bifurcation is not effected as of the
Closing, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which each party would, in compliance
with applicable Law, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear
the economic burdens associated with the applicable agreement that they would
have obtained, assumed and borne had such bifurcation been in effect.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Credit Support Instruments_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Non-Company Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to replace or cause one of its Non-Company
Subsidiaries to replace, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and effective as of the Closing Date, in respect
of all obligations of the Company and any such Subsidiary as obligor under any
Credit Support Instruments obtained or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Seller and its Non-Company
Subsidiaries (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be released from any
such obligations) (the " _Seller Credit Support Instruments_ "), including
those Seller Credit Support Instruments set forth in Section 3.23 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. To the extent such substitution contemplated by the
first sentence of this Section 5.14(a) has been effected, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall from and after the Closing cease to have any obligation
whatsoever arising from or in connection with the Seller Credit Support
Instruments, as applicable. To the extent such substitution contemplated by
the

 



      
 

 



 

first sentence of this Section 5.14(a) in respect of the Seller Credit Support
Instruments has not been effected on the Closing Date, Seller shall (x) use
commercially reasonable efforts to affect such substitution as soon as
practicable following the Closing, but in any event within six months thereof,
and (y) promptly reimburse and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to all costs and expenses in connection with
any such Seller Credit Support Instruments.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to replace, Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law and effective as of the Closing Date, in
respect of all obligations of Seller and any such Non-Company Subsidiary as
obligor under any other Credit Support Instruments obtained or entered into by
Seller or any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (and Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries shall be
released from any such obligations) (the " _Company Credit Support
Instruments_ "), including those Company Credit Support Instruments that are
set forth in Section 3.23 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. To the extent such
substitution contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 5.14(b) has
been effected, Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries shall from and after
the Closing cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising from or in
connection with the Company Credit Support Instruments, as applicable. To the
extent such substitution contemplated by the first sentence of this Section
5.14(b) in respect of the Company Credit Support Instruments has not been
effected, the Company shall (x) use commercially reasonable efforts to affect
such substitution as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in any
event within six months thereof, and (y) promptly reimburse and indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Non-Company Subsidiaries with respect
to any such Company Credit Support Instruments.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Credit Support Instrument is for the benefit of both
of the Company (or a Company Subsidiary) and the Seller (or a Non-Company
Subsidiary) (the " _Shared Credit Support Instruments_ "), Seller and the
Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause each such
Shared Credit Support Instrument to be cancelled and rewritten to reflect the
amount of business or claims supported thereby of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Non-Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing. Prior to such cancellation and rewriting, any costs and expenses
in connection with any such Shared Credit Support Instrument shall be
allocated between the Seller and the Company based on their respective amounts
of business or claims supported thereby. To the extent such cancellation and
rewriting contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 5.14(c) in
respect of the Shared Credit Support Instruments has not been effected, (x)
each of the Company and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such substitution as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in
any event within six months thereof, (y) the Company shall promptly reimburse
and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller (and the Non-Company
Subsidiaries) with respect to any obligations of Seller or any Non-Company
Subsidiary under such Shared Credit Support Instruments arising out of an
underlying claim that is primarily related to the Company, and (z) Seller
shall promptly reimburse and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company
(and its Subsidiaries) with respect to any obligations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under such Shared Credit Support Instruments arising out
of an underlying claim that is primarily related to Seller.

directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries designated by Buyer and to take
such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

thereof for any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code) or combined, consolidated, unitary or other similar group under state or
local law (each, an " _Affiliated Group_ ") of which the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof is or was a member prior to the Closing Date (including any
liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar state,
local or foreign Tax provision), including any Taxes allocated to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 5.17(b); (B) Transfer Taxes for which
the Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 5.17(c); (C) any and all Taxes
that may be imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary thereof as a result of

under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar state, local or
foreign Tax provision); and (D) Taxes that may be imposed on any Buyer Tax
Indemnitee as a result of the breach by Seller of its covenant set forth in
Section 5.17(h)(ii); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be
responsible for any Taxes (or fees or expenses incurred in connection
therewith) (x) imposed as a result of the Albertsons Asset Purchase or any
action taken or transaction effected by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company outside of the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing or (y) to the extent a liability, accrual or reserve for such
Taxes is reflected in Final Closing Date Working Capital.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Buyer and the Company, jointly and severally, shall be responsible for,
pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and hold each of
them harmless from and against (A) any and all Taxes (other than Transfer
Taxes but solely to the extent such Transfer Taxes are allocated pursuant to
Section 5.17(c), liability for which Transfer Taxes will be governed by such
Section (including reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith) with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Affiliated Group of which the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof is a member after the Closing Date, including any Taxes
allocated to a Post-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 5.17(b); (B) Taxes
imposed as a result of the Albertsons Asset Purchase or any action taken or
transaction effected by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company outside

breach by the Buyer of its covenant contained in Section 5.17(b)(ii)(x) (it
being agreed that, in the event Buyer breaches its covenant in Section
5.17(b)(ii)(x) of this Agreement and such breach results in the utilization of
losses of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), Taxes imposed as a result of such transactions shall be deemed
to equal the product of (x) the amount of the loss utilized and (y) 40%).

 



 

(iii) The indemnity and payment obligations set forth in this Section 5.17(a)
(and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.8) shall
survive until the date that is 30 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (including any extension thereof);
_provided_ that the right to indemnification with respect to claims of which
notice was given prior to the expiration of the survival period shall survive
such expiration until such claim is finally resolved and any obligations with
respect thereto are fully satisfied.

 



 

(b) _Allocations_.

 



 

(i) If, for any state, local or foreign Tax purposes, any Taxable period of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (any such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), except as provided in
Section 5.17(b)(ii), Taxes, if any, attributable to such Straddle Period shall
be allocated as follows:

 



 

(1) All real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations (other than Transfer Taxes described in Section 5.17(c)) ("
_Property Taxes_ ") levied with respect to the assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on the number of days
of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number
of days of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period; and

 



 

(2) Taxes (other than Property Taxes and Transfer Taxes described in Section
5.17(c)), if any, with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Tax Period on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the
Closing Date. Exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on
a daily basis.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer and Seller shall
report or cause to be reported (x) the Albertsons Asset Purchase and any
action taken or transaction effected by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company outside of the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing as occurring on the day after the Closing Date pursuant to U.S.
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(B) or any similar or analogous
provision of state, local or foreign Law (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
Taxes, if any, with respect to the Albertsons Asset Purchase shall be
allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period) and (y) the sale of Shares hereunder
as a sale of stock of the Company for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes; Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) All excise, sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains, transaction
privilege tax and similar Taxes (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed
on the purchase and sale of Shares by Seller to Buyer under Section 1.1 or on
the transactions undertaken pursuant to Section 5.10 of this Agreement shall
be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in order to limit the amount
of such Transfer Taxes, as permitted by applicable Law. Any Tax Return
required to be filed with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the
party responsible for such filing under applicable Law; provided that Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, shall pay to the party responsible for filing such
Tax Return the portion of any Transfer Tax due in respect of such filing for
which Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, is responsible under this Section
5.17(c) within 10 days of receipt of written notice specifying in reasonable
detail such amount (but no earlier than one Business Day before such Tax
Return is due). Any Transfer Taxes imposed on the Albertsons Asset Purchase
shall be borne exclusively by Buyer.

 



 

(ii) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns._ From and after the Closing
Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Returns of an Affiliated
Group for any taxable period of such Affiliated Group during which the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company is a member (a " _Combined Return_ "). Seller
shall timely file or cause to be timely filed any such Combined Return and
shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Combined Return, provided that Buyer
shall pay Seller an amount equal to such Taxes, if any, for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 5.17(a)(ii) in connection with such Combined
Return within 10 days of receipt of written notice specifying in reasonable
detail such amount (but no earlier than one Business Day prior to the due date
for the payment of such Taxes). Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
any other Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary, provided that (A)
Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to such Taxes, if any, for which Seller
is responsible pursuant to Section 5.17(a)(i) in connection with any such Tax
Return within 10 days of receipt of written notice specifying in reasonable
detail such amount (but no earlier than one Business Day prior to the due date
for payment of such Taxes), (B) Buyer shall deliver such Tax Returns for any
taxable period of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that is a Pre-
Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Period or a Straddle Period to Seller for Sellers review, comment and
approval no later than 20 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns and Buyer shall not file any such Tax Returns (or amend any such Tax
Returns previously filed) without the prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(d) _Cooperation and_ _Exchange_ _of Information_. The parties and their
respective Subsidiaries shall provide each other with such cooperation and
shall deliver each other such information and data and make available such
knowledgeable employees as the parties may reasonably request in order to
complete and file all Tax Returns which they may be required to file, to
respond to audits by any Tax authorities, and to otherwise enable them or
their Affiliates to satisfy their respective accounting and Tax obligations.
Each party shall make its employees and facilities available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide an explanation of any documents or information
provided hereunder. For a period of eight years after the Closing Date, the
parties shall retain all Tax Returns, books and records of, or with respect
to, the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date to the extent such items are in such persons
possession after the Closing. Thereafter, neither the parties nor their
Affiliates shall dispose of any such Tax Returns, books or records unless it
first offers such Tax Returns, books and records to the other party and such
other party fails to accept such offer within 60 days of the date it has been
made.

 



 

(e) _Tax_ _Proceedings_.

 



 

(i) Buyer and Seller shall each provide prompt notice to the other party of
any claim, assessment or dispute of which it becomes aware related to Taxes
that, if pursued successfully, would reasonably be expected to serve as a
basis for a claim for indemnification under Section 5.17(a) or that the other
party is otherwise entitled to control pursuant to this Section 5.17(e) (a "
_Tax Claim_ "). Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail any asserted
Tax liability relating to such Tax Claim and shall be accompanied by copies of
any notice and other documents received from any Tax authority in respect of
any such Tax Claim.

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Tax audit, contest, litigation, defense or other
proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") to the extent relating to Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period, the Controlling Party shall have the sole right to control,
contest, resolve and defend such Tax Proceeding (including the right to
determine whether and when to settle the Tax Proceeding); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, (A) the Controlling Party shall promptly notify the Non-
Controlling Party of such Tax Proceeding and provide the Non-Controlling Party
with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax
Proceeding; (B) the Controlling Party shall promptly deliver to the Non-
Controlling Party copies of all correspondence and documents related to such
Tax Proceeding; (C) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-
Controlling Party before taking any material action in connection with such
Tax Proceeding; (D) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-
Controlling Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to
comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; (E) the Controlling Party shall defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party
in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and (F) the Controlling
Party shall not settle such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Non-Controlling Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided,_ _further_ that, in the case of any Tax Proceeding in respect of
any taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that ends on or
prior to the Closing Date, the foregoing proviso shall apply only if (x) the
outcome of such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to defer the
inclusion of any item of income to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company from any Pre-Closing Tax Period to any Post-Closing Tax Period or
accelerate any item of deduction of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company from any Post-Closing Tax Period to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in
each case, other than as a result of any computational errors, and (y) such
deferral or acceleration, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to
result in a material increase in liability for Taxes of any Buyer Tax
Indemnitee with respect to which such Buyer Tax Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Controlling Party_ " means (i) in the case of any Tax Proceeding in respect
of a taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, or in respect
of any Combined Return for any taxable period, the Seller, and (ii) in the
case of any other Tax Proceeding (other than in respect of a taxable period
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date or in respect of any Combined Tax
Return for any taxable period), Seller if Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, or Buyer if Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing) are reasonably expected to bear the
greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and " _Non-
Controlling Party_ " means whichever of the Seller or Buyer is not the
Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

 



 

(f) _Certain Tax_ _Benefits_ _, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

 



 

(i) If Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) actually recognizes a Net Tax Benefit as a
result of any audit adjustment or adjustment pursuant to any Tax Proceeding
made with respect to any Tax item by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Taxes for which Seller is responsible under Section 5.17(a)(i) and for which
Seller has actually indemnified Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of
such Net Tax Benefit within 20 days of filing the Tax Return in which such Net
Tax Benefit was actually realized. " _Net Tax Benefit_ " means (A) an actual
reduction in Tax payable by Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), such reduction to be determined by
comparing the Tax liability incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) taking into account the
adjustment resulting from such audit or Tax Proceeding to the Tax liability
that would have been incurred in the absence of such adjustment, less (B) any
out-of-pocket cost incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to determine the amount
of such reduction, less (C) any actual net increase in Tax for the Post-
Closing Tax Period payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) as a result of (1) the breach
or inaccuracy of any representation set forth in Section 3.13; or (2) the
occurrence of the adjustment or the receipt or accrual of an indemnity payment
in respect of such adjustment, in each case, such increase to be determined by
comparing the Tax incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) taking into account all Tax items
resulting from such breach or inaccuracy or the occurrence of the adjustment
or the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment with the Tax that would
have been incurred in the absence of such breach or inaccuracy or occurrence.
To the extent that any Net Tax Benefit with respect to which Buyer has made a
payment to Seller under

 



      
 

 



 

this Section 5.17(f)(ii) is later lost (or increased) for any reason, Seller
shall repay to Buyer (or Buyer shall pay to Seller) the amount so lost (or the
amount of such increase) within 20 days after Buyers delivery of notice to
Seller specifying in reasonable detail the amount so lost (or within 20 days
after recognition of such increase).

 



 

(ii) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds of any Taxes for which the Seller
is responsible under Section 5.17(a)(i) and any refunds to which Seller is
entitled under Section 5.17(f)(i). Buyer shall be entitled to any refunds of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other than refunds to which the
Seller is entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Each party shall pay or
cause to be paid to the party entitled to a refund of Taxes under this Section
5.17(f)(ii) the amount of such refund (including any interest paid thereon and
net of any Taxes to the party receiving such refund in respect of the receipt
or accrual of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within twenty
(20) days of the actual receipt of the refund or the application of such
refund against amounts otherwise payable.

 



 

(g) _Tax_ _Treatment_ _of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required
under applicable Law, Seller, Buyer, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this
Section 5.17 and Section 2.1 as an adjustment to the purchase price or
contribution, as applicable, for Tax purposes.

 



 

(h) _Elections and Certain Other Tax Matters_. (i) Buyer shall not (A) make or
cause to be made any election under Section 338 of the Code in respect of the
acquisition of Shares or any other transaction contemplated hereunder or (B)
make or cause to be made any election under Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3 or take any other action that would change the classification for
federal income tax purposes of the Company or any Subsidiary or take any
action that would cause the sale of Shares hereunder to be treated as other
than a sale of stock of the Company for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6) and -36(e)(5) to the extent necessary to avoid any reduction
in the amount of the Companys tax attributes for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(iii) Except to the extent otherwise required by a determination within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or requested by Seller, Buyer shall
treat, and shall cause its Affiliates to treat, any LLC Conversion as a
liquidation within the meaning of Section 332 of the Code or a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, as determined by Seller. " _LLC
Conversion_ " shall mean a transaction, permitted under the last sentence of
Section 5.1(c), pursuant to which an entity ceases to be classified as an
"association" for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Non-Company
Subsidiaries for all economic loss (other than Taxes and Tax attributes) from
actions required by Section 5.17(h)(ii) or permitted by the last sentence of
Section 5.1(c); _provided_ that there should be no duplication to the extent
such items were already covered by the working capital adjustment; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that accountants and counsel fees and expenses
incurred in connection with such actions shall not be subject to
indemnification by Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.18 _Intercompany Accounts_. Effective no later than the Closing
Date, except as set forth in Section 5.18 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, all
intercompany receivables, payables, loans and investments then existing
between Seller or any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries (all of which will be
deemed to be receivables, payables, loans and investments of the Seller), on
the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries (all of which will be
deemed to be receivables, payables, loans and investments of the Company), on
the other hand, shall be netted to result in either a receivable of the
Company from Seller or a receivable of Seller from the Company. Such
receivable shall, as of the Closing, be contributed by Seller to the Company
(in the case of a receivable to Seller from the Company) or distributed by the
Company to Seller (in the case of a receivable to the Company from Seller),
such that, as of the Closing, there are no such intercompany accounts
outstanding between Seller and any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Litigation Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) In the event and for so long as Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries actively
is contesting or defending against any action, investigation, charge, claim,
or demand by a third party in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated
under this Agreement or the APA or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction arising prior to the Effective Time and
involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller will make available its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all
at the sole cost and expense of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) In the event and for so long as Seller or any of its Subsidiaries actively
is contesting or defending against any action, investigation, charge, claim,
or demand by a third party in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated
under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction arising prior to the Effective Time and
involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer will reasonably cooperate
with Seller and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all
at the sole cost and expense of Seller or its Non-Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other to divide any other
matters that arise between signing and closing to ensure that Buyer is
responsible for handling matters that primarily originate at the Company or
its Subsidiaries and Seller is responsible for handling matters that primarily
originate at the Seller or the Non-Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Certain Insurance Proceeds, Rights to Indemnification and
Claims_. With respect to each liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that arises out of occurrences, events or liabilities that predate the Closing
and has not been funded or assumed by Seller or the Non-Company Subsidiaries,
the Company and its Subsidiaries (and from and after the consummation of the
Albertsons Asset Purchase, Buyer) shall have the right to receive proceeds,
if any, recovered after the Closing in respect of such liability by the Seller
and the non-Company Subsidiaries from any other person under any insurance
policy, pool or program (other than with respect to business interruptions),
or any indemnity or right of recovery or setoff against a

 



      
 

 



 

supplier for defects in merchandise for resale (the " _Pre-Closing Insurance
Proceeds and Claims_ "). Following the Closing, Seller will cooperate with
Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing any insurance claims and in
the collection of insurance proceeds for such Pre-Closing Insurance Proceeds
and Claims. In the event that Seller incurs costs in assisting Buyer or the
Company, the Buyer or the Company shall reimburse, upon the request of Seller,
Seller and the Non-Company Subsidiaries for (and Seller may set off) all
reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller of the
Non-Company Subsidiaries, including costs of filing a claim, arbitration
costs, any deductibles and retentions attributable to such claims. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement and without limitation the rights set
forth in Section 5.7, all rights of the Buyer and the Company to Pre-Closing
Insurance Proceeds and Claims are subject to the terms, conditions and rights
of the insurance policies, pools or programs, or indemnities or rights of
recovery or setoff. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Buyers rights
hereunder, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no right to be
directly insured by any insurance policy, pool or program of Seller or any
Non-Company Subsidiary following the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Use of Names_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, except as provided in the Cross-License
Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.21(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, Seller and each of its Non-Company Subsidiaries shall cease using any
trademarks of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the name
"Albertsons" and all other marks and domain names set forth in Section
3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (or any variations, derivations or
combinations of the foregoing) in connection with the operation of their
respective businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in
the Cross-License Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.21(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer hereby grants to Seller and its Non-Company
Subsidiaries a limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-
assignable license to use the names set forth in Section 3.15(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter during the 180-day period commencing on the Closing
Date for the sole purpose of facilitating the wind-down of Sellers and each
of its Non-Company Subsidiaries use of such names in connection with their
respective businesses. After the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall represent that it has authority to bind the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, except as provided in the Cross-License
Agreement, Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries shall cease using any trademarks
of Seller or any of its Non-Company Subsidiaries, including the name
"SUPERVALU" and all other marks and domain names set forth in Section 5.21(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (or any variations, derivations or
combinations of the foregoing) in connection with the operation of their

Licenses for use in the same manner and to the same extent such Common Carrier
FCC Licenses were used by such assignor immediately prior to the assignment
thereof to the Communications Subsidiary. In the event of a _pro forma_
transfer of control of USSC, if applicable, as contemplated herein, within
five Business Days after the date of receipt of FCC approval for such
transaction, Seller shall take all action necessary to consummate the
transaction.

FCC (the " _FCC Applications_ ") to permit, at the Buyers option, either the
Common Carrier FCC Licenses or the equity interests of the Communications
Subsidiary or USSC, as applicable, to be transferred to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to

the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Buyer or
its designated Affiliate, on or prior to the Closing Date, either (i) the

permitted by applicable Law, and (ii) use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) preserve the Communications Subsidiary, (B) hold and operate

operate USSC in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 



 

(f) At the request of Buyer and as necessary to facilitate the Change in
Control FCC Approval, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions necessary to cease all common carrier services to the public,

Seller shall promptly notify Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly notify the
Seller, in writing after obtaining actual knowledge of any event, condition,

partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or
Section 7.1(e), as applicable; _provided_ that a party shall not be in breach
of this Section 5.24 if, reasonably promptly after obtaining actual knowledge

condition, fact or circumstance was not reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions to Closing not to be satisfied or give rise to the other
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or
Section 7.1(e), as applicable (even if such event, condition, fact or
circumstance ultimately results in a condition to Closing not being satisfied

entitled at Law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that Seller shall be entitled to seek and obtain
a decree or order of specific performance to cause Buyer to draw down the full
proceeds of the Cash Equity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letters and to consummate the Share Purchase only if (i) all
conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c) or that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions); (ii) the Debt Financing (or
alternative financing in accordance with Section 5.8) has been funded or will
be funded at the closing of the Albertsons Asset Purchase upon delivery of a

performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity;
and (ii) no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
