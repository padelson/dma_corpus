Alternative Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Seller or any of
its Affiliates and (iii) such other details of any such Alternative Proposal

Buyer reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change
to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal.

---|---|--- 



     | d. | Seller hereby confirms that, if the Principal Closing Date
occurred on the date hereof, the conditions set forth in Section 5.01(a) of
the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement would be satisfied, and Seller
hereby agrees to not take any action prior to the earlier of (x) the Offer
Acceptance and (y) the Offer Termination Time which would cause such condition
to not be satisfied. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8. | _Termination_. This Offer may be terminated: 
---|--- 



     | a. | by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; or 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | by Buyer, by written notice to Seller (such notice to be
delivered in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 11.07
of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement), at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance, if Seller shall have breached in any material respect any
of Sellers covenants or agreements contained in clause (a) of paragraph 5;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate this Offer pursuant
to this clause (b) if at the time of termination Buyer is not in material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Offer. 
---|---|--- 



   9. | _Termination Fees_. 
---|--- 



     | a. |

If (i) this Offer is terminated by Buyer pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph 8
or (ii) (A) any Person shall have made an Alternative Proposal after the date
hereof but prior to the Offer Termination Time, (B) Seller fails to deliver
the Offer Acceptance by the Offer Termination Time and (C) within twelve (12)
months after the Offer Termination Time, Seller or any of its Affiliates
shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Alternative
Proposal or shall have consummated a transaction contemplated by any
Alternative Proposal, then, in each of the cases of clause (i) or (ii),
Seller shall pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
a bank account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to four percent
(4.0%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to clause (i) shall be made no later than five (5)
Business Days following the termination of this Offer by Buyer, and payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to clause (ii) shall be made no later than five
(5) Business Days following the earlier of the date on which Seller or its
Affiliate executes the definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative
Proposal or the date on which Seller or its Affiliate consummates any
transaction contemplated by any Alternative Proposal. In 

---|---|--- Reimbursement payment to Buyer pursuant to paragraph 9(b) below, then the
amount of any Termination Fee shall be reduced by the amount of such Expense
Reimbursement payment. 
---|--- 



     | b. | If the Offer Acceptance has not been made for any reason
prior to the Offer Termination Time, Seller shall promptly (but in any event
not more than five (5) Business Days following the Offer Termination
Time) pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount of cash in respect of
Buyers expenses equal to one percent (1.0%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this paragraph 9 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Offer, and that, without these agreements, neither Seller
nor Buyer would have entered into this Offer. Accordingly, if Seller fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this paragraph 9, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Buyer commences any action which results in an award of,
or a judgment against Seller for, the Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement (or any portion thereof), Seller shall pay Buyers reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
enforcement) in connection with such action. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that this Offer terminates because the Consultation Processes shall have not
concluded by the Offer Termination Time, Buyer has materially breached
its obligations with respect to the Consultation Processes pursuant to clause
(b) of paragraph 7 of the failure of Consultation Process, and such breach was
the proximate cause of the failure of the Consultation Processes to conclude
by the Offer Termination Time (and Seller shall have complied with its
obligations with respect to such Consultation Processes), then Buyer shall not
be entitled to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to clause (ii) of
paragraph 9(a) or the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 9(b). 
---|---|--- 



   10. | _Date of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement; Anti-Trust
Filings_. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that, upon acceptance of the Offer and
the execution and delivery of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement
by Seller, (x) the date of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement as used
therein shall be deemed to be the date hereof and (y) the Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement shall be treated for all purposes as if executed and
delivered by Buyer and Seller on the date hereof, notwithstanding the
execution and delivery thereof by Seller at a later date. Buyer and Seller
hereby agree, as permitted by applicable Law, to commence the filing and
obtaining of consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Entities and other third parties as set forth in Section 6.06
of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof. 
---|---

governed by the law of the State of New York without reference to any
provisions thereof that would require the application of the laws of any
other jurisdiction. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising from or related
in any way to this Offer or the interpretation, application, breach,
termination or validity thereof, including any claim of inducement of this
Offer by fraud or otherwise, will be subject to the provisions of Section
11.12 of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12. | _Incorporation by Reference_. Sections 11.04 through 11.15 of
the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference
into this Offer, the terms of which shall apply to this Offer,
_mutatis mutandis_ , as though set forth herein, with references to "this

Seller shall not be under any obligation to sell or transfer to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates any portion of the Business or to execute the Stock and

the lawful money of the United States.

 

(b) Each accounting term set forth herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning accorded it under GAAP.

 

(c) Except as provided in Section 2.03(b), whenever conversion of values from

York City time (the " _Exchange Rate_ ") three (3) business days prior to the
applicable date or dates.

 

(d) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, 16

 

 state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to a party or to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a party to, a Section of, or an Exhibit
to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule to the

and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used
in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun
or pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and
to cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred
to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, supplemented or modified, including (i) (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and (ii) all attachments thereto
and instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset" and "property" shall
be construed to have the same meaning and effect. References to a Person are
also to its permitted successors and assigns. In the event of any conflict
between this Agreement and any Country Transfer Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

ARTICLE II __

 

 _Closings_

SECTION 2.01.  _Closings_. (a) The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests relating to the Principal
Country Units and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities relating to the
Principal Country Units (the " _Principal Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP in New York, New York, at 10:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the second business day following the satisfaction (or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of the conditions set
forth in Article V with respect to the Principal Closing (excluding those
conditions intended to be satisfied at the Principal Closing but subject to
their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver at
such time). The date on which the Principal Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Principal Closing Date_." The Principal Closing shall
be deemed to occur and be effective at 11:59 P.M., local time, on the date of
such Principal Closing. The parties 17

 

 hereto specifically acknowledge that time is of the essence because Sellers
intention to exit the Business is or will become known to its employees,
customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Seller.

(b) The closing of the transfer of the Transferred Assets and Transferred
Equity Interests relating to each Non-Principal Country Unit and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities relating to such Non-Principal Country
Unit will occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the Principal
Closing Date on the date agreed to by Buyer and Seller within the period
specified in _Exhibit E_ to the Transition Services Agreement, so long as the
conditions set forth in Article V with respect to such Non-Principal Country
Unit (excluding those conditions intended to be satisfied at such Closing but
subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver at such time) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waived by such date (each such date, a " _Non-Principal
Country Unit Closing Date_ "). During the period from the Principal Closing
until the occurrence of the applicable Non-Principal Country Unit Closing,
none of the assets or liabilities of the applicable Non-Principal Country Unit
shall be transferred to or assumed by Buyer, as the case may be, but Seller
shall hold and operate such Non-Principal Country Unit in a manner consistent
with Sellers obligations under Section 6.01. The parties shall enter into a
distribution arrangement with respect to such Non-Principal Country Unit
giving effect to the foregoing, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

SECTION 2.02.  _Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests/Excluded
Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_. (a) _Transferred Assets and
Transferred Equity Interests_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Applicable Closing, Seller
will, and will cause the relevant Asset Selling Affiliates to, sell, convey,
assign, and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept,
the Transferred Assets related to the applicable Country Unit, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Accordingly, Seller will, or will
cause the relevant Asset Selling Affiliates to, execute and deliver at the
Principal Closing a general assignment and bill of sale in the form of 
_Exhibit B_ (the " _General Assignment_ "), a general patent assignment in the
form of _Exhibit C_ (the " _Patent Assignment_ ") and a general trademark
assignment in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Trademark Assignment_ ") and at
each Applicable Closing such other instruments of conveyance, assignment and
transfer as Buyer reasonably requests (the form and substance of which shall
be mutually agreed between the parties), in each case to convey to Buyer all
of Sellers or each Asset Selling Affiliates right, title and interest in and
to the applicable Transferred Assets. In addition, pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Applicable
Closing, Seller will, and will cause the relevant Stock Selling Affiliates to,
sell, convey, assign, and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire
and accept, the Transferred Equity Interests (and will indirectly acquire and
accept by means of such purchase acquisition and acceptance, the equity
interests in any Transferred Company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
another Transferred Company) related to the applicable Country Unit, free
and clear of all Liens. Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause the relevant
Stock Selling Affiliates to, deliver at the Applicable Closing stock
certificates representing the Transferred Equity Interests, together with a
stock power endorsed in blank.  18

 

(b) _Excluded Assets_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) right, title or interest in any asset
that is not a Transferred Asset or Transferred Equity Interest. Specifically,
Sellers (and any of its Affiliates) right, title or interest in any
Excluded Asset is not being conveyed to Buyer.

(c) _Assumed Liabilities_. At the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Unit and shall agree to
satisfy and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities related to the
applicable Country Unit. After the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall pay all
Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Units as and when such
liabilities become due. Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller at the
Principal Closing an assumption agreement in the form of  _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Assumption Agreement_ ") and at each Non-Principal Country Unit Closing such
other agreements and instruments as Seller reasonably requests (the form and
substance of which shall be mutually agreed between the parties), whereby
Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes to pay, perform and discharge as and
when due, the Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Units. For
the avoidance of doubt, at the Applicable Closing, by means of
the acquisition of the Transferred Equity Interests and not by means of a
direct assumption of such liabilities by Buyer, Buyer shall be responsible for
the liabilities of the Transferred Companies that would otherwise constitute
Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Annex 2.02(c)_ (as more specifically set
forth in Section 6.08).

(d) _Excluded Liabilities_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to pay,
perform or otherwise discharge, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, any Excluded Liability. Seller and its Affiliates will remain
liable to pay, perform and discharge when due, all Excluded Liabilities. For
the avoidance of doubt, at the Applicable Closing, the acquisition of the
Transferred Equity Interests shall not result in the assumption by Buyer of
the liabilities and obligations of the Transferred Companies that would
otherwise constitute Excluded Liabilities pursuant to _Annex 2.02(d)_ (as more
specifically set forth in Section 6.08).

 

(e) _Country Transfer Agreements_. To the extent required by applicable Law or
as deemed necessary by either of the parties hereto, the transfer of each
Country Unit will be effected pursuant to a short-form agreement or one or
more instruments of transfer, such as a bill of sale, share transfer
agreement, business transfer agreement, real estate transfer agreement or
other asset assignment document, which agreement shall be prepared by Seller
and shall be on terms mutually agreed between the parties hereto and
consistent with and as close as reasonably possible to the applicable terms of
this Agreement (each, a " _Country Transfer Agreement_ "). The parties shall
enter into the Country Transfer Agreements as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof and not later than the relevant Applicable Closing.

 

(f) _Designation of Affiliates_. To the extent that any of the Transferred
Assets or Transferred Equity Interests are under the control of any of
Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to promptly take such
legal action as may be necessary to 19

 

 consummate the transfer to Buyer and its Affiliates of such Transferred
Assets or Transferred Equity Interests under terms and conditions which are
consistent with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Prior to, and in
any event at least 30 days in advance of, any Applicable Closing, Buyer may
designate, with the consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), one or more Affiliates to, at such Applicable Closing, (i) acquire
all or part of the Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests, (ii)
assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities or (iii) pay a designated
portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.03, in each case related
to the applicable Country Unit, as the case may be, in which event all
references herein to Buyer will be deemed to refer to such Affiliates, as
appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such designation will in
any event limit or affect the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement to
the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

(g) _Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent_. To the extent that
the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals
(including Anti-Trust Approvals), consents or waivers and such authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the
Applicable Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery thereof. From the date hereof until eighteen
(18) months after the Applicable Closing Date, the parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to
obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and to
give any notices required for the transfer of such Transferred Asset and to
obtain from third parties an approval or consent to establish a new contract
with Buyer or its designated Affiliate with respect to the portion of any
Commingled Contract related to the Business, pursuant to which Buyer or its
designated Affiliate will have access to the rights and benefits of such
Commingled Contract with respect to the Business on substantially the same
terms and conditions provided to Seller and its Affiliates prior to the
Applicable Closing, or to assign such portion to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be
required to pay any consideration (other than customary filing and application
fees typically paid by a seller or transferee) or make any concession
therefor. If such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained,
Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such Transferred
Asset or, if applicable, that portion of any Commingled Contract, as the case
may be, to Buyer or its designee pursuant to Section 2.02(f) at no additional
cost. Pending the earlier of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent
or waiver or the expiration of such eighteen-month (18 month) period, insofar
as reasonably practicable and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Seller shall hold such Transferred Assets for the benefit of Buyer and shall
operate such Transferred Assets in a manner to place Buyer in a substantially
similar position as if such Transferred Assets had been sold, conveyed,
assigned and transferred. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Seller in connection with any actions taken by Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.02(g). Buyer further agrees that, if Seller shall have
complied with its obligations under this Agreement with respect to using
reasonable best efforts to obtain such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver, Seller shall not be in breach of this Agreement solely as a result of
the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. 20

 

(h) _Buyer s Recording and Similar Responsibilities_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02, it shall be Buyers responsibility
(i) to prepare the applicable country patent assignments and trademark
assignments in respect of the Transferred IP and to record such assignments
following execution thereof by Seller (or its applicable Affiliate), (ii) to
apply for its own marketing authorizations for the Products to the relevant
regulatory authorities where it is not within the power of Seller to cause, by
giving notice to the applicable regulatory authority or otherwise, the
transfer directly to Buyer of the existing marketing authorizations that are
Transferred Assets and (iii) to bear the fees and other costs in accordance
with Section 2.06(d). Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide all reasonable assistance to Buyer in connection with the foregoing at
Buyers expense.

(i)  _Japan Corporate Split_. Seller may elect (on notice to Buyer no later
than forty-five (45) calendar days after the date of this Agreement) to
transfer, assign and convey to Buyer on the Applicable Closing Date the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities relating to Japan by way of a
"corporate split" pursuant to Japan Corporate-Split Law. If Seller so elects,
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and
deliver a Country Transfer Agreement or other document, the form and
substance of which shall be mutually agreed between the parties (it being
understood that, in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any
Country Transfer Agreement or other document, the terms of this Agreement
shall control), and to take such other actions, as may be necessary or
desirable to give effect to the foregoing, including, if applicable, amending
_Schedule 3.01(b)_ to the Disclosure Letter to include a newly formed
subsidiary of either Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (" _Japan NewCo_ "), in
which case Japan NewCo shall be deemed to be a Transferred Company for all
purposes hereof.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Principal Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause one or
more of its Affiliates as Buyer may designate pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to)
pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller
may designate), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or
more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller at least two business days
prior to the Principal Closing Date, cash in U.S. dollars (subject to Section
2.03(b)) in an amount exclusive of any Transfer Taxes equal to the
Purchase Price.

(b) Buyer shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price applicable to the
Country Units identified on Schedule 2.03(b) to the Disclosure Letter in the
applicable Foreign Currency set forth on such Schedule. The conversion rate
from U.S. dollars to the applicable Foreign Currency shall be the closing rate
provided by Bloomberg at 5:00 A.M. New York City time two (2) business days
prior to the Principal Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
applicable Law in a Country Unit identified on Schedule 2.03(b) to the
Disclosure Letter requires that the applicable portion of the Purchase
Price be paid by a legal entity organized under the laws of such Country
Unit, and Buyer reasonably requires more than two business days to convert
U.S. dollars into the 21

 

 applicable Foreign Currency and thereafter transfer such funds to one of its
Affiliates so organized, then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to agree on an alternative conversion mechanism that will allow Buyer to pay
the applicable portion of the Purchase Price on the Principal Closing Date in
accordance with applicable Law. Schedule 2.03(b) to the Disclosure Letter sets
forth Sellers good-faith estimate as of the date of this Agreement of the
portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to each Country Unit identified
therein for payment in a Foreign Currency.

 

(c) The " _Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to one billion nine hundred forty
four million dollars ($1,944,000,000) increased or decreased as a result of
the inventory adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 2.04, and shall be
allocated as described in Section 2.05.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) For the purposes of
clarification only, Seller is retaining all accounts payable and accounts
receivable with respect to each Country Unit arising out of the operation and
conduct of the Business before the Applicable Closing for such Country Unit
and the only purchase price adjustment after any Closing with respect to
changes in the working capital of the Business will be the adjustment of the
Inventory pursuant to this Section 2.04.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement in the form of _Schedule 2.04(b)_ to
the Disclosure Letter (in its draft form, a " _Price Adjustment Statement_
"), setting forth, with respect to each applicable Country Unit, (i) the book
value of the Inventory, prepared in accordance with the Accounting Policies,
transferred to Buyer in respect of such Country Unit as of the Applicable
Closing Date (the " _Closing Inventory_ ") and (ii) the Prepaid Tax Amount as
of the Principal Closing Date. To the extent that the book value of the
applicable Closing Inventory is greater than the applicable Inventory Target
or less than the applicable Inventory Target, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as described in Section 2.04(f) below. To the extent that the Prepaid
Tax Amount (once final and binding pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2.04) as of the Principal Closing Date is greater than the Estimated Prepaid
Tax Amount or less than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as described in Section 2.04(g) below.

 

(c) In connection with the preparation of each Price Adjustment Statement, (i)
Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to assist, Seller, its
accountants, advisors and other representatives in its preparation of each
Price Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to Seller, its accountants, advisors
and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to
the personnel, properties, books and records of the Business to the extent
relevant to the preparation of any Price Adjustment Statement (including
taking and preparing physical counts of Inventory) and (ii) Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, consult with Buyer in good faith and provide
Buyer, its accountants, advisors and other representatives with any reasonably
requested information, data or back-up materials with respect to the
calculation of the Closing Inventory. For purposes of this Section 2.04, the
calculation of book value of the Inventory will reflect any accounting
reserves or adjustments (net of obsolescence) and otherwise be determined in a
manner consistent with Sellers 22

 

 Inventory and other relevant accounting policies used in the preparation of
the Financial Information, set forth in _Schedule 2.04(c)_ to the Disclosure
Letter (the " _Accounting Policies_ ").

(d) Each Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer
unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement
so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then
the relevant Price Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause
(x) or (y) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
earlier of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve any differences they have
with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the
date any matters in dispute are resolved by an accounting firm (in accordance
with the procedure set forth in this Section 2.04) selected by Seller and
Buyer or, if the parties are unable to agree, an independent accounting firm
selected by Sellers and Buyers independent accounting firms (such firm, the
" _Accounting Firm_ ").

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Section 11.12 shall not apply to any dispute described
in this Section 2.04. During the thirty-(30) day period immediately following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty-
(30) day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution
by the Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain in dispute and which
were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Accounting Firm shall
make a final determination of the values set forth on the relevant Price
Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare the
relevant final Price Adjustment Statement), which determination shall be
binding on the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , the scope of such
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to: (i) those matters
that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of Disagreement;
(ii) whether, for each calculation of Inventory, such calculation was prepared
in accordance with this Section 2.04, specifically, whether the Accounting
Policies were used; and (iii) whether there were mathematical errors in the
relevant Price Adjustment Statement, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized
or permitted to make any other determination. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make
any determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.06 or any other
representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with any of the covenants in this
Agreement (other than this Section 2.04). The relevant Price Adjustment
Statement shall become final and binding on Buyer and Seller on the date the
Accounting Firm delivers the relevant final Price Adjustment Statement to the
parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
2.04 shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

 

(f) If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of the
applicable Closing Inventory exceeds the applicable Inventory Target, then
the amount of 23

 

 such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase
Price. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of the
applicable Closing Inventory is less than the applicable Inventory Target,
then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of such deficit. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the
book value of the applicable Closing Inventory is equal to the applicable
Inventory Target, then there shall be no Inventory adjustment to the Purchase
Price in respect of the Applicable Closing.

(g) If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Prepaid Tax Amount
as of the Principal Closing Date exceeds the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount,
then the amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to
the Purchase Price. If the Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the
Prepaid Tax Amount as of the Principal Closing Date is less than the Estimated
Prepaid Tax Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such deficit. If the Price Adjustment Statement
discloses that the Prepaid Tax Amount as of the Principal Closing Date is
equal to the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, then there shall be no Prepaid Tax
Amount adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of the Principal Closing.

(h) No payment pursuant to Section 2.04(f) or Section 2.04(g) need be made by
either party until the date that is fifteen (15) business days after the
determination of each final Price Adjustment Statement (the " _Purchase Price
Adjustment Due Date_ "); _provided_ that, on or before any Purchase Price
Adjustment Due Date, (i) Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be
designated by Buyer) shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more
of the Selling Affiliates as may be designated by Seller), in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in
writing by Seller at least two business days prior to such Purchase Price
Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the positive
Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.04(f) or Section 2.04(g), if any,
or (ii) Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by
Seller) shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer (or one or more of its
Affiliates as may be designated by Buyer), in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Buyer at
least two business days prior to such Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, cash
in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the negative Purchase Price adjustment
under Section 2.04(f) or Section 2.04(g), if any.

SECTION 2.05. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a)Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an allocation of the Purchase
Price (the " _Allocation_ ") prior to the Principal Closing Date. The
Allocation shall allocate the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities among
each of the Transferred Assets and Transferred Equity Interests (and among
the assets held by Cordis Corporation) in a manner that incorporates, reflects
and is consistent with Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code and this Section
2.05(a).

 

(b) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the date of this Agreement,
Seller shall deliver a reasonable draft of the Allocation (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ ") to Buyer. Except as provided in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of
this Section 2.05, at the close of business on the forty-fifth (45th) calendar
day after delivery of the Proposed  24

 

 Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be set forth on _Schedule 2.05(b)_ to the Disclosure Letter (the
" _Allocation Schedule_ "), and shall be the Allocation.

(c) Buyer shall raise any objection (so long as such objection is reasonable)
to the Proposed Allocation in writing within forty-five (45) calendar days of
the delivery of the Proposed Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any differences within thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery of Buyers objection. If Buyer and Seller reach written agreement
amending the Proposed Allocation within such thirty (30) calendar day period
the Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be the
Allocation.

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute
resolution provisions set forth in Section 11.12 of this Agreement shall not
apply to any dispute described in this Section 2.05. If Buyer and Seller
cannot agree on the Allocation within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery
of Buyers objection, then all remaining disputed items shall be submitted
for resolution by an independent appraisal firm mutually selected by Buyer and
Seller. Buyer and Seller shall each request that the independent appraisal
firm make a final determination as to the disputed items within thirty (30)
calendar days after such submission. The Proposed Allocation shall be amended
in accordance with the findings of such independent appraisal firm, and the
Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be the
Allocation. The fees, costs and expenses of the independent appraisal firm
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 

(e) The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments (including
those described in Section 2.04) to the Purchase Price under this Agreement.
If, after all adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with
respect to the Closing Inventory of any Selling Affiliate, when expressed in
the relevant local currency at the Exchange Rate used to determine the
Closing Inventory is different from the local currency net book value
recorded on the statutory books for the Closing Inventory of such Selling
Affiliate as of the Applicable Closing Date, then the Allocation with respect
to the Closing Inventory of such Selling Affiliate shall be adjusted so that
it is equal to such local currency net book value, and the parties will agree
to a corresponding upward or downward adjustment (as appropriate) elsewhere in
the Allocation.

 

(f) Each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and
file its Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) on a
basis consistent with the Allocation and shall take no position inconsistent
with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing
Authority or otherwise. In the event that the Allocation is disputed by any
Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly
notify the other party hereto, and both Seller and Buyer agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit or
similar proceeding. 25

 

(g) In the event that the Allocation has not become final pursuant to this
Section 2.05 by the Applicable Closing:

(i) The allocated purchase prices included in the Proposed Allocation shall be
used for the purpose of (A) including allocated purchase prices in the
Country Transfer Agreements for each Country Unit and (B) determining the
amount of any payments made on the Principal Closing Date to the applicable
Selling Affiliate with respect to such Country Unit. The inclusion of such
allocated purchase prices shall not be deemed to waive, amend or otherwise
alter any of the rights or obligations of the parties set forth in this
Section 2.05 and shall not be used for any purpose in resolving, or result in
any prejudice with respect to, any dispute with respect to the Proposed
Allocation or the Allocation.

 

(ii) To the extent that the amounts paid to any Selling Affiliate on the
Principal Closing Date are not equal to the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Selling Affiliate in the Allocation (with respect to any
Selling Affiliate, the " _Allocated Purchase Price_ "), the parties shall and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to take all necessary actions to
refund, repay and redistribute as promptly as reasonably practicable any
amounts paid to any Selling Affiliate in excess of such Selling Affiliates
Allocated Purchase Price, such that, after giving effect to any such
refunds, repayments and redistributions, the amounts received by each Selling
Affiliate shall be equal to such Selling Affiliates Allocated Purchase Price.

 

SECTION 2.06. _Transfer Taxes and Other Costs_. (a) All Transfer Taxes imposed
on the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests and the Transferred
Assets to Buyer and assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer shall be
borne and paid solely by Buyer when due in compliance with applicable Transfer
Tax laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller is required by applicable
Law to pay any such Transfer Taxes, then Seller shall pay such Transfer Taxes,
and Buyer shall, subject to receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of
Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller, whether or not
such Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

(b) Subject to Buyer providing Seller, at Sellers request, with a list of
Buyers Affiliates that Buyer has designated pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to
purchase Transferred Assets or Transferred Equity Interests at least thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer at least twenty-five (25) calendar days before the Applicable Closing
Date a schedule of expected Transfer Taxes with respect to the Applicable
Closing by Seller or any Selling Affiliate as reasonably determined by
Seller. Seller shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by Buyer, to minimize
the amount of Transfer Taxes payable, including by claiming any available
exemption or any available refund, credit or other recovery, and by executing
and filing any invoices, forms or certificates reasonably required. The
parties shall provide each other with any information reasonably requested in
order to comply with applicable Transfer Tax Laws, where such information is
connected with the Transfer Tax treatment or position in connection with the
Transactions. The amount of any refund, credit or other recovery received or
utilized by Seller of any Transfer Taxes shall be paid promptly by Seller to
Buyer. 26

 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to minimize any Transfer
Taxes described in Section 2.06(a) to the greatest extent permitted by
applicable Law, including pursuant to any available exemption. Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.06(d), the parties intend that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, sales of the Transferred Assets pursuant to this
Agreement will be treated as a transfer of a going concern for VAT purposes.

 

(d) As between Buyer and Seller, the determination of the amount of any
Transfer Taxes (including whether any exemption from (or reduction
in) Transfer Taxes is available) required to be paid to a Governmental Entity
with respect to the consummation of the Transactions shall be made by Seller
in good faith in its sole reasonable discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Buyer reasonably disagrees with Sellers determination with respect to any
Transfer Tax and obtains prior to the applicable due date of the Transfer Tax
(or prior to any other relevant date) a Reliance Opinion (which Reliance
Opinion shall be addressed to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, and not to
Seller, but a copy of which is provided to Seller) to support Buyers position
(it being agreed that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for half of any cost and
expense incurred in obtaining such Reliance Opinion), then Buyers position
shall control. Subject to the above, Seller shall control any Tax Proceeding
relating to the availability of any exemption from Transfer Taxes required to
be paid with respect to the consummation of the Transactions ; _provided_
that Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account
of each phase of such Tax Proceeding, shall consult with Buyer before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, shall provide
Buyer with drafts of any written materials prepared in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, shall reflect any reasonable comments provided by Buyer in
respect of any written materials prepared in connection with such
Tax Proceeding and shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

 

(e) All costs and fees (other than Transfer Taxes, Sellers legal expenses and
any allocation of corporate overhead of Seller or any of its Affiliates)
associated with transferring to Buyer or one of its Affiliates the Transferred
IP, the Transferred IT and marketing authorizations for the Products conveyed
to Buyer at the Applicable Closing shall be borne and paid solely by
Buyer and when due; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such amount shall be
incurred by Seller, Buyer shall, subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence
of Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller.

 

(f) All costs and expenses (other than Transfer Taxes) associated with
removing and moving any tangible Transferred Asset to a location designated
by Buyer shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer when due; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such amount shall be incurred by Seller, Buyer shall,
subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment
thereof, promptly reimburse Seller. 27

 

SECTION 2.07. _Withholding Taxes_

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall be permitted and entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Within fifteen (15)
days of the expected Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver a schedule
of expected withholding amounts to Seller. Furthermore, Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with each other to reduce the amount of withholding
Taxes imposed on the payment of any amount to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, including by reasonably cooperating in order to execute and
file any forms or certificates reasonably required to claim an available
reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding Taxes.

 

SECTION 2.08. _Delivery by Seller_. (a) At the Principal Closing, Seller will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless delivered previously), the
following:

the parties. 28

 

(b) At each Non-Principal Country Unit Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause
to be delivered any applicable Country Transfer Agreement and any other

to each Country Unit to be transferred at such Non-Principal Country Unit
Closing.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Representations and Warranties of Seller_

 

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Transferred Assets are sold "as is,
where is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Transferred Assets on the relevant
Closing Date in the condition they are in at the place they are located on
such Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature made by, on behalf of or imputed
to Seller, other than the representations and warranties of Seller expressly
set forth in this Agreement. BUYER AGREES THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES GIVEN HEREIN BY SELLER ARE IN 29

 

 LIEU OF, AND BUYER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO, ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE APPLICABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER STATUTE, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Subject to the foregoing and except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter,
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

of incorporation or formation, and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease and operate its respective properties relating to

in the Data Room.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.01(b)(i)_ to the Disclosure Letter sets forth the authorized
capitalization of each of the Transferred Companies and the number of shares
of each class of capital stock or other equity interests in each of the

obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem any shares of capital
stock or other securities or other equity interests of any of the Transferred

than being party to certain Commingled Contracts and other than immaterial
collaboration on marketing activities such as shared trade show booths.

SECTION 3.05. _Transferred Real Property_. (a) (i) Seller or a
Transferred Company has good and valid title to the Transferred Real
Property, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and (ii)
_Schedule 3.05(a)_ to the Disclosure Letter sets forth all leases, subleases,

(iii) there are no outstanding unpaid assessment notices against any of the

being the subject of Section 3.14.

 

SECTION 3.06. _Financial Information; No Undisclosed Liabilities_. (a) The
Financial Information provided to Buyer has been prepared from the books and
records of Seller and has been prepared in accordance with the Accounting

Seller contained in this Agreement that could reasonably be expected to cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b) not to
be satisfied, it being understood and agreed, however, that if Seller fails
to provide notice pursuant to this Section 6.04 such failure to provide notice
shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of Article V or Article
X.

 

SECTION 6.05. _Publicity_. No party to this Agreement shall originate any
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, written or
oral, whether relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the existence of any arrangement between the parties, without the
prior written consent of the other party whether or not named in such
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, except (x) each
party may issue a press release (or, if the parties agree, a joint press
release) in connection with the receipt of the Final Binding Offer Letter,
acceptance of the Final Binding Offer Letter and the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and each party may, from time to time, refer to the
Transactions in customary investor calls, investor meetings and other investor
relations activities (including any such calls, meetings or activities
specifically related to the Transactions), (y) either party may originate any
such publicity, news release or other similar public announcement as may be
required by Law (including the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission), listing rules or any listing or trading agreement
concerning its publicly traded securities and (z) to the extent the contents
of such publicity, news release or other similar public announcement
have previously been released publicly or are consistent in all material
respects with materials that have previously been released (without violation
of this Section 6.05); _provided_ that in such event under clauses (x) and
(y), the party issuing same shall still be required to consult with the other
party, whether or not named in such publicity, news release or other similar
public announcement, a reasonable time prior to its release (to the extent
practicable) to allow the other party to comment thereon and, after its
release, shall provide the other party with a copy thereof. If Buyer, based on
the advice of its counsel, determines that this Agreement, or any of the other
Transaction Documents, must be publicly filed with a Governmental Entity
(other 54

 

 than filings required to be made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission), then Buyer, prior to making any such filing, shall provide Seller
and its counsel with a redacted version of this Agreement (and any other
Transaction Document) which it intends to file, and will give due
consideration to any comments provided by Seller or its counsel.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Approvals; Access_.
Subject to any obligation imposed by Law, including all anti-trust and
competition Laws:

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including Section 2.02(g), each of Seller and Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make the Anti-Trust Filings and any
other filings required by applicable Law, (ii) obtain consents, approvals
(including Anti-Trust Approvals), authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Entities and other third parties and (iii) take other actions,
in each case as is necessary to consummate the Transactions as soon as
reasonably practical following the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that
Seller shall have no obligation to pay money (other than customary filing and
application fees typically paid by a seller or transferee) or make any
concessions to obtain such consents. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer
agrees to provide such evidence as to financial capability, resources and
creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by any third party whose
consent or approval is sought hereunder. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each of the parties hereto will cooperate with
and furnish to the other party such necessary information and assistance as
such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer
shall file the Anti-Trust Filings and any other filings required under any
applicable Laws. With respect to filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, Seller and Buyer shall make their
respective filings no later than ten (10) business days following the date
hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the parties). Seller
and Buyer shall provide to any Governmental Entity whose consent,
authorization, order or approval is required in connection with the
Transactions any additional information required under any applicable Laws or
otherwise properly requested. The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of any applicable waiting
period, to the extent required, from the applicable Governmental Entities.
The parties also shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
by providing information reasonably requested by the other party in order to
fulfill the foregoing obligations as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(c) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Buyer
and Seller and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult or, where required
by applicable Law, cooperate with the other on, any filing made with, or
written  55

Transactions, (ii) promptly inform each other of any communication (or other
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions, (iii) consult with the other
party, and consider in good faith the views of the other party, prior to
entering into any agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions and (iv) furnish each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings and written communications between them or their subsidiaries or
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or its respective
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Transactions. Buyer and Seller
shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other and their respective
counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any in-
person discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions and
to participate in the preparation for such discussion or meeting. Buyer and
Seller also agree to keep the other fully informed about any anti-trust
issues raised by any Governmental Entity.

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.06, to the extent necessary to obtain the
waiver or consent from any Governmental Entity required to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Sections 5.01(f) or 5.02(f), as applicable, to obtain
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders of Governmental
Entities or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any
Principal Closing Legal Impediment or Non-Principal Closing Legal Impediment,
Buyer shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.06(d): (i)
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
and in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, the sale,
divestiture or disposition (including by licensing any intellectual property
rights) of any assets of the Business; (ii) terminate or modify any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Business; (iii)
otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is
capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such
action, that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the assets of the Business; and (iv) take promptly, in the
event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the Transactions unlawful or that would prevent or delay
consummation of the Transactions, any and all steps (including the posting of
a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) of this
subsection (d)) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or
order. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any such action
or do any thing to satisfy the conditions in Sections 5.01(f) and 5.02(f) on
or before the date that is the six-month anniversary of the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to take any action or do any thing if the taking of
such action or doing of such thing, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Buyer after
giving effect to the Transactions (measured on a scale relative to a company
the size of the Business). 56

 

(e) Seller shall give Buyer and its accountants, legal counsel and
other representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and
without undue interruption of the Business throughout the period prior to the
Applicable Closing, to all of the properties, books and records (other than
records relating to income Taxes and attorney-client privileged
communications and, for the avoidance of doubt, other than where access to
such information is prohibited by applicable Law) relating to the Business,
and will furnish, at Buyers expense, Buyer, its accountants, legal counsel
and other representatives during such period all such information (other than
records relating to income Taxes and attorney-client privileged communications
and, for the avoidance of doubt, other than where access to such information
is prohibited by applicable Law) concerning the affairs of the Business as
Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ that this Section 6.06(e) shall not
entitle Buyer or its accountants, legal counsel or other representatives
to contact any third party doing business with Seller or access the
properties, books or records of any such third party, in each case without
Sellers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Buyer will hold in confidence all information so obtained.

(f) From the date hereof until the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall
timely prepare, and promptly deliver to Buyer, with respect to the Business,
a statement of sales, on a monthly basis, and a statement of profit and loss,
on a quarterly basis, in each case to be consistent with such financial
information previously provided to Buyer by Seller.

(g) Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Affiliates and the Transferred
Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Buyer
prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the date hereof or as promptly as
practicable thereafter each Material Distribution Contract; _provided_ that,
solely for the purposes of this Section 6.06(g), the expected annual revenue
threshold in the definition of "Material Distribution Contract" shall be
deemed to be two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

 

SECTION 6.07. _Financing_. (a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other advisors and representatives to,
provide commercially reasonable cooperation in connection with
the arrangement by Buyer of bank financing and/or bond offerings for the
purpose of financing the Transactions, the fees and expenses incurred in
connection therewith and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; _provided_ that
(i) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to provide any audited or unaudited "carve-
out" financial statements of the Business and (iii) Seller and its Affiliates
shall not be required to provide any updates to the Financial Information.
Buyer shall, promptly upon request 57

 

 by Seller, reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller
or any of its Affiliates in connection with such cooperation. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Damages suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith. Seller shall have the right to
consent to the use of its and its Affiliates logos in connection with the
Debt Financing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.07, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the Transactions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are not contingent on
any debt or equity financing (including the Debt Financing) or the receipt of
the proceeds therefrom.

 

SECTION 6.08. _Transferred Companies Assets and Liabilities_. Prior to the
Applicable Closing, Seller shall take or cause to be taken, such action as is
necessary or appropriate to transfer, assign or convey (i) any assets owned or
held by the Transferred Companies other than those that would constitute
Transferred Assets or (ii) any liabilities or obligations of the Transferred
Companies other than those that would constitute Assumed Liabilities, in each
case, to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller such that as of the Applicable
Closing, (i) the assets owned or held by the Transferred Companies consist
solely of assets that would otherwise constitute Transferred Assets pursuant
to clauses (i)  (xvii) and (xix)  (xxi) of _Annex 2.02(a)_ and (ii) the
liabilities and obligations of the Transferred Companies consist solely of
liabilities and obligations that would otherwise constitute Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to clauses (i)  (ix) of _Annex 2.02(c)_. Prior to or
following the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller the necessary
information and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents and other
documents and instruments as may be reasonably required to permit Seller at
its expense to effect and perfect the transfer of any registrations of Patents
and Trademarks that constitute Excluded Assets but which are held by a
Transferred Company.

SECTION 6.09. _Exclusivity_. (a) From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Applicable Closing Date or termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates,
the Transferred Companies and its and their respective directors, officers or
employees, or any attorney, accountant or other representative retained by any
of them (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
non-public information), or take any other action designed or reasonably
likely to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with
respect to, any Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into or approve any

Affiliates or any of the Transferred Companies shall release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement with respect
to the Business to which it is a party and which was entered into with respect
to any potential Alternative Proposal. Seller and its Affiliates shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, with respect to third 58

its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or destruction of, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement,
confidential information previously furnished by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or its or their Representatives, with respect to the Business.

 

(b) Seller will promptly notify Buyer orally (and then in writing within
twenty-four (24) hours) after it or any of its Affiliates has received any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, any request for
discussions or negotiations, or any request for information relating to
the Business in connection with an Alternative Proposal or a potential
Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records
thereof of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is or becomes aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing. Such notice to Buyer shall indicate the identity
of the person making such proposal and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any. Seller shall also promptly provide Buyer with (i) a copy of
any written notice or other written communication from any person informing
Seller or any of its Affiliates that it is considering making, or has made a
proposal regarding, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Alternative
Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Seller or any of its
Affiliates and (iii) such other details of any such Alternative Proposal that
Buyer may reasonably request. Thereafter, Seller shall promptly keep Buyer
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to
the terms of any such Alternative Proposal.

(c) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any
expression of interest by any third party relating to Sellers or any of its
Affiliates willingness or ability to receive or discuss a proposal or offer,
other than a proposal or offer by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for
any merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, acquisition or other business combination, in each
case relating to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the
Business.

any of the Excluded Assets has been transferred to Buyer, it shall promptly
notify the other and the parties hereto shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable and, subject to Section 2.02(g) and Section 2.06, ensure that such
property is transferred, with any necessary prior third-party consent or
approval, to:

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset which was not transferred at

Companies) in respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Applicable Closing Date. Seller
shall also prepare and file all Tax Returns for Transferred Companies that are
required to be included in (or filed with) a Tax Return of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Company) is parent for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods. Any Tax Returns required to be prepared pursuant to this Section
7.08(a)(i) shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of
the Transferred Company or with respect to the Transferred Assets or the
Business, respectively.

 

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns (other than those
relating to Transfer Taxes, such Tax Returns being addressed by Section 2.06)
required to be filed by the Transferred Companies, or in respect of the
Transferred Assets or the Business, and any such Tax Returns of Transferred
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Companies as
applicable, unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing that a different position
is  62

of such issue (and each party shall reasonably endeavor to reach such mutual
agreement). With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Buyer for
or including a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller for its
approval, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return in the case of an income Tax Return, and at least ten (10)

responsible pursuant to Section 7.08(d)(i) and a copy of such Tax Return,
together with any additional information that Seller may reasonably request.
Seller shall have the right to review such Tax Return, statement
and additional information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return,
and Buyer shall reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted
by Seller at least five (5) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Any
Tax Return of a Transferred Company or an Asset Selling Affiliate for a Tax
period that would otherwise be a Straddle Period shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be filed on the basis that the relevant Tax
period ended as of the close of business on the Applicable Closing Date.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred Company)
shall file an amended Tax Return or agree to any waiver or extension of the
statute of limitations relating to Taxes with respect to any Transferred
Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or a Straddle Period), to the extent such amendment, waiver or extension
would reasonably be expected to increase Sellers liability for Taxes under
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(iii) All Taxes due and payable with respect to Tax Returns described in
Section 7.08(a) will be paid by the filer, subject to reimbursement by the
other party pursuant to Section 7.08(d); _provided_ that, with respect to any
Tax Return described in Section 7.08(a)(ii) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period, Seller shall pay any Excluded Taxes or any Taxes that are
Excluded Liabilities, in each case relating to such Tax Return, to Buyer no
later than five (5) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return.

(b) _Carryforwards and Carrybacks_. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, hereby waives
any right to use or apply with respect to the consolidated federal income Tax
Return of the consolidated group of which the Johnson and Johnson is the common
parent in any Pre-Closing Tax Period any Tax asset, including any net capital
loss, net operating loss, foreign Tax credit, charitable contribution credit
or research and development credit, of any Transferred Company arising in any
Tax period ending after the Applicable Closing Date. 63

 

(c) _Refunds_.

 

(i) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) of, any refund (including any credit in lieu of a
refund, which credit arises as a result of an overpayment and which otherwise
would have been payable in cash by the relevant Taxing Authority at
the election of the taxpayer) received or realized in cash with respect to
Taxes attributable to any Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the
Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Transfer Taxes), including
any such amounts arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Applicable Closing Date, but only to the extent that (A) such refund (or
credit) is not the result of an event that occurred after the Applicable
Closing Date and does not relate to the Prepaid Tax Amount, and (B) such
refund (or credit) is not attributable to, and does not result from, a carry
back or other use of any item of loss, deduction, credit or other similar item
arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period or, in the case of a refund (or credit)
of Taxes for a Straddle Period, the use of any such item arising in a Post-
Closing Tax Period. In connection with the foregoing, if Seller determines
that any of the Transferred Companies is entitled to file or make a formal
or informal claim for a refund (to which Seller would be entitled under the
first sentence of this Section 7.08(c)(i)) of Taxes (including by filing an
amended Tax Return) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall be
entitled, at Sellers expense, to file or make, or to request that Buyer
cause the applicable Transferred Company to file or make, such formal or
informal claim for refund, and Seller shall be entitled to control the
prosecution of such claim for refund, provided that Seller shall not take any
action in connection therewith that would bind Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Company) for a Post-Closing Tax Period or otherwise
adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred
Company). Buyer will cooperate, and cause the Transferred Companies to
cooperate, with respect to such claim for refund, and will pay, or cause the
relevant Transferred Company to pay, to Seller the amount (including interest
received from any Taxing Authority) of any related refund (including any
credit in lieu of a refund, which credit arises as a result of an overpayment
and which otherwise would have been payable in cash by the relevant Taxing
Authority at the election of the taxpayer) (to which Seller would be entitled
under the first sentence of this Section 7.08(c)(i)) received or realized in
cash by Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (including any Transferred Company),
net of any unreimbursed costs incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in respect
of such refund and reduced by the amount of any Taxes arising or that would
arise as a result of the receipt of such refund or interest thereon, within
five (5) days of receipt (or realization in cash) thereof. Buyer and the
Transferred Companies shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Seller with respect to, any other refund, credit, offset or other similar
benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to any
Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business. Notwithstanding
any other provision, Buyer shall be entitled to any refund, credit or
reimbursement arising from or relating to any Transfer Taxes. 64

 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax basis, net operating loss, credit
or other item that reduces Taxes paid or payable that may exist in any
Transferred Company in a Post-Closing Tax Period or may be carried forward to
a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Buyer.

 

(d) _Tax Indemnification_.

indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and
against: (A) for any Post-Closing Tax Period (i) all Tax liabilities (which

expenses, attributable to such Tax liabilities) of the Transferred Companies
and (ii) all Tax liabilities (which shall include any costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to such Tax
liabilities) with respect to the Transferred Assets or the Business, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), other than any such Tax liabilities
that are Excluded Taxes, (B) all liability for Transfer Taxes for which Buyer
is responsible pursuant to Section 2.06(a), (C) all Tax liabilities (which

expenses, attributable to such Tax liabilities) attributable to a Buyer Tax
Act, unless such Buyer Tax Act is effected with the written consent of Seller
or (D) Tax liabilities (which shall include any costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to such Tax liabilities)
attributable to any breach by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the
Applicable Closing, any Transferred Company) of any covenant or other
agreement hereunder;

(v) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(i) The periodic Taxes of the Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling
Affiliates that are not based on income or receipts (e.g., property Taxes)
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed based upon the ratio of the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the
entire Tax period; and

 

(ii) Taxes of the Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling Affiliates for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than Taxes described in Section
7.08(d)(v)(i) above, shall be computed as if such Tax period ended as of the
close of business on the Applicable Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes
of the Transferred Companies and Seller and Selling  65

five (5) business days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are
required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

(vii) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Section 7.08(d) shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. Each party shall notify the other
party if it receives notice that any Taxing Authority proposes to treat any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Section 7.08(d) as other than an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, or if it otherwise
determines that an indemnification payment under this Section 7.08(d) is
required by applicable Tax Law to be treated as other than an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

(e) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) Buyer shall notify Seller within ten (10) business days of a Tax
Proceeding for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to a Transferred
Company, _provided_ that the failure to so notify Seller shall not affect
Sellers indemnification obligation under Section 7.08(d) except to the extent
of any material prejudice actually incurred by Seller. With respect to any
Tax Proceeding relating to (A) a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to a
Transferred Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business (other than a
Straddle Period or a Tax Proceeding with respect to a Transfer Tax) or (B)
a consolidated Tax Return of which Johnson and Johnson, Cordis Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries (other than a Transferred Company) is the common
parent, Seller may choose in its sole discretion (at its expense) to control
all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Proceeding (including selection of counsel), and, without limiting the
foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund or contest the Tax at issue
in such Tax Proceeding, _provided_ that, to the extent such Tax Proceeding or
the resolution or settlement thereof could have an impact on Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) after the Principal
Closing Date, (x) Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding and shall consult with
Buyer before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding and (y) Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent 66

 

 of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. With respect to
any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period with respect to a Transferred
Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business, Buyer may choose in its sole
discretion (at its expense) to control all proceedings and may make all
decisions taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of
counsel), and, without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion,
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its
sole discretion, either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a
refund or contest the Tax at issue in such Tax Proceeding, _provided_ that,
to the extent such Tax Proceeding or the resolution or settlement thereof
could have an impact on Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting in an increase of Sellers liability for
Taxes pursuant to this Agreement, (a) Buyer shall provide Seller with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding and shall
consult with Seller before taking any significant action in connection with
such Tax Proceeding and (b) Buyer shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.08(e)(i), Buyer shall
exclusively control all proceedings with respect to Taxes of the Transferred
Companies or Taxes otherwise relating to the Transferred Assets or the
Business. Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.06(d) or Section 7.08(e)(i) to
the contrary, Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control any Tax
Proceeding described in Section 2.06(d) or Section 7.08(e)(i) if Seller fails
to, or notifies Buyer in writing that Seller elects not to, defend such Tax
Proceeding.

 

(iii) Buyer, the Transferred Companies and each of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall cooperate in contesting any Tax Proceeding, which
cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to
the requesting party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax
Proceeding. Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 7.08(e).

 

(f) _Miscellaneous_.

 

(i) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

(1) Buyer and Seller shall join in timely making a valid election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or
local Tax Law) (a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to Cordis
Corporation. 67

 

(2) Neither Seller nor Buyer nor any of their respective Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) shall undertake any action or engage
in, or cause to be engaged in, any transaction that would jeopardize the
validity of the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

(3) Seller shall prepare and file all Section 338 Forms in accordance with
applicable Tax Laws and shall deliver a draft of such Section 338 Forms to
Buyer at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms
are required to be filed. Seller shall make any changes to such forms
reasonably requested by Buyer. Buyer shall execute and deliver to Seller such
Section 338 Forms (as amended) at least twenty (20) days prior to the date
such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Nothing in this Section
7.08(f)(i)(3) shall affect the rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller
under Section 2.05. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IRS Form 8023 shall be
filed on the date of the relevant Applicable Closing Date, and such date shall
be treated as the date such form is required to be filed for purposes of this
Section 7.08(f)(i)(3).

(4) Buyer and Seller agree to report the transfers under this Agreement
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law.

 

(ii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the other with such information
and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding of
the Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets or the Business for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period. Buyer shall, within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the end of the applicable Tax period, at Sellers cost
and expense, prepare, or cause the Transferred Companies to prepare, in
either case in a manner consistent with the Transferred Companies past
practices, all Tax work paper preparation packages necessary to enable Seller
to prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns that Seller is obligated
to prepare, or cause to be prepared, with respect to such Tax period under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall
not be required to provide Buyer with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the
contents of, any consolidated Tax Return and Buyer shall not be required to
provide Seller with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the contents of, any
consolidated Tax Return.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any
and all Taxes, any claims with respect to Taxes, and the procedures with
respect to claims for Taxes (in each case other than any Taxes referenced in,
described in, or governed by Section 3.13 or Article VIII) shall be governed
exclusively by this Section 7.08 and Sections 2.06(a)-(d) and 10.01 and 68

 

 shall not be governed by the provisions of Article X (other than Section
10.01), and for the avoidance of doubt, none of Annexes 2.02(a)-(d) shall
govern or apply to Tax assets or Tax liabilities.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before each Applicable Closing
Date all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar agreements or
arrangements (other than this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents),
if any, to which any of the Transferred Companies, on the one hand, and any
person (other than the Transferred Companies), on the other hand, are parties
to, and neither Buyer nor any of the Transferred Companies or their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligations thereunder after the Applicable
Closing.

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Buyer shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to, make an election under Section 338 of the Code with
respect to Japan NewCo (if Seller makes the election set forth in Section
2.02(i)). Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action that
would prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from making such an election.

(g) _Survival_. The obligation to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant
to Section 7.08(d) shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations except for such claims for indemnification
asserted prior to such date, which claims (and, if applicable, any
representation or warranty the breach of which gives rise to such claim) shall
survive until final resolution thereof.

 

SECTION 7.09. _Ancillary Agreements_. At the Principal Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit F_ (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ "), the Transition Manufacturing Services
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit G_ (the "
_Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement_ "), the Reverse Transition
Manufacturing Services and Access Agreement, substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Reverse Transition Manufacturing Services
and Access Agreement_ ") and the Trademark License Agreement, substantially
in the form attached as _Exhibit I_ (the " _Trademark License Agreement_ ").

 

SECTION 7.10. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Selling Affiliates have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action
required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and
the Selling Affiliates with the provisions of any bulk sale or bulk transfer
Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the Transactions.

SECTION 7.11. _Other Transaction Matters_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, comply with the applicable
obligations set forth on _Schedule 7.11_ to the Disclosure Letter. 69

 

SECTION 7.12. _Retained Claims_.

 

(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 7.12, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain complete control of any Retained Claim (including any
appeals thereof) with full authority to prosecute, defend or institute a new
lawsuit, counterclaim or other proceeding relating thereto, and Seller and its
Affiliates shall have the sole and exclusive right, at their own expense, to
settle or otherwise dispose of the same (in their sole discretion). Buyer will
provide reasonable cooperation (at Sellers request and expense) in such
prosecution, settlement or disposition, as applicable, including
providing reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Business to the extent related to the
Retained Claim; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates will not, in the
prosecution or defense of any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or
assessment, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, consent to the
entry of any Judgment or enter into any settlement (w) that restricts the
operations of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Business or a Transferred Company,
(x) admits liability or wrongdoing on the part of Buyer, its Affiliates, the
Business or a Transferred Company, (y) that grants any rights under or to any
Transferred Asset or (z) acknowledges the invalidity or unenforceability of
any Transferred IP. If a Transferred Company, Buyer or any of its Affiliates
is party to any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment related
to any Retained Defendant Liability, any settlement of the same shall include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Transferred Company, Buyer or such Affiliate, as applicable, a release from
all liability in respect thereof.

 

(b) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assign to, or
otherwise substitute for the applicable Transferred Company, Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller in any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or
assessment related to any Retained Claim; _provided_ that, if it is necessary
for a Transferred Company to remain a party to any such action, suit,
proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, or if any such assignment or
substitution would result in the dismissal of, or Seller or its Affiliates
waiving any defenses or forfeiting any rights or remedies or otherwise
materially prejudice Seller or its Affiliates in respect of, any Retained
Claim, then, notwithstanding Section 6.08, such Retained Claim shall not be
transferred out of the Transferred Companies and Seller shall not be obligated
to assign such Retained Claim or substitute itself or an Affiliate for the
applicable Transferred Company, and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable Transferred Company to continue to prosecute
or defend such Retained Claim at the direction of Seller; _provided_ that (a)
Seller shall remain responsible for such Retained Claim; and (b) neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred Company) shall be
required to take action pursuant to such prosecution or defense (w)
that restricts the operations of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Business or a
Transferred Company, (x) admits liability or wrongdoing on the part of Buyer,
its Affiliates, the Business or a Transferred Company, (y) that grants any
rights under or to any Transferred Asset or (z) acknowledges the invalidity
or unenforceability of any Transferred IP. 70

 

ARTICLE VIII __

 

 _Employees_

SECTION 8.01.  _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall consult with
Seller and obtain Sellers consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before distributing any communications to
any Employee of the Business whether relating to employee benefits, post-
Closing terms of employment or otherwise; _provided_ that this sentence shall
not apply to any (i) offer letters or other individual communications
regarding post-Closing employment of Employees of the Business (including
proposed terms of employment, compensation and employee benefits, or role and
organizational structure) or (ii) individual conversations or communications
regarding matters not covered by any of the Transaction Documents.

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than five (5) business days, after the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list on _Schedule 8.01(b)_ to
the Disclosure Letter containing an identification number, date of hire,
position, location, and base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity (and, in
no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, for sales employees, sales incentive targets, as well as actual
sales incentive paid during the prior fiscal year), outstanding equity awards
(including vesting schedule and exercise price, as applicable), expatriate
status and any additional information that is necessary for Buyer to
establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the Transfer Time,
as applicable, of each individual identified by Seller as expected to be an
Employee of the Business, and Seller shall update such information
periodically prior to the Applicable Closing Date to reflect new hires,
leaves of absence and employment terminations and any other material changes
thereto and provide copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer.

 

(c) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Applicable Closing by operation of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the
Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer, (i) Seller shall take, or cause its
respective Affiliates to take, all actions required in accordance with
applicable Law in respect of the transfer of employment of such Employees of
the Business to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and Seller shall encourage
each Employee of the Business to accept any offers of employment pursuant to
this Section 8.01(c) in its communications with such individuals; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be interpreted as
requiring Seller or any of its subsidiaries to provide any such Employee of
the Business with any additional compensation or benefits or otherwise incur
any material liability; (ii) in respect of Employees of the Business who are
principally employed in Mexico, such Employees of the Business will be
transferred to Buyer or one of its Affiliates as of the Applicable Closing
Date through "employer substitution mechanics," and (iii) except in respect of
Employees of the Business who are principally employed in Mexico, not less
than ten (10) business days prior to the Applicable Closing, Buyer or one of
its Affiliates will offer employment, effective at 11:59 P.M., local time, on
the Applicable Closing 71

 

 Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to such Employee of the Business in
accordance with this Agreement. Offers pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) shall
(A) be for a position commensurate with the skills and experience of such
Employee of the Business and at a geographic work location within fifty (50)
miles of the applicable Employee of the Business primary work location
immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date (or, to the extent
applicable in jurisdictions other than the United States, within such lesser
radius as is necessary to ensure severance is not due in connection with such
relocation), and (B) otherwise comply in all respects with applicable Law
(including with respect to compensation and benefits). With respect to any
Employee of the Business to whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates is required to
make an offer of employment pursuant to this Section 8.01(c), and who, as of
the Applicable Closing Date, is on approved leave of absence from work with
Seller or its Affiliates (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "), Buyer shall offer
employment to such individual on the earliest practicable date following the
return of such individual to work with Seller and its Affiliates and otherwise
on terms and conditions consistent with this Section 8.01; _provided_ that
such employee returns to work within one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Applicable Closing Date or such later time as required by
applicable Law or the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement
upon presenting themselves for duty to the Business. Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer of the occurrence and end of any such leave of absence. In the
case of any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee following the
Applicable Closing Date, all references in this Agreement to (1) the
Applicable Closing Date shall be deemed to be references to the date on which
such individual becomes a Transferred Employee and (2) the Transfer Time shall
be deemed to be references to 11:59 P.M., local time, on the date that such
individual becomes a Transferred Employee. In any jurisdiction where the
employment of an Employee of the Business can transfer automatically to Buyer
and its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Applicable Closing by operation
of Law or pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests to
Buyer, Buyer and Seller agree to take, or cause their respective Affiliates to
take, all actions required under applicable Law and all other actions as are
necessary or appropriate such that the employment of such Employee of the
Business will transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates automatically as of the
Transfer Time.

(d) Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the
Selling Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the
Business for any statutory or common law severance or other separation
benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any
other legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable
during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a
Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the parties) and for any other
claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation,
benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of (i) Buyers breach of its
obligations under this Article VIII or (ii) any claims for severance or other
separation benefits in connection with the involuntary termination of
employment by Buyer or its Affiliates of any Transferred Employee after the
Transfer Time. Seller or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities,
obligations and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the
Business for any statutory or common law severance or other
separation benefits, any contractual or 72

 

 other severance or separation benefits and any other legally mandated
payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a mandatory
termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a Judgment of a court
having jurisdiction over the parties) and for any other claim, cost, liability
or obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in
each case, not arising out of Buyers breach of its obligations under this
Article VIII or under clause (ii) above, including without limitation, any
such claim that arising out of (A) the applicable Employee of the Business
refusal to accept an offer of employment made in compliance with this Article
VIII from (or to commence employment with), or objection to the automatic
transfer of employment to, Buyer or its Affiliates, and (B) any claims made by
any Employee of the Business in China or other jurisdictions for any
statutory severance or other separation benefits (including statutory economic
compensation and statutory compensation payable in respect of accrued but not
yet taken vacation days or other paid time off for the calendar year in which
the Applicable Closing Date occurs) that arise as a result of any such
employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates making a request that such severance or other separation benefits
be paid or provided by Seller or any of its subsidiaries. Buyer shall not
encourage any Employee of the Business regarding a request described in the
immediately preceding sentence, and in the event an Employee of the Business
asks Buyer a question regarding such request, Buyer shall refer such Employee
of the Business to an applicable representative of Seller with respect to such
request.

(e) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, Buyer or its Affiliates (i) shall provide to each
Transferred Employee a total compensation opportunity and employee benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect for such
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date;
_provided_ that Buyer shall provide such Transferred Employee no less
favorable base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity, as applicable, than
as set forth on _Schedule 8.01(b)_ to the Disclosure Letter; and (ii) shall
provide each Transferred Employee an office within a commute of no more than
50 miles from his or her office as of immediately prior to the Applicable
Closing Date; _provided_ that if a relocation beyond that distance is required
and such Transferred Employees employment terminates as a result of his or
her desire not to accept such a relocation, such Transferred Employee shall
receive the severance benefits at the level set forth in Section 8.01(f).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring either Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue
the employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee for any period after the
Applicable Closing Date; _provided_ that such employee shall receive the
severance benefits set forth in Section 8.01(f) if terminated under the
circumstances described therein.

(f) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, in the event of a termination of any Transferred
Employees employment by Buyer or its Affiliates without cause (as reasonably
determined by Buyer or its Affiliate), Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide
severance benefits to such Transferred Employee that are no less
favorable than those severance or termination benefits applicable to such
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date;
_provided_ that such severance benefits shall be provided only if the
Transferred Employee executes (and does not revoke) a release of claims in
favor of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer. 73

 

(g) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (the " _Buyer Plans_
"), service with Seller and the Selling Affiliates prior to the Transfer Time
to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Listed Plan
covering such Transferred Employees, including for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit levels and accruals, in each case, except (x) where it
would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) with respect to newly
established Buyer Plans that do not provide credit for past service to such
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates and in which at least
a comparable number of similarly situated of employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Employees or newly hired
employees) participate, (ii) waive any preexisting condition exclusion,
actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and
other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, except to the extent
such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period would
have applied to such individual under the corresponding Listed Plan, and (iii)
provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made
or incurred prior to the Transfer Time for the plan year in which the
Applicable Closing occurs.

(h) If permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall pay to the Transferred
Employees (i) all accrued but unpaid vacation for periods prior to the
Transfer Time, and (ii) all base salary, wages, commissions or other amounts
(but not including any annual bonuses or incentives) in respect of services
performed by each Employee of the Business for Seller or its Affiliates that
are earned and accrued but unpaid as of the Transfer Time, as applicable, in
each case, to be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the
Transfer Time or as required by law, but in no event later than thirty (30)
business days after the Transfer Time. If, under applicable Law, Seller cannot
pay the amounts described in the preceding sentence to Transferred Employees,
Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any such amounts that Buyer pays to such
Transferred Employees. Buyer will cooperate in good faith with Transferred
Employees with respect to vacation commitments purchased or reserved by such
Transferred Employees prior to the applicable Transfer Time in respect of
periods occurring subsequent to such applicable Transfer Time; it being
understood that any such vacation commitments ultimately honored by Buyer
shall count against the applicable Transferred Employees paid time off
accrued during his or her service with Buyer or be unpaid.

(i) Subject to Seller providing all reasonably necessary support and
information in a timely manner, no later than the Applicable Closing Date,
Buyer shall establish or cause to be established (or utilize existing Buyer
Plans), at its own expense, all necessary retirement, pension, employee
welfare and employee benefit plans for Transferred Employees, as applicable.
Effective as of the Transfer Time, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be
an employee of Seller or the applicable Affiliate  74

 

 and shall cease to participate in any Business Employee Benefit Plan (other
than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee. Other than with respect
to a government-sponsored benefit plan, (i) Seller shall be, or shall cause
its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or
his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, (C) claims for group
life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance
benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (D) claims relating to
COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any
Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents, in each
case, prior to or as of the Transfer Time and (ii) Buyer shall be, or shall
cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental
and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee
or his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, (C) claims for group
life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance
benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (D) claims relating
to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any
Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents, in each
case, after the Transfer Time. Except in the event of any claim for workers
compensation benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims
and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical,
vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital
expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising
any such benefits and (2) short and long-term disability, life, accidental
death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon
the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. Seller
and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Transfer Time by any
Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after
the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers
compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred on the date the injury
giving rise to the claim occurs. 

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.01 to the contrary,
with respect to each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, during the applicable
Benefits Continuation Period, or such longer period required by applicable
Law, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide to such employees terms and
conditions of employment (including seniority and other service credit)
that individually, are no less than as required by applicable Law, and in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) amounts (and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, types) of compensation and benefits
(including severance and equity compensation benefits) that, individually, are
no less than as required by applicable Law and, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those provided by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior
to the Transfer Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may satisfy its
obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence by providing cash payments or
other benefits in lieu of equity compensation benefits. Without limiting the
generality of Section 8.01 or Buyers obligations hereunder, with respect to
Transferred Employees covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements, effective
from and after the Transfer Time, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall comply
with applicable Law concerning Collective Bargaining Agreements in the context
of this Agreement. 75

 

(k) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Time (and Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer any such permit, pass or other approval to Buyer, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and to cooperate with Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate with respect to any ongoing approval processes).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
any Collective Bargaining Agreement, in the event an applicable work permit
for an Employee of the Business is not in place with Buyer or its Affiliate
as of the Transfer Time, such Employee of the Business shall be treated as an
Inactive Employee hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the applicable work permit; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Seller shall not be obligated to provide for the services of such Employee of
the Business to be made available to Buyer or any substitute for such
services.

(l) As of the Transfer Time, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates
copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee required to be
provided to Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable Law or as necessary for
Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the
Transfer Time. Seller shall be permitted to retain copies of such employment
records, except where prohibited by applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates
shall ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the
employment of such Transferred Employee or as otherwise permitted by
applicable Law.

(m) To the extent applicable, the parties hereto acknowledge the application
of the European Council Directive of March 12, 2001 (2001/23/EC) (the "
_Directive_ "), relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event
of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and any
country legislation implementing the Directive and any other similar Law
(collectively, the " _Transfer Regulations_ "). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that they shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
comply with the Transfer Regulations to the extent applicable.

(n) Seller and its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, costs and
obligations relating to any claim or potential claim that is a benefit
payable to a Transferred Employee under any Major Market Plan that is a
defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom has transferred to and is a
liability of Buyer or its Affiliates (including as a result of the transfer
of the Transferred Equity Interests to Buyer and including, for the avoidance
of doubt, all such liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that exist as of the
Applicable Closing Date). 76

 

(o) In the United States, pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Buyer and
Seller and their respective Affiliates shall apply the "standard" method for
purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to any Employee of the
Business.

 

(p) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any Employee of the Business or of any other employee benefit
plan.

(q) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, references to
the "Applicable Closing" and "Applicable Closing Date" in this Section 8.01
shall be deemed to mean, with respect to (i) any Employee of the Business at
the Juarez Facility (as defined in the Transition Manufacturing Services
Agreement) who works on a production line used to manufacture the Products
(the " _Juarez Line Employees_ "), the time and date, as applicable, of the
Line Transfer in respect of such production line and (ii) any other Employee
of the Business at the Juarez Facility (a "Juarez Non-Line Employee", and
together with the Juarez Line Employees, the " _Juarez Employees_ "), the time
and date, as applicable, of the Non-Line Role Transfer in respect of such
Juarez Non-Line Employee, each as set forth (and defined) in Schedule 7.11 to
the Disclosure Letter, and in each case to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with applicable Law. Seller and Buyer shall cause the employment
of each Juarez Employee to transfer from Seller and its Affiliates to Buyer
and its Affiliates through "employer substitution mechanics" as required by
Mexican Federal Labor Law at the applicable time set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence in accordance with this Section 8.01 and through the
delivery to each of such Juarez Employees of a notice of employer substitution
to be furnished to them by Seller and Buyer (directly or through the
local Conciliation and Arbitration Board) on the Applicable Closing Date.

of the jurisdictions specified on _Schedule 5.01(f)_ to the Disclosure
Letter, (y) the condition in Section 5.01(f) and (z) the condition in Section

to materiality (including specific monetary thresholds) contained or
incorporated in any such representation or warranty, but such qualifications,
to the extent contained or incorporated in any such representation or
warranty, shall apply for the purposes of determining whether any such
inaccuracy or breach has occurred.

(d) The right of the Indemnitees to seek indemnification pursuant to this
Article X shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that,
based on any facts or circumstances known, or that should have been known, to
Seller, Buyer or any other Indemnitee, including from any investigation made
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, the information provided in the
Management Presentation, the Data Room or given in writing to such Indemnitee
prior to the date of this Agreement (except, for the avoidance of doubt, any
disclosure of any fact or item in any portion to the Disclosure Letter), such
Indemnitee or any of its representatives knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

 

SECTION 10.05. _Claims_. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, proceeding, assessment, fact or other  81

 

 circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a " _Claim_ ")
hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim
and only to the extent known to such Indemnified Party, such facts and
information as are then reasonably available, including the estimated amount
of Damages and the specific basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure to
give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying
Partys obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions_. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim by any third party within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of notice of such Claim by the Indemnifying Party,
with full authority to conduct such defense, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate in such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
will (a) permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such defense,
settlement or disposal through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party
(provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such
Indemnified Party) and (b) not, in defense of any such Claim, except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement (i) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages, (ii) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof and/or
(iii) which includes any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
any third-party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any
settlement of such Claim for the payment of monetary damages unless (A) the
Indemnified Party consents in writing to such settlement or (B) the
Indemnifying Party confirms in writing to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will be responsible for indemnifying the Indemnified Party
for the Damages resulting from such Claim, to the extent provided in (and
subject to the parameters of) this Article X. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any third-party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnified Party if such third-party Claim (x) seeks an
injunction or other equitable or non-monetary relief against the Indemnified
Party (other than equitable or non-monetary relief that is incidental to
monetary damages as the primary relief sought) and not also against the
Indemnifying Party or (y) is related to or otherwise arises in connection with
any criminal matter, in which case the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in such defense
with its own counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding an election by
the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any third-party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ one separate co-counsel and
to participate in the defense in such action or proceeding, and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such separate counsel, if, based on advice from counsel, there exists any
actual or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the third-party Claim. In
any event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their
respective counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any third-party Claim
subject to this Article X and keep each other informed of all significant 82

 

 developments relating to any such third-party Claim, and provide copies of
all relevant correspondence and documentation relating thereto. In all
circumstances, the Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

SECTION 10.07. _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery_. No Claim for
indemnification for a breach of any representation or warranty shall be made
or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written
notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable representation or warranty pursuant to Section 10.01. This Article
X, Section 6.07(a), Section 7.01(b), Section 7.08(d), Section 8.01(d)
and Section 8.01(q) provide the exclusive means by which a party may assert
and remedy claims for monetary relief pursuant to this Agreement following the
Principal Closing Date, including any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and Section 11.12 provides
the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions against the other party
under this Agreement. With respect to any Damages arising under this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such Damages from Seller and
the Selling Affiliates, and Buyer hereby waives the right to seek Damages from
or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Selling Affiliates) or any director, officer or
employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates); _provided_ that such
limitations shall not apply in connection with claims for successor liability
or fraudulent conveyance. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be
entitled to indemnification under this Article X with respect to any matter to
the extent that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment
to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to Section 2.04. For the avoidance of
doubt, the indemnification obligations of Buyer and Seller in respect of the
allocation of Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities shall not govern
the allocation of responsibility for liabilities between Buyer and Seller and
their respective Affiliates in respect of any future commercial arrangements
unrelated to this Agreement between the parties, such matters being addressed
in the terms thereof.

 

SECTION 10.08. _Calculation of Damages_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from
third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party
the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), solely to avoid
duplicative recovery for the same Damage, but not in excess of any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

SECTION 10.09. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law. 83

 

ARTICLE XI __

 

 _Miscellaneous_

SECTION 11.01. _No Additional Representations_. Buyer is relying, in addition
to the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, on its own investigation,
examination and valuation of the Business, including the Transferred Assets,
in effecting the transactions covered by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Buyer is purchasing the Transferred Assets based on the
results of its inspections and investigations and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, and not on any representation or warranty of Seller or
any of its Affiliates not expressly set forth in this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 11.02. _Financial Information and Projections_. In connection
with Buyers investigation of the Business, Buyer has received from Seller
various forward-looking statements regarding the Business (including the
estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it)
(the " _Forward-Looking Statements_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i)
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the Forward-Looking
Statements; (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; and (iii)
that Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statement.

SECTION 11.03. _To the knowledge_. "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means the
actual knowledge of those individuals set forth on _Schedule 11.03(a)_ to the
Disclosure Letter. "To the knowledge of Buyer" or other references to the
knowledge or awareness of Buyer or its Affiliates means the actual knowledge
of those individuals set forth on _Schedule 11.03(b)_ to the Disclosure
Letter.

 

SECTION 11.04. _Waivers_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Applicable Closing, the parties hereto may by written agreement signed by
both parties, (a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the
performance of any obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or statement of any
party hereto or (c) waive any condition or compliance with any covenant
contained in this Agreement. The failure of a party hereto to require
performance of any provision hereof at any time shall in no manner affect such
partys right at a later time to enforce such provision. No waiver in any one
or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

SECTION 11.05. _Modifications and Amendments_. This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto. 84

 

SECTION 11.06. _Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement_.
(a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but this Agreement shall not be assignable
by either party hereto without the express written consent of the other party
hereto, which will not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ that, without such
consent, either party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder (in
whole but not in part) to an Affiliate at any time (but no such assignment
shall relieve such assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement),
or to a third party in connection with a sale or transfer (by means of a
merger, stock sale or otherwise) of all or substantially all of such partys
