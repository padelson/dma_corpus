10.07. <U>Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery</U>. No Claim for indemnification for a breach of any representation or warranty shall be made or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such Claim
to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable representation or warranty pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.01. This Article&nbsp;X, Section&nbsp;6.07(a), Section&nbsp;7.01(b), Section&nbsp;7.08(d), Section&nbsp;8.01(d) and
Section&nbsp;8.01(q) provide the exclusive means by which a party may assert and remedy claims for monetary relief pursuant to this Agreement following the Principal Closing Date, including any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, and Section&nbsp;11.12 provides the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions against the other party under this Agreement. With respect to any Damages arising under this Agreement, Buyer agrees that
it shall only seek such Damages from Seller and the Selling Affiliates, and Buyer hereby waives the right to seek Damages from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Selling Affiliates) or
any director, officer or employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates); <U>provided</U> that such limitations shall not apply in connection with claims for successor liability or fraudulent conveyance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this Article&nbsp;X with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price, if any, pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.04. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations of Buyer and Seller in respect of the allocation of Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities shall not govern the allocation of
responsibility for liabilities between Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates in respect of any future commercial arrangements unrelated to this Agreement between the parties, such matters being addressed in the terms thereof. </P>

subsequently recovers from third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article&nbsp;X, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the
amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), solely to avoid duplicative recovery for the same Damage, but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SECTION 10.09. <U>Tax Treatment of Indemnity
