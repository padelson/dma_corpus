shall at the Effective Time be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive either (A) in the case of a share of
Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive a share of
NewCo Class A Common Stock (a " _Share Election_ ") has been properly made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 2.7_ (each, a " _Share Electing
Share_ "), one (1) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") share of NewCo Class A Common
Stock (the " _Share Consideration"_ ), or (B) in the case of a share of
Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "
_Cash Election"_ ) has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ (each, a " _Cash Electing Share_ ), $8.50 in cash (the "Per
Share Cash Amount" and, together with the Share Consideration, the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest (the " _Cash Consideration"_
) ((A) and (B) together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of NewCo
Class A Common Stock as specified below, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in
each case subject to _Section 2.8_. All of the shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall no longer be

 



       
 

 



 

outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ , as well as any dividends or
other distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(b) _Dissenting Shares_. No right to fair value or appraisal or similar rights
shall be available to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_ ), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or NewCo Class A Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio and
the Per Share Cash Amount shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall prohibit
any action by IAC, NewCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be taken
pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of NewCo. Each holder of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of NewCo Class A Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares evidenced by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive from the Exchange Agent, in lieu thereof and upon
surrender thereof, a cash payment (without interest) in an amount representing
such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders of NewCo Class A Common Stock
that would otherwise be issued.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to Effective Time, IAC
shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for NewCo, the identity and the terms of appointment of
which to be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the
Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the
Exchange Agents responsibilities with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, IAC shall
deposit or cause NewCo to deposit with the Exchange Agent evidence of NewCo
Class A Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such
NewCo Class A Common Stock, at IACs election) representing the number of
shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_
and cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to deliver the
aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ ) (such cash and shares,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing Date, NewCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
IAC and the Company may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time)
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.3(d)_.

 



 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with either a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days, following the later to occur of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement together with any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.3(d)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company,
any cash to be paid upon, or shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock to be issued
upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the
case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent,

 



      
 

 



 

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ , each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into
which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to NewCo Class A
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ until such holder shall surrender such share
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. After the surrender in accordance with
this _Section 2.3_ of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into
shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ , the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Merger
Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this _Article II_ ) any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the share of NewCo Class A
Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of NewCo
Class A Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_ (together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ ), without interest, and (ii) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company, NewCo
or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by IAC; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ ,
and following any losses from any such investment, IAC shall promptly provide
or cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit

 



      
 

 



 

of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to NewCo, upon demand.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to NewCo, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to NewCo or the Surviving Company (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. None of IAC, NewCo, the Company, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the
Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions to be paid in
accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second anniversary of the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger
Consideration or any such dividends or distributions would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, NewCo and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this _Article II_ such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
and, if required by NewCo or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as NewCo or the Exchange Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to _Section 2.3(g)_ , NewCo) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends
and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Option_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option
(each, a " _NewCo Option_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of NewCo
Class A Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the
product determined by multiplying (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at a per-share exercise price, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as set forth in this _Section 2.4(a)_ , each NewCo
Option converted and assumed pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the
corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, following the Effective Time, any NewCo Option
corresponding to a Company Option that was subject to performance-based
vesting criteria shall continue to be subject to the existing performance
periods and the applicable performance goals will be adjusted based on the
Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(b) _Company RSU Awards_. Each award of restricted stock units that
corresponds to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU Award_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of
the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a NewCo restricted stock unit award (each, a
" _NewCo RSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of NewCo Class A
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of
the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying any June 2016 PBRSU Award shall be determined assuming
satisfaction of the "Adjusted EBITDA" goal and satisfaction of the "Cumulative
Total Revenue Goal" (each, as set forth in the applicable award agreement) at
the target performance level. Except as set forth in this _Section 2.4(b)_ ,
each NewCo RSU Award assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as
applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, following the Effective Time,
(i) the June 2016 PBRSU Awards shall vest solely on the basis of service
following the Effective Time, and (ii) the CEO PBRSU Award shall continue to
be subject to the existing performance periods and the applicable performance
goals will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of
Directors and/or an appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions
providing for, and take all other actions necessary to effectuate, the
treatment of the Company Options and Company RSUs (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.4(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Awards Assumed by NewCo_. At the Effective Time, NewCo shall assume all
the obligations of the Company under the Company Equity Plans, each NewCo

 



      
 

 



 

Option and NewCo RSU Award, and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof,
and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each Company
Equity Plan shall be adjusted to reflect shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Company Equity Plan.

 



 

(e) _SEC Filing_. No later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective
Time, NewCo shall file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4
or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) relating to the shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock issuable with
respect to each NewCo Option and each NewCo RSU Award assumed and converted by
NewCo in accordance with this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP
that are necessary to provide that: (a) with respect to the offering period
commencing on May 1st (the " _Company ESPP Offering Period_ "), (i) no
employee who is not enrolled in the Company ESPP on the date of this Agreement
may participate in the Company ESPP and (ii) no participant may increase the
percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect
on the date of this Agreement for such Company ESPP Offering Period; (b)
subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate,
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; (c) if the Company ESPP
Offering Period is scheduled to end prior to the date that is five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, then following the purchase of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Company ESPP Offering Period, the Company ESPP
shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under the
Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time; and (d) if the Company ESPP Offering
Period has not ended as of the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Effective
Time, then on such day, any then-outstanding rights under the Company ESPP
shall be exercised.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, IAC or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then IAC, NewCo, Merger Sub,
the Company and the Surviving Company and their respective officers and
directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than any Cancelled Shares and any shares of Company Common
Stock held by any of the Companys Subsidiaries) (each, a " _Holder_ ") shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article II_ , to
submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.7_ (an " _Election"_ ) (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Share Election, (ii) the number of such shares of Company
Common Stock with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election
and (iii) the particular shares for which the Holder

 



      
 

 



 

desires to make either such election, and the order in which either such
election is to apply to any such shares if the election is subject to
proration under _Section 2.8_. Any share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed
Form of Election on or before the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be
Share Electing Shares.

 



 

(b) The Company shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to IAC (the " _Form
of Election"_ ), which shall be mailed by the Company to Holders so as to
permit such Holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the
Election Deadline.

 



 

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable,
the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Election Deadline. The Company shall make available one or more
Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
persons who become Holders during the period following the record date for the
Company Special Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline.

 



 

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by (i) the Certificates, if any, to which
such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company, and (ii) in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set
forth in the Form of Election. As used herein, " _Election Deadline_ " means
5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Company and IAC, in which event the
Company shall reasonably promptly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline.

 



 

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke such Holders Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
such Holders Certificates, or any documents in respect of Book-Entry Shares,
previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly
made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, any subsequent
transfer of such shares of shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically
revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by
the Exchange Agent of written notification from the Company or IAC that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_. The Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not
properly made with respect to any share of Company Common Stock (none of the
Company, IAC, NewCo, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent being under any duty to
notify any Company stockholder of any such defect). In the event the Exchange
Agent makes such a determination, such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall,
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Share Electing Shares, unless a proper
Election is thereafter timely made with respect to such shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Company and IAC, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall
have the joint right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the DGCL, governing the manner and extent to which
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed
by _Section 2.8_.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Proration_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the number of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration exceed the number of shares (rounded
to the nearest whole number) equal to the result obtained by dividing
$130,000,000 by the Per Share Cash Amount (such number of shares, the " _Cash
Cap Number_ ").

 



 

(b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares (such number, the " _Cash
Election Number_ ") is less than or equal to the Cash Cap Number, then (i) all
Cash Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and (ii) all Share Electing Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Share Consideration.

 



 

(c) If the Cash Election Number exceeds the Cash Cap Number, then (i) all
Share Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share
Consideration and (ii) the number of Cash Electing Shares of each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock that shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Cash Electing Shares of such holder by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Cap Number and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Number, rounded to the nearest whole share of
Company Common Stock, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Electing
Shares each being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Determination of IAC Class B Share Number_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all such action as is necessary to ensure that no
Company Options may be exercised from 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date through the Effective Time. IAC
shall take all such action as is necessary to ensure that no HomeAdvisor SARS
may be exercised from 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the third (3rd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date through the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) On (but prior to 7:00 p.m., Eastern time, on) the second (2nd) Business
Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date:

 



 

(i) the Company shall deliver to IAC a certificate, executed on its behalf by
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, setting forth the ANGI Outstanding
Share Number and the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares, and attaching a
schedule setting forth, as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the second (2nd)
Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Equity Measurement
Time_ "), (A) with respect to each Company Option, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Company Option and the
exercise price per share of such Company Option, and (B) with respect to each
Company RSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Company RSU (in the case of

 



      
 

 



 

June 2016 PBRSU Awards, determined in accordance with _Section 2.4_ of this
Agreement) and identifying each Company RSU Award that is scheduled to vest
between the Equity Measurement Time and the anticipated Effective Time; and

 



 

(ii) IAC shall deliver to the Company a certificate, executed on its behalf by
the Chief Financial Officer of IAC, setting forth the IAC Owned Shares Number
and attaching a schedule setting forth, as of the Equity Measurement Time,
with respect to each HomeAdvisor SAR, the number of HomeAdvisor Shares covered
by such HomeAdvisor SAR and the exercise price per share of such HomeAdvisor
SAR, the portion of such HomeAdvisor SAR that is vested or unvested as of the
Equity Measurement Time and the portion of each HomeAdvisor SAR that is
scheduled to vest between the Equity Measurement Time and the anticipated
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) The information set forth in the certificates and schedules contemplated
by paragraph (b) above shall be used to make the calculations contemplated by
paragraph (d) below; _provided_ , that, in the event IAC or the Company shall
dispute any information set forth in the certificate delivered to it by the
other party or the schedule enclosed therewith, IAC and the Company shall in
good faith resolve such dispute, and the information set forth in such
certificates and schedules, as modified (if applicable) to reflect any such
resolved dispute(s), shall be used to make such calculations.

 



 

(d) Promptly following 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the Business Day prior to
the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Initial Calculation Date_ "), IAC shall
calculate and shall deliver to the Company a certificate executed on its
behalf by the Chief Financial Officer of IAC setting forth the calculation of
the ANGI Market Price, the ANGI RSU Number, the Aggregate ANGI Option Spread,
the IAC Owned Shares Number, the Allocated HomeAdvisor SAR Spread and the IAC
Class B Share Number. Absent manifest error, the IAC Class B Share Number set
forth in the certificate contemplated by this paragraph (d) shall be the
conclusive determination of the IAC Class B Share Number for purposes of the
IAC Share Issuance.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment of IAC Class B Share Number_.

 



 

(a) Within two (2) Business Days after the date that is the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, NewCo shall deliver to IAC a certificate,
executed on its behalf by the Chief Financial Officer of NewCo, setting forth
the Actual Forfeited Shares Number and its calculation of the Adjusted IAC
Class B Share Number and the Class B Adjustment Number and shall include a
schedule supporting the calculation of the Actual Forfeited Shares Number, the
Adjusted IAC Class B Share Number and the Class B Adjustment Number. The
calculations of the Actual Forfeited Shares Number, the Adjusted IAC Class B
Share Number and the Class B Adjustment Number shall have been reviewed by the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of NewCo.

 



 

(b) Within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the certificate to IAC by
NewCo as set forth in _Section 2.10(a)_ (the date of delivery, the " _Delivery
Date_ "), (i) if the Class B Adjustment Number is a positive number, NewCo
shall take all necessary action to issue to IAC a number of shares of NewCo
Class B Common Stock equal to the Class B Adjustment Number and to have such
issuance duly recorded in the transfer books of NewCo (which shares,

 



      
 

 



 

upon issuance, shall be fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear of all
Liens), and (ii) if the Class B Adjustment Number is a negative number, the
absolute value of such number of shares of NewCo Class B Common Stock held by
IAC shall be cancelled and returned to NewCo to be held in treasury, and NewCo
shall take all necessary action to have such cancellation duly recorded in the
transfer books of NewCo. If the Class B Adjustment Number is zero, NewCo shall
have no obligation to issue any additional shares of NewCo Class B Common
Stock to IAC in respect of the previous sentence. For the avoidance of doubt,
IAC shall not be required to make any payment to NewCo in connection with any
issuance by NewCo to IAC of shares of NewCo Class B Common Stock equal to the

recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Additional Class B
Issuance Number (and each of the share amounts that are necessary to calculate

accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley

operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
report financial information and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, in each case,

(a) None of the forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished
by IAC and its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement by them with
the SEC since January 1, 2015 (all such documents and reports filed or
furnished by IAC or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _IAC SEC Documents_ ") at
the time they were filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a
material fact with respect to the HomeAdvisor Business or omitted to state any
material fact with respect to the HomeAdvisor Business required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business set forth in _Section
4.4(b)_ of the IAC Disclosure Letter (a) (i) as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2016 (collectively referred to as the " _HomeAdvisor
Annual Financial Statements_ ") were derived from the books and records of IAC
and financial data used in the preparation of the audited financial statements
of IAC as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 and (ii) as of
and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 (the " _HomeAdvisor
Interim Financial Statements_ " and, together with the HomeAdvisor Annual
Financial Statements, the " _HomeAdvisor Financial Statements_ ") were derived
from the books and records of IAC and financial data used in the preparation
of the unaudited financial statements of IAC as of and for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2017, (b) are unaudited, (c) were prepared solely for
the purpose of this Agreement, (d) were based on (i) the direct operating
revenues and direct operating expenses of the HomeAdvisor Business and (ii)
allocations to the HomeAdvisor Business, made based on reasonable assumptions
and in good faith by management, of certain of the indirect costs previously
allocated by the management of IAC to the HomeAdvisor Business in the course
of preparing IACs publicly filed segment level financial information, (e) do
not include indirect costs that are not allocated to IACs businesses in the
course of preparing IACs publicly filed segment level financial information,
(f) were prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved, except for (i) the absence of notes, (ii) the income tax
provisions and the related income taxes payable and deferred income tax
accounts, which have been recorded based on an allocation of IACs income tax
liability arising from the operations of the HomeAdvisor Entities (and not in
accordance with GAAP on a stand-alone basis for the HomeAdvisor Entities) and
a portion of which have been recorded at the IAC level, (iii) the absence of
stock-based compensation expense for grants of equity awards denominated in
the equity of the HomeAdvisor Entities or IAC to employees of the HomeAdvisor
Entities, and (g) fairly present in accordance with GAAP, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of each
of the HomeAdvisor Entities as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein, except as

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise noted therein and for the impact of items referred to in (d), (e)
and (f) above, and, subject to (A) the fact that the HomeAdvisor Business was
not operated on a stand-alone basis during such periods and (B) the fact that
the HomeAdvisor Financial Statements (and the allocations and estimations made
by the management of IAC in preparing such HomeAdvisor Financial Statements)
(1) are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have resulted if
the HomeAdvisor Business had been operated on a stand-alone basis during such
periods, (2) may not be indicative of any such costs to NewCo and its
Subsidiaries that will result following the Closing and (3) subject, in the
case of the HomeAdvisor Interim Financial Statements, to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments that will not, individually or in the aggregate, be
material. Except for those representations and warranties contained in this
_Section 4.4(b)_, IAC makes no other representations or warranties with
regard to the HomeAdvisor Financial Statements.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by IAC
relating to the IAC SEC Documents. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the IAC SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of IAC, the subject of ongoing SEC
review or investigation.

 



 

(d) None of NewCo or the HomeAdvisor Entities is a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among NewCo or a HomeAdvisor Entity, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other
hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of NewCo or a HomeAdvisor Entity in the HomeAdvisor
Financial Statements.

 



 

(e) When delivered pursuant to _Section 5.20_, the Audited Financial
Statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved, and shall present fairly in all
material respects the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of the HomeAdvisor Business as at the dates and for the periods presented (it
being understood, however, that the HomeAdvisor Business has not been
operating historically as a separate "standalone" entity and, therefore, the
Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements of
the HomeAdvisor Business will reflect certain adjustments necessary to be
presented on a stand-alone basis in accordance with GAAP and SEC
requirements). The Audited Financial Statements as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2016 will not differ from the HomeAdvisor Annual
Financial Statements in any material and adverse respect.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. IAC has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. IACs disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by IAC in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all

 



      
 

 



 

such material information is accumulated and communicated to IACs management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. IACs management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the IACs internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
management of IAC has disclosed to IACs auditors and the audit committee of
the IAC Board of Directors (i) any "significant deficiencies" and "material
weaknesses" (as both terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board Interim Standard AU 325 Parts 2 and 3) in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect IACs ability to report
financial information and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in IACs
internal control over financial reporting, in each case, that was disclosed to
IACs auditors or the audit committee of the IAC Board of Directors in
connection with its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the HomeAdvisor Entities or the HomeAdvisor Business, whether
accrued, absolute, determined or contingent, except for (i) liabilities or
obligations disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the most recent
balance sheet included in the HomeAdvisor Financial Statements, (ii)
liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
HomeAdvisor Transaction Documents, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2016, (iv) liabilities
for Taxes and (v) liabilities or obligations that have not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
HomeAdvisor Material Adverse Effect. Other than liabilities and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or incurred in connection herewith or
therewith (including Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Contribution
Agreement)), there are no material liabilities or obligations of NewCo,
whether accrued, absolute, determined or contingent.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Law_.

 



 

(a) NewCo, the HomeAdvisor Entities and, with respect to the HomeAdvisor
Business, IAC are and have been since January 1, 2015 in compliance with, and
are not in default under or in violation of, any Law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation has not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a HomeAdvisor Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2015, neither IAC, a HomeAdvisor Entity nor
NewCo has received any written notice or, to the knowledge of IAC, other
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any violation by NewCo,
any HomeAdvisor Entity or the HomeAdvisor Business of, or failure by NewCo,

Section 5.2 _Access_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of facilitating the transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Ancillary Agreements, each of the Company and IAC shall afford (i) the
officers and employees and (ii) the accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors and agents and other representatives of the other party
such reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice,
throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, in the case of the Company, to its and its Subsidiaries,
and in the case of IAC, to the HomeAdvisor Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries, respective personnel and properties, contracts, commitments,
books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed or received
by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional
accounting, financing, operating, environmental and other data and information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries or the HomeAdvisor Entities and
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as the Company and IAC may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither IAC nor the Company
shall be required to provide access to or make available to any person any
document or information that, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (i)
violates any of its or its Subsidiaries obligations with respect to
confidentiality, (ii) is subject to any attorney-client, work-product or other
legal privilege or (iii) the disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

of which would violate any Law or legal duty ( _provided_ that the withholding
party will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of such
privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into appropriate common
interest or similar agreements) _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein
shall authorize IAC or its Representatives to undertake any environmental
testing or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the
Company or its Subsidiaries and nothing herein shall authorize the Company or
its respective Representatives to undertake any environmental testing or
sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by IAC or its
Subsidiaries. Each of IAC and the Company agrees that prior to the Closing it
will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_ for any competitive or other
purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Ancillary Agreements. Each of the Company and IAC will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of the other party that may result from requests for access.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements shall be governed in
accordance with the confidential disclosure agreement, dated as of December 9,
2016, between the Company and IAC, as amended (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). IAC and the Company agree that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate and shall be of no further force and effect as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) After the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall consult
with IAC reasonably in advance of committing to any new marketing program as
described on Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter expected to
involve expenditures in excess of $250,000 and shall consider any reasonable
input provided by IAC.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall,
and the Company shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees to, and shall cause the agents,
financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives (collectively " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of
its Affiliates to: (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
persons conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct or otherwise request, each
person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within
the twelve (12)-month period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection
with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal to return or destroy
all such confidential information or documents previously furnished in
connection therewith or material incorporating any such information in the
possession of such person or its Representatives, (B) terminate access by all
persons (other than IAC and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic
data rooms relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal and (C) from and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the Termination Date, not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
confidential information) any inquiries regarding, or the making, submission
or

 



      
 

 



 

announcement by any person of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
person regarding a Company Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any other person
(other than IAC and its Representatives) any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any person (other than IAC and its Representatives), in each case in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a Company
Takeover Proposal (other than to refer the inquiring person to this _Section
5.3_), (3) approve, endorse or recommend and Company Takeover Proposal or

recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement,
commitment, or agreement in principle providing for a Company Takeover
Proposal or (4) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Except as specifically provided by this Agreement, the Company shall not
take any action to exempt any person from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in § 203 of the DGCL or the Company Organizational
Documents or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. Except if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that any such action or forbearance would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any third
party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under any (i) standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) confidentiality provision in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(excluding any waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not reasonably be likely
to, facilitate or encourage a Company Takeover Proposal).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval but not after, the Company receives
a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person
that did not result from, directly or indirectly, a breach of this _Section
5.3_ and the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the person that has made such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall substantially
concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to IAC any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided
or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided or made available to IAC and (B)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal (including making
counterproposals) and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover
Proposal. " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate to the Company than those applicable to IAC that are contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement
shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of
this _Section 5.3_ and _provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality
agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or
otherwise restrict the making of or amendment or modification to Company
Takeover Proposals.

 



 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, IAC of any Company
Takeover Proposal received by the Company or any of its Representatives, which
notice shall include the identity of the person making the Company Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, including unredacted
copies of any written proposal relating thereto provided to the Company or any
of its Representatives (including copies of any material amendments thereto)
and indicate whether the Company has furnished nonpublic information to, or
entered into discussions or negotiations with, such third party. The Company
shall keep IAC reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis as to the
status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after any determination) advise IAC in writing if the Company Board
of Directors determines to begin providing information or engaging in
discussions or negotiations concerning a Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to
_Section 5.3(c)_. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to IAC in
accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(e)_, the Company Board
of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to the Company stockholders
(and at all times thereafter prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval), (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to IAC, the Company Recommendation, (C) make, or publicly propose to
make, any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board of Directors of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (D) fail to recommend
against a Company Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation, in either case within five (5) Business Days after a request
by IAC to do so or (E) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such
actions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) such five (5) Business Day period
referred to in the foregoing clause (D) shall be extended for an additional
five (5) Business Days following any material modification to any Company
Takeover Proposal occurring after the receipt of IACs written request and (2)
IAC shall be entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation only
once for each Company Takeover Proposal and once for each material amendment
to such Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii)
authorize, approve or recommend or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or
agreement in principle providing for any Company Takeover Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder

 



      
 

 



 

Approval is obtained, the Company Board of Directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of
the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal, in either case if (x)
the Company is not in breach of this _Section 5.3_ and (y) after receiving a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result
from, directly or indirectly, a breach of _Section 5.3(a)_, the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, (i) after consultation with outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with
outside legal counsel, in light of such Company Takeover Proposal, that the
failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making any Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, (A) the Company has given IAC at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to IAC a copy of the
Superior Proposal and a copy of any written proposed transaction documents
relating to such Superior Proposal (including any financing commitments
related thereto), (B) the Company has negotiated in good faith with IAC during
such notice period, to the extent IAC wishes to negotiate in good faith, to
enable IAC to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it
would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of
Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by IAC, and shall have determined, after
consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by IAC were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of any
change to any material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to IAC an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the three (3) Business
Day period notice period referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall
instead be equal to two (2) Business Days) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso.

 



 

(f) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ and shall not be
subject to this _Section 5.3(f)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
or restrict the Company Board of Directors from making an Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than as described in clause (C) of the definition
thereof) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than pursuant to clause (C) of the definition
thereof) would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making
such Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given IAC at least
four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
(B) the Company has negotiated, and directed

 



      
 

 



 

its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with IAC during such notice
period after giving any such notice, to the extent IAC wishes to negotiate in
good faith, to enable IAC to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
such that it would not permit the Company Board of Directors to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_ and (C)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by IAC, and shall have determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
(other than pursuant to clause (C) of the definition thereof) in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board of
Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
determination in good faith of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or obligations under applicable federal securities Law of the
Company Board of Directors, _provided_ that any public disclosure (other than
any "stop, look and listen" statement made under Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) by the Company or the Company Board of Directors pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(g)_ shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly and publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, IAC and the Company shall prepare, and IAC shall cause NewCo to
file with the SEC, the Form S-4, which will include the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of IAC and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements. The Company
will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC under the Securities Act. IAC shall use its reasonable
best efforts, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with IAC, to keep the
Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to permit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Ancillary
Agreements, including the Merger. IAC shall also cause NewCo to take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of NewCo Class A Common
Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, or holders of a
beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested by IAC in
connection with any such action. No filing or mailing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by
IAC or the Company, as applicable, without the others prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without

 



      
 

 



 

providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon (which comments shall be considered by the other party in good faith);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company, in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change or if otherwise required by Law (on the advice of
outside counsel), may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment, and in such event, this right of approval
shall apply only with respect to information relating to IAC or its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, financial condition or results of
operations. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and, thereby, an amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4 (by way of incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains
(a) an Adverse Recommendation Change, (b) a statement of the reason of the
Board of Directors of the Company for making such Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (c) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and IAC shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and advise the other party or
any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4. Each of the Company and IAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and IAC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with
respect to the Form S-4. IAC or the Company, as applicable, will advise the
other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been
filed, the threat or issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide
the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to IAC or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by IAC or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, each of
IAC and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to make
and to cause NewCo to make all other filings required to be made with respect
to the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary
Agreements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable state
"blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws
and the Company Organizational Documents to establish a record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the clearance of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, the Company shall
take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company
Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may, and IAC may require the Company to, adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting to a date that is not more than twenty (20) days
after the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law) if sufficient votes to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have
not been obtained. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date
or establish a different record for the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of IAC, unless required to do so by applicable Law
or the Companys bylaws. The Company will, except in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change in compliance with _Section 5.3(e)_ or _Section
5.3(f)_ as applicable, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend that
its stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to
(i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and (ii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NASDAQ or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals. Prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall, upon the reasonable request of IAC,
direct the proxy solicitor or other agent of the Company to advise IAC, once a
day for each of the seven (7) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without limiting any other provision hereof, each of IAC and the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions
and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including: (i) making filings and responding to inquiries under the HSR Act;
(ii) defending any Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Ancillary Agreements; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional
instruments or documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out and document the intent of, this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) IAC and the Company will file, or cause to be filed, their respective
initial pre-merger notifications under the HSR Act no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and IAC shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation

 



       
 

 



 

of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. The Company
and IAC shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Entity regarding HSR Act matters, and shall comply as promptly as
practicable with any such inquiry or request. Each of the Company and IAC
shall direct its counsel (to the extent permitted by applicable Law and in
each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Ancillary Agreements and without waiving attorney-client, work product or any
other applicable privilege) to furnish to the others counsel such reasonably
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act. Unless required by applicable Law, none of the Company or
IAC or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
independently contact any Governmental Entity or participate in any meeting or
discussion (or any other substantive communication by any means) with any
Governmental Entity regarding HSR Act matters without giving, in the case of
IAC and its Affiliates, the Company, and in the case of the Company and its
Affiliates, IAC prior reasonable notice of the meeting or discussion, and, to
the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and participate at the meeting or discussion (which, at the request of
the Company or IAC, as applicable, shall be limited to outside antitrust
counsel only).

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.5(a)_, _Section 5.5(b)_
and _Section 5.5(c)_, but subject to _Section 5.5(e)_, IAC shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions, including taking all such further action as may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity may
assert under any antitrust or competition Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and by the Ancillary Agreements, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any such Law that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements so as to enable Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End
Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets or businesses of NewCo or any of its Subsidiaries
(including HomeAdvisor, Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) and (y) otherwise taking or committing
to take any actions that after the Closing would limit the freedom of NewCo or
its Subsidiaries (including HomeAdvisor, Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) with respect to, or
their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or
assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
become subject to, or be required to consent or agree to or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or order, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is binding only in the event that the Closing occurs and; _provided_ ,
_further_ that any proposed sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of NewCo or any of its Subsidiaries (including HomeAdvisor, Inc.
and its Subsidiaries and the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing) may only occur

 



      
 

 



 

following the Contribution with such proceeds of any such sale, divestiture or
disposition being paid to NewCo.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of IAC
nor any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall be required to offer or
commit to hold separate, sell, divest or dispose of any assets or businesses
of IAC or any of its Subsidiaries (including NewCo, HomeAdvisor, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries and the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing)
that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as
measured against the Company.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations becomes, or is deemed applicable to the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements,
the Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, each party
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, public
statement or other public communication with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements and, subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, the rules of any securities exchange or
regulatory body, court process or rule, shall not issue any such press
release, public statement or other public communication prior to such
consultation. IAC and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable initial
joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and other
initial communications regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 5.7_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made
with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with
_Section 5.3_.

 



 

(b) Unless an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, the Company shall
consult with IAC regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of
any material developments or matters involving the Company, including earnings
releases and regulatory matters, reasonably in advance of publication and
release.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) NewCo and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, NewCo and the Surviving
Company shall maintain in effect (to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law) any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate
of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses
provisions of the Surviving Companys organizational documents in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification and exculpation in respect of
any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Company shall, and NewCo shall cause the Surviving Company
to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current
and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking consistent with the Company Organizational
Documents and applicable Law to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether commenced before or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
including acts or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party serving
as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of
any such Action, the Surviving Company shall cooperate with the Indemnified
Party in the defense of any such Action.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, NewCo shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries or
provide substitute policies for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage in
effect as of the date of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less
than the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or
arising on or before the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo shall not be required
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverages
(the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in
such case shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
possible that does not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement. If (i) the Company elects, with
the prior written consent of IAC, or (ii) IAC elects, then the Company or IAC,
as applicable, may at NewCos cost, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
"tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the
Company, exceed the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased,
NewCo shall have no further obligations under this _Section 5.8(c)_.

 



 

(d) NewCo shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other applicable rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company,
any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

 



 

(f) The obligations of NewCo and the Surviving Company under this _Section
5.8_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and
legal representatives) to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies without the consent
of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_, and (ii) this _Section 5.8_ shall
survive consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such
Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal
representatives against NewCo and the Surviving Company and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

(g) In the event NewCo or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then and in each such case, NewCo shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of NewCo assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.8_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, IAC shall cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to provide each employee of Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by NewCo or its Subsidiaries (including Company and
its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time for so long as such
employee is employed following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other compensation
and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than either
(A) those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time or
(B) those provided by IAC to similarly situated employees of IAC.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by NewCo or any of
its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, such
Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for service with Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, to
the same extent such service was recognized as of the Effective Time under a
comparable plan of Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employee participated (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plans, special or early retirement programs, window
separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect from time to
time); _provided_ that in no event shall such service recognition result in
any duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of any insurance policy, IAC shall waive, or cause to be waived, any
preexisting condition limitations, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by IAC or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such preexisting condition
limitations, exclusions and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable plan of Company and its Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employee participated.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan, (ii) prohibit IAC or any of
its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or
(iii) confer any rights or benefits on any person other than the parties to
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit IAC from terminating
or causing Company to terminate (A) any employee benefit plan following the
Effective Time, or (B) the employment (for any reason or for no reason) of any
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time without the provision of
further salary, bonus or benefits following such termination, except to the
extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give IAC or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and IAC shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries operations.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, NewCo and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to NewCo Class A Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to NewCo, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise IAC
of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Ancillary Agreements, including the Merger, and shall keep IAC reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall provide IAC with the
opportunity to participate in the Companys defense or settlement of any
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive officers
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Ancillary Agreements, including the Merger. The Company agrees that it shall
not settle, or offer to settle, any such litigation relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Ancillary Agreements,
including the Merger, without the prior written consent of IAC, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 



 

(b) None of the Company, IAC, NewCo, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, shall take, or omit to take, any action that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, prevent or impede (i) the Merger (or, the Merger
and a subsequent forward merger described in _Section 5.13(d)_, taken
together) from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, the Merger, when combined with the
Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, from qualifying as an exchange
described in Section 351(a) of the Code, or (ii) the Contribution and IAC
Share Issuance, taken together, from qualifying as an exchange described in
Section 351(a) of the Code.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the assets of AL BV
Investment, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to be owned (or treated for federal
income tax purposes as being owned) directly by the Company pursuant to one or
more transactions that are collectively treated as a "complete liquidation" of
AL BV Investment, Inc. within the meaning of Sections 332(a) and 337(a) of the
Code or a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
evaluate additional steps (including a forward merger of the Company
subsequent to the Merger) that could be taken to preserve the intended
treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code in the event that the Merger otherwise would not so
qualify.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.14 _NASDAQ Listing_. Each of IAC and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause NewCo Class A Common Stock issuable in the
Merger and such other NewCo Class A Common Stock to be reserved for issuance

approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. IAC shall provide the Company with the opportunity

with any action contemplated by this _Section 5.14_.

reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Company Common Stock to be de-

reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. The Company shall
reasonably cooperate with IAC in connection with the actions contemplated by
this _Section 5.15_.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Company Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall deliver to IAC, at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, a payoff letter with respect to the Financing Agreement,
dated as of September 26, 2014, by and among the Company, the Subsidiaries of
the Company party thereto, the lenders party thereto and TCW Asset Management

satisfied, and all obligations of the lenders terminated, and (b) all Liens
relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Company Credit

to the Effective Time, IAC or one of its Subsidiaries shall provide, pursuant
to the Intercompany Note, all funds to the Company required to pay off all
amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement (including accrued and
unpaid interest, related fees and expenses); _provided_ that the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall use such funds to effect such repayment.

shall promptly notify the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) has had or is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, in the case of the Company, or HomeAdvisor Material
Adverse Effect, in the case of IAC or (b) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein; _provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance
with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this _Section 5.17_ or the failure of any condition
set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying change or event would independently
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section
6.3_ to be satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.18 _Ancillary Agreements_.

 



 

(a) IAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Contribution
and the IAC Share Issuance in accordance with _Section 1.1_ and the Ancillary
Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, IAC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each condition set forth in Section 2.04(c) of the
Contribution Agreement (other than Section 2.04(c)(1)) to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement. IAC shall enter
into, and shall cause NewCo to enter into, the Ancillary Agreements (in the
forms attached to this Agreement, or as amended pursuant to _Section 5.18(b)_
below) to which IAC and/or NewCo is a party at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Any changes proposed by IAC prior to the Effective Time to any of the
Ancillary Agreements from the forms attached to this Agreement as Exhibits EJ
(or if the Ancillary Agreements are executed prior to the Effective Time, to
such executed documents) shall be subject to the prior approval of the Company
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ it shall be deemed reasonable for the Company to withhold its
consent to any such proposed changes which would be adverse in any material
respect to the Company or the Companys stockholders).

 



 

Section 5.19 _Obligations of NewCo and Merger Sub_. IAC shall take all action
necessary to cause each of NewCo and Merger Sub to perform their respective
obligations to be performed under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time
and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Ancillary Agreements, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
respectively.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Financial Statements_. As promptly as reasonably practicable and
in no event later than August 1, 2017, IAC shall provide the Company with (i)
the audited combined and consolidated financial statements of the HomeAdvisor
Business, including the combined statements of income, equity and cash flows
of the HomeAdvisor Business, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016,
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (collectively, the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited combined and consolidated
financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business for applicable interim
periods required to be included in the Form S-4 on August 1, 2017 pursuant to
for SEC rules (the " _Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_ "), prepared in
all material respects from the books and records of IAC and its Subsidiaries
and in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements
of Regulation S-X. IAC will use reasonable best efforts to procure, at its
expense, the delivery of the consents of its independent accountants required
to be filed with the Form S-4 Registration Statement or any future
registration statement until such independent accountant consents are no
longer required.

_Section 5.13(d)_, taken together) will qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (B) the Merger, when combined
with the Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, will qualify as an exchange
described in Section 351(a) of the Code. Such counsel shall be entitled to
rely upon representation letters from each of NewCo, Merger Sub and the
Company (and, in the case of the opinion described in clause (B), IAC) in form
and substance satisfactory to such counsel;

 



 

(g) IAC shall deliver each duly executed Ancillary Agreement to the Company
and each Ancillary Agreement shall be, or will automatically be at the
Effective Time, in full force and effect; and

Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except
with respect to this clause (iii) where the failure of such representations
and warranties to be so true and correct (without regard to any qualifications
or exceptions contained as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
contained in such representations and warranties) has not had or would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

and complied with all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Effective Time;

(e) IAC shall have received a written opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to IAC, dated as of the
Closing Date, and based on the facts, representations, assumptions and
exclusions set forth or referred to in such opinion, to the effect that the
Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, taken together, will qualify as an
exchange as described in Section 351(a) of the Code. Such counsel shall be
entitled to rely upon representation letters from each of IAC, NewCo and the
Company in form and substance satisfactory to such counsel.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company nor IAC

this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_, as the case may be,
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys Willful and
Material Breach of any material provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained (except as otherwise provided below):

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and IAC;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or IAC, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to February 1, 2018 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_
that the right to

 



      
 

 



 

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall
be due to the material breach by such party of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or IAC, if an Order shall have been entered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, including
the Contribution or the IAC Share Issuance, and such Order shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a party
if such injunction was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by either the Company or IAC, if the Company Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and
the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if IAC, NewCo or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed
to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
if it occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in
a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_
and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such
breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, IAC has not cured
such breach or failure within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving
written notice from the Company describing such breach or failure in
reasonable detail ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_
or _Section 6.3(b)_);

 



 

(f) by IAC, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ and (ii) by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure is
capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company has not cured such breach
or failure within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving written notice
from IAC describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail ( _provided_
that IAC is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein that would result in a failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_);

 



 

(g) by IAC, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in the event
of an Adverse Recommendation Change; or

 



 

(h) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation
of the transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal (it being understood
that the Company shall enter into such definitive agreement concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement), but only if the Company is in compliance
with _Section 5.3_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall prior to or concurrently with such termination pay the Company
Termination Fee to an account designated by IAC pursuant to _Section 7.3_.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, notice thereof shall be given to the
other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made and the basis therefor described in reasonable
detail, and this Agreement shall terminate (except for _Section 5.2(b)_, this
_Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_), and there shall be no
other liability on the part of the Company (including its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees or Representatives), on the one hand, or IAC, NewCo or
Merger Sub (including, in each case, its respective directors, officers,
employees or Representatives), on the other hand, to the other except as
provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 7.2_, _Section
7.3_, and liability arising out of or the result of, fraud or any Willful and
Material Breach of any covenant or agreement or Willful and Material Breach of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement occurring prior to
termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall not be limited to expense
reimbursement or any fee payable pursuant to _Section 7.3_, and shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by the Company, pursuant to _Section 7.1(h);_

 



 

(ii) by IAC pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ in the event of an Adverse
Recommendation Change; or

 



 

(iii) (x) by the Company or IAC pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section
7.1(d)_ of this Agreement, or by IAC pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ based on
the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ of this Agreement, (y) a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have been made or communicated to the Company Board of
Directors or shall have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly
known and (1) in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d) _shall
not have been publicly withdrawn by a date that is at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (2) in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_, shall not have
been withdrawn prior to such termination, and (z) within nine (9) months of
the termination of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to or
consummates a transaction that is a Company Takeover Proposal with a third
party (or a third party otherwise consummates a transaction that is a Company
Takeover Proposal);

 



 

(iv) then the Company shall pay to IAC $20,000,000 (the " _Company Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer (to an account designated by IAC) in immediately
available funds (A) in the case of clause (i), prior to or concurrently with
such termination, (B) in the case of clause (ii), within two (2) Business Days
of such termination, or (C) in the case of clause (iii), upon the earlier of
the entry into a definitive

 



      
 

 



 

agreement with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal and the consummation
of such transaction.

 



 

(b) The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be compensation and
liquidated damages for the loss suffered by IAC as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the
circumstances and the Company shall not have any other liability to IAC after
the payment of the Company Termination Fee, except in the case of fraud or a
Willful and Material Breach. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate IAC in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and
which do not involve fraud or Willful and Material Breach, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall IAC be entitled to more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee
in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the
Company Termination Fee is payable. Solely for purposes of this _Section
7.3_, "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in
_Section 8.15(b)(xiii)_, except that all references to 15% shall be changed
to 50%.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, IAC, NewCo and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, and that,
without these agreements, the Company, IAC, NewCo and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, IAC commences a suit that results in an award against the
Company for such amount, then the Company shall reimburse IAC for all costs
and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in such suit and
pay interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount
was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set
forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _No Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any schedule, instrument or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time, except for covenants and agreements which by their terms contemplate
performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly by their terms
survive termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.3_, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring or
required to incur such expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, but shall not
become effective unless and until one or more counterparts hereof have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered (by telecopy, electronic
delivery or otherwise) to all the other parties hereto. Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims, disputes or
causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy) in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not
performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it, including monetary damages, each of the parties hereto shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction, over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and all such rights
and remedies at law or in equity shall be cumulative, except as may be limited
by _Section 7.3_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. The parties further agree that no party to this Agreement
shall be required to obtain, secure, furnish or post any bond, security or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_ and each party waives any objection
to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the
obtaining, securing, furnishing or posting of any such bond, security or
similar instrument. In addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or
assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that

 



      
 

 



 

it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Ancillary Agreements in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of IAC, NewCo, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in
accordance with _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
(WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR BY THE ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) upon personal delivery to the
party to be notified; (b) when received when sent by email or facsimile by the
party to be notified, _provided_ , _however_ , that notice given by email or
facsimile shall not be effective unless and until the receiving party delivers
a written confirmation of receipt for such notice either by email or fax or
any other method described in this _Section 8.7_ or (c) when delivered by a
courier (with confirmation of delivery); in each case to the party to be

Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time

or persons to act for the stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be
voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that
it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest

person, by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering
a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the
Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be
by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted
by inspectors of

majority of the votes that could be cast by the holders of all outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote thereon that are present in person or by
proxy at such meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of
directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All

within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be
specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place
where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced, and kept at

 **6.4** **Claims**

 



 

If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this _Article 6_

director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity,
or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this _Article 6_.

 



 

 **6.8** **Amendments**

 



 

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this _Article 6_

Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any
director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice,
but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director

of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 



 

Any written waiver of notice signed by the person entitled to notice or a
waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, in each
case whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

 



 

 **7.4** **Interested Directors; Quorum**

 



 

No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one (1) or more of its
directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association or other organization in which one (1) or more of its
directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest,
shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the
director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board
of Directors or committee thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction,
or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if (1) the
material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes

class of the Corporations common stock, such Share Distribution may be
declared and paid only as follows:

 



 

(a) a Share Distribution

 



 

(i) consisting of shares of Class C common stock (or securities convertible

declared and paid to holders of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common
stock and Class C common stock, on an equal per share basis, or

 



 

(ii) consisting of (x) shares of Class A common stock (or securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common
stock) may be declared and paid to holders of shares of Class A common stock
on an equal per share basis, (y) shares of Class B common stock (or securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class B common
stock) may be declared and paid to holders of shares of Class B common stock,

(b) a Share Distribution consisting of any class or series of securities of
the Corporation or any other Person, other than shares of Class A common
stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock (or securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock, Class
B common stock or Class C common stock), may be declared and paid on the basis
of a dividend of

 



 

(i) identical securities, on an equal per share basis, to holders of shares of
Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock,

 



 

(ii) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class A
common stock, a separate class of securities to holders of shares of Class B
common stock and a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares
of Class C common stock, on an equal per share basis,

 



 

(iii) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class B
common stock and a different class or series of securities to holders of
shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock, on an equal per share
basis; or

 



 

(iv) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class C
common stock and a different class or series of securities to holders of
shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, on an equal per share
basis;

 



 

provided, that,

 



 

(A) in connection with a Share Distribution pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) or
(iv),

 



 

(1) such separate classes or series of securities (and, if the dividend
consists of Convertible Securities, the Underlying Securities) do not differ
in any respect other than their relative voting rights (and any related
differences in designation, conversion, redemption and share distribution
provisions, as applicable), with either

 



 

(X) holders of shares of Class B common stock receiving the class or series of
securities having (or convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
securities having) the highest relative voting rights and the holders of
shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock receiving securities
of a class or series of securities having (or convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for securities having) lesser relative voting rights, or

 



      
 

 



 

(Y) holders of Class B common stock and Class A common stock receiving a class
or series of securities having (or convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for securities having) the highest relative voting rights and the
holders of shares of the Class C common stock receiving securities of a class
or series of securities having (or convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for securities having) lesser relative voting rights,

 



 

in each case, without regard to whether such rights differ to a greater or
lesser extent than the corresponding differences in voting rights (and any
related differences in designation, conversion, redemption and share
distribution, as applicable) among the shares of Class A common stock, the
Class B common stock and the Class C common stock, and

 



 

(2) in the event the securities to be received by the holders of shares of
Class A common stock and Class C common stock consist of different classes or
series of securities, with each such class or series of securities (or the
Underlying Securities into which such class is convertible or for which such
class or series is exercisable or exchangeable) differing only with respect to
the relative voting rights of such class or series (and any related
differences in designation, conversion, redemption and share distribution
provisions, as applicable), then such classes or series of securities will be
distributed to the holders of shares of each class of common stock (other than
the Class B common stock) (A) as the Board of Directors determines or (B) such
that the relative voting rights (and any related differences in designation,
conversion, redemption and share distribution provisions, as applicable) of
the class or series of securities (or the Underlying Securities) to be
received by the holders of shares of each class of common stock (other than
the Class B common stock) corresponds to the extent practicable to the
relative voting rights (and any related differences in designation,
conversion, redemption and share distribution provisions, as applicable) of
such class of common stock, as compared to the other class of common stock
(other than the Class B common stock), and

 



 

(B) a dividend involving a class or series of securities of a Person other
than the Corporation may be treated as an Asset Distribution or as a Share
Distribution as determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

(3) Whenever a dividend in the form of an Asset Distribution is paid to the
holders of any class or classes of common stock of the Corporation then
outstanding, the Corporation shall also pay a dividend, in cash and/or other
property, to the holders of each other class of common stock then outstanding,
on an equal per share basis (but, for the avoidance of doubt, without
requiring that such dividend be identical in form), in an amount, in the case
of a dividend consisting solely of cash, equal to the fair market value of
such holders ownership interest (immediately prior to such Asset
Distribution) in the assets paid as a dividend pursuant to the Asset
Distribution, or having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of
Directors

 



      
 

 



 

in good faith), in the case of any other dividend, equal to the fair market
value (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith) of such holders
ownership interest (immediately prior to such Asset Distribution) in the
assets paid as a dividend pursuant to the Asset Distribution.

 



 

(4) For the purposes of this Article IV Section D and Article IV Section G:

 



 

" _Asset Distribution_ " means a dividend payable by delivery of an asset
owned by the Corporation including shares of any class or series of capital
stock of any Person owned by the Corporation.

in connection with any stock split, reclassification or recapitalization) in
shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation or any other Person,
other securities of the Corporation or any other Person (including Convertible
Securities).

 



 

" _Underlying Securities_ " means with respect to any class or series of
Convertible Securities, the class or series of securities into which such
class or series of Convertible Securities is directly or indirectly
convertible, or for which such Convertible Securities are directly or
indirectly exchangeable, or that such Convertible Securities evidence the
right to purchase or otherwise receive, directly or indirectly.

 



 

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the dividend or
other issuance by the Corporation of rights to purchase capital stock, other
securities or property pursuant to a "poison pill" stockholder rights plan
shall not be subject to this Section D of this Article IV.

 



 

E. _Other Matters Affecting Holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common
Stock and Class C Common Stock_.

 



 

(1) Shares of Class B common stock shall be convertible into shares of Class A
common stock of the Corporation at the option of the holder thereof at any
time on a share for share basis. Such conversion ratio shall in all events be
equitably preserved in the event of any recapitalization of the Corporation by
means of a stock dividend on, or a stock split or combination of, outstanding
shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, or in the event of any
merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Corporation with another
corporation. Shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class C common stock
will not be convertible into shares of any other class of capital stock of the
Corporation.

series of Preferred Stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as one
class.

preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
shares of Preferred Stock.

and authority to, in good faith (a) make all determinations regarding (1)
whether or not a dividend is an equal dividend per share or is declared and
paid on an equal per share basis and (ii) whether or not one or more classes
or series of securities, Convertible Securities or Underlying Securities
differ in any respect other than their relative voting rights (and any related
differences in designation, conversion, redemption and share distribution
provisions) and (b) interpret this Article IV and make any other determination
required herein. All such interpretations and determinations made by the Board
of Directors shall be final, conclusive and binding. The Secretary of the

the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in
his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, the
" _undertaking_ ") by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by

 



      
 

 



 

final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal (a "
_final disposition_ ") that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Bylaw or otherwise. The rights
conferred upon indemnitees in this Bylaw shall be contract rights that vest at
the time of such persons service to or at the request of the Corporation and
such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a
director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.

 



 

(B) To obtain indemnification under this Bylaw, a claimant shall submit to the
Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and
is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant
is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for
indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (B), a
determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants
entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (i) if requested by the
claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if no
request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel,
(a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, or (b) by
a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of the
Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are
no Disinterested Directors or the Disinterested Directors so direct, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of
which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (d) if a quorum of Disinterested
Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation. If it is so
determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the
claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.

 



 

(C) If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Bylaw is not paid in full by the
Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim pursuant to
paragraph (B) of this Bylaw has been received by the Corporation (except in
the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, for which the applicable
period is twenty (20) days), the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes
it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including the Disinterested Directors, Independent
Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including the Disinterested Directors,
Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

 



      
 

 



 

(D) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to paragraph (B) of this
Bylaw that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall
be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant
to paragraph (C) of this Bylaw.

 



 

(E) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding commenced pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Bylaw that the
procedures and presumptions of this Bylaw are not valid, binding and
enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is
bound by all the provisions of this Bylaw.

 



 

(F) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Bylaw (i) shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise and (ii) cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the
Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a
persons service prior to the date of such termination. Any amendment,
modification, alteration or repeal of this Bylaw that in any way diminishes,
limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee
or his successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise
shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict,
adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or
alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously
existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought
or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state
of facts, occurrence, action or omission.

 



 

(G) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board of Directors or by the Chairman, grant rights to indemnification, and
rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any current or former
employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions
of this Bylaw with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses
of current or former directors and officers of the Corporation.

 



 

(H) If any provision or provisions of this Bylaw shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Bylaw (including,
without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Bylaw containing any
such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not
itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the
provisions of this Bylaw (including, without limitation, each such portion of
any paragraph of this Bylaw containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the
intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

 



      
 

 



 

(I) For purposes of this Bylaw:

 



 

(i) " _Disinterested Director_ " means a director of the Corporation who is
not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is
sought by the claimant.

 



 

(ii) " _Independent Counsel_ " means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an
independent practitioner, selected by the Disinterested Directors, that is
experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who,
under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would
not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the
claimant in an action to determine the claimants rights under this Bylaw.

 



 

(J) Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be
given to the Corporation under this Bylaw shall be in writing and either
delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram, overnight mail or
courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Corporation and shall be effective
only upon receipt by the Secretary.

 



 

Section 2. **_Insurance_.** The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any current or former director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation and any current or former director,
officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including any person
who serves or served in any such capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against any expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

ARTICLE II

 



 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 



 

Section 2.1 _Requested Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Request for Registration_. Subject to the conditions set forth in this
_Section 2.1_, if NewCo shall receive from IAC a written demand (a " _Demand
Notice_ ") signed by an authorized officer of IAC requesting that NewCo effect
the registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities, NewCo
shall, as soon as practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to effect such
registration under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act
and to permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion
of such Registrable Securities as is specified in such Demand Notice (such
registration, an " _IAC Registration_ "). The Demand Notice shall state the
aggregate number of shares of Registrable Securities intended to be registered
and the intended methods of disposition thereof (including whether the
offering is to be an Underwritten Offering) and the registration procedures to
be undertaken by NewCo in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) _Filing of Registration Statement_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section 2.1_, promptly upon receipt of a Demand Notice, NewCo will file the
applicable Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable and will
use its best efforts to, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Demand
Notice, effect within one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing of such
Registration Statement the registration under the Securities Act (including,
without limitation, appropriate qualification under applicable "blue sky" or
other securities laws) of the Registrable Securities that NewCo has been
required to register pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 



 

(c) _Limitations on Requested Registration_. NewCo shall not be obligated to
effect, or to take any action to effect, any IAC Registration pursuant to this
_Section 2.1_:

 



 

(i) in any twelve (12)-month period, after NewCo has initiated two (2) IAC
Registrations (counting for these purposes only Registration Statements that
have been publicly filed with the SEC (with the initially filed Registration
Statement and any subsequent amendments thereto counting as a single
Registration Statement)); or

 



 

(ii) if IAC proposes to dispose of Registrable Securities that may be
immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made under _Section
2.3_.

 



 

(d) _Deferral_. If (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors, the filing or the effectiveness or availability of a Registration
Statement covering the Registrable Securities (A) would be materially
detrimental to NewCo due to the early disclosure of information relating to
the business, financial condition or results of operation of NewCo that NewCo
is not otherwise then obligated to disclose or (B) would put at material risk
a then-contemplated primary offering by NewCo of NewCo Common Stock pursuant
to a NewCo initiated registration statement (whether previously filed or
proposed to be filed), (ii) the Board of Directors concludes, as a result,
that it is in the best interests of NewCo to defer the filing or suspend the
effectiveness or availability of such Registration Statement at such time, and
(iii) NewCo furnishes to IAC a certificate signed by the Chairperson of the
Audit Committee of

 



      
 

 



 

NewCo stating that, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors, it would be materially detrimental to NewCo for such Registration
Statement to be filed or to be declared effective or available in the near
future and that it is, therefore, in the best interests of NewCo to defer the
filing or suspend the effectiveness or availability of such Registration
Statement, then NewCo shall have the right, by written notice to IAC, to defer
such filing or suspend the effectiveness or availability of such Registration
Statement for a period of not more than seventy-five (75) days after receipt
of the Demand Notice (or such shorter period that the Board of Directors
concludes in good faith is necessary); _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo
shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than twice in any twelve
(12)-month period.

 



 

(e) _Withdrawal of Request_. IAC may withdraw its request for registration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ at any time. If IAC does withdraw its request
for registration, NewCo shall cease all efforts to secure registration and
such registration nonetheless shall be deemed an IAC Registration for purposes
of _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ unless (i) the withdrawal is made following deferral
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, (ii) IAC shall have learned that there has
been a material adverse change in the business or prospects of NewCo since the
date of the applicable Demand Notice and IAC has withdrawn its request for
registration with reasonable promptness after learning of such material
adverse change, or (iii) IAC shall have paid or reimbursed NewCo for all of
the Registration Expenses incurred by NewCo in connection with the withdrawn
registration.

 



 

(f) _Underwriting_. If IAC intends to distribute any Registrable Securities
covered by its request by means of an underwriting (an " _Underwritten
Offering_ "), it shall so advise NewCo as a part of its request made pursuant
to this _Section 2.1_. In such event, the right of IAC to include all or any
portion of its Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering shall be
conditioned upon IACs participation in such underwriting on the terms and
subject to the applicable provisions herein. In the case of an IAC
Registration involving an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, IAC
shall select the underwriters, _provided_ that the managing underwriter shall
be a nationally recognized investment banking firm. IAC shall determine the
pricing of the Registrable Securities offered pursuant to any such
Registration Statement in connection with an IAC Registration, the applicable
underwriting discount and other financial terms (including the material terms
of the applicable underwriting agreement, such agreement to be reasonably
satisfactory to NewCo and to contain such representations and warranties by
NewCo, indemnification/contribution provisions and such other terms as are
generally prevailing in agreements of that type) and determine the timing of
any such registration and sale, subject to this _Section 2.1_, and IAC shall
be solely responsible for all such discounts and fees payable to such
underwriters in such Underwritten Offering (except with respect to any
securities sold by NewCo or another security holder of NewCo in such IAC
Registration). If NewCo shall request inclusion in any IAC Registration of
securities being sold for its own account, or if any other security holder of
NewCo shall request inclusion in any IAC Registration pursuant to this
_Section 2.1_ and the distribution is to be made by means of an Underwritten
Offering, IAC may, in its sole discretion, offer to include such securities in
the Underwritten Offering and such offer shall be conditioned upon the
participation of NewCo or such other Person in such underwriting and the
inclusion of NewCos and/or such other Persons securities of NewCo on the
terms and subject to the applicable provisions of this _Article II_.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Underwriter Cutback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 2.1_, if the managing underwriter of any IAC Registration involving
an Underwritten Offering advises IAC in writing that the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering, when added
to the number of other securities to be offered in the Underwritten Offering
as permitted by IAC pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_, would materially adversely
impact the purchase price obtained for the securities to be included or the
total proceeds contemplated in such Underwritten Offering, then the following
securities shall be included in such IAC Registration, to the extent of the
total number of securities that IAC is so advised can be sold in (or during
the time of) such offering without so materially adversely affecting such
offering (the " _Section 2.1(g) Sale Number_"): (i) first, all Registrable
Securities IAC proposed to register in the applicable Demand Notice; (ii)
second, to the extent the number of securities to be registered pursuant to
the foregoing clause (i) is less than the Section 2.1(g) Sale Number, the
number of securities proposed to be registered by NewCo; and (iii) third, to
the extent the number of securities to be registered pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i), when added to the securities to be registered pursuant to the
foregoing clause (ii), is less than the Section 2.1(g) Sale Number, the number
of securities proposed to be registered by any other security holder of NewCo.

 



 

(h) _Exclusion from Underwriting_. If a security holder of NewCo who has
requested inclusion in an IAC Registration involving an Underwritten Offering
as provided in _Section 2.1(f)_ does not agree to the terms of any such
Underwritten Offering, such Person shall be excluded therefrom by written
notice from NewCo, the managing underwriter or IAC. The securities so excluded
shall also be withdrawn from such registration (to the extent previously
included).

 



 

Section 2.2 _NewCo Registration_.

 



 

(a) _NewCo Registration_. If NewCo shall determine to register the disposition
of any securities issued or to be issued by it, either for its own account or
the account of a security holder or holders (a " _NewCo Registration_ "),
other than (i) a registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.3_ or
_Section 2.4_, (ii) a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans,
(iii) a registration relating solely to the offer and sale of debt securities
(including debt securities convertible into equity securities), or (iv) a
registration relating solely to a corporate reorganization or other Rule 145
transaction, NewCo shall:

 



 

(A) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration to IAC; and

 



 

(B) use its reasonable best efforts to include in such NewCo Registration,
except as set forth in _Section 2.2(c)_ and _Section 2.2(d)_, and in any
Underwritten Offering involved therein, all such Registrable Securities
specified in any written request or requests made by IAC (each, a " _Piggyback
Demand_ ") and received by NewCo within twenty (20) days after such written
notice from NewCo is delivered to IAC. Such Piggyback Demand may specify that
IAC desires to include in such registration all or any portion of the
Registrable Securities.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Underwriting_. If the NewCo Registration is intended to be made by means
of an Underwritten Offering, NewCo shall so advise IAC as a part of the
written notice given pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(A)_. In such event, the
right of IAC to participate in such Underwritten Offering shall be conditioned
upon IACs participation in such underwriting on the terms and subject to the
applicable provisions herein. If IAC proposes to distribute its Registrable
Securities through such Underwritten Offering it shall (together with NewCo
and any other security holders of NewCo permitted to participate in such
Underwritten Offering) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
(including any customary "lock-up" arrangements) with the representative of
the underwriter or underwriters selected by NewCo, _provided_ that the terms
and conditions of the underwriting agreement shall be subject to IACs written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(c) _Underwriter Cutback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 2.2_, if the managing underwriter of any NewCo Registration
involving an Underwritten Offering advises NewCo in writing that the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering,
when added to the number of other securities to be offered in the Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(B)_ (and any securities held by any
other security holder of NewCo as permitted by NewCo), would materially
adversely impact the purchase price obtained for the securities to be included
or the total proceeds contemplated in such Underwritten Offering, then the
following securities shall be included in such NewCo Registration, to the
extent of the total number of securities that NewCo is so advised can be sold
in (or during the time of) such offering without so materially adversely
affecting such offering (the " _Section 2.2(c) Sale Number_"): (i) first, all
securities proposed to be registered by NewCo; (ii) second, to the extent the
number of securities proposed to be registered pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i) is less than the Section 2.2(c) Sale Number, the number of
Registrable Securities proposed to be registered by IAC; and (iii) third, to
the extent the number of securities to be registered pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i), when added to the securities to be registered pursuant to the
foregoing clause (ii), is less than the Section 2.2(c) Sale Number, the number
of securities proposed to be registered by any other security holder of NewCo.

 



 

(d) _Exclusion from Underwriting_. If a security holder of NewCo who has
requested inclusion in such NewCo Registration involving an Underwritten
Offering does not agree to the terms of any such Underwritten Offering, such
Person shall be excluded therefrom by written notice from NewCo, the managing
underwriter or IAC. The securities so excluded shall also be withdrawn from
such registration (to the extent previously included).

 



 

(e) _Right to Terminate Registration_. NewCo shall have the right to terminate
or withdraw any NewCo Registration prior to the applicable Registration
Statement having been declared or ordered effective by the SEC whether or not
IAC has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. IAC
shall also have the right to withdraw its request for inclusion of its
Registrable Securities in a NewCo Registration at any time.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Registration on Form S-3_.

 



 

(a) _Request for Form S-3 Registration_. After the Merger Effective Time,
NewCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to qualify for the use of Form S-3
pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor
form under a successor rule, as

 



      
 

 



 

applicable. After NewCo has qualified for the use of Form S-3, in addition to
the rights contained in the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.3_ and
subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 2.3_, if NewCo shall
receive from IAC a written request that NewCo effect any registration on Form
S-3 or any similar short form Registration Statement with respect to all or
any portion of the Registrable Securities (which request shall state the
number of shares of Registrable Securities to be disposed of and the intended
methods of disposition of such shares by IAC), NewCo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to effect such registration under and in accordance with the
provisions of the Securities Act and to permit or facilitate the sale and
distribution of all or such portion of such Registrable Securities as shall be
specified in such request. At any time a Form S-3 shall be effective and
remain effective, IAC shall be permitted to effect an unlimited number of (i)
non-Underwritten Offerings or (ii) shelf take-downs off the Form S-3 (which
may be Underwritten Offerings), including any underwritten "block trades," in
each case, without notice to, or inclusion of, any other securities held by
NewCo or any other Person, and in each case, limited to the Registrable
Securities.

 



 

(b) _Deferral_. The provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_ shall apply to any
registration pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(c) _Underwriting_. If IAC requests registration under this _Section 2.3_
intending to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by its request by
means of an Underwritten Offering, the provisions of _Section 2.1(f)_,
_Section 2.1(g)_ and _Section 2.1(h)_ shall apply to such registration.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, registrations
effected pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall not be counted as requested for
registration or registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Registration in Connection with Spin-Off_. In addition to the
other rights provided for herein, NewCo agrees that if any Registrable
Securities require registration with or approval of any Governmental Authority
before such Registrable Securities may be distributed to IAC stockholders,
whether by dividend, recapitalization, exchange, redemption or other
extraordinary transaction, or sold by such IAC stockholders thereafter without
restriction under applicable law, NewCo shall cause such Registrable
Securities to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. In addition,
NewCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to list any shares of NewCo Class
A Common Stock required to be delivered upon any conversion, exchange or
transfer of shares of the NewCo Class B Common Stock prior to such delivery,
on each national securities exchange or interdealer quotation system on which
the outstanding NewCo Class A Common Stock is listed at the time of such
delivery.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Expenses of Registration_. Except as contemplated by _Section
2.1(f)_, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with registrations
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_, _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_
hereof shall be borne by NewCo; _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo shall not
be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_ if the
registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of IAC (unless
(i) the withdrawal is made following deferral pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_,
or (ii) the withdrawal is based on the reasonable determination of IAC that
there has been, since the date of the applicable Demand Notice, a material
adverse change in the business or prospects of NewCo). All Selling Expenses
relating to securities registered on behalf of IAC and any other holders of
securities shall be borne by IAC and such other holders of

 



      
 

 



 

securities included in such registration _pro rata_ in proportion to the
number of securities to be registered by a holder versus the total number of
securities to be included in such registration by the Company and all
participating holders.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Registration Procedures_. IAC agrees to furnish to NewCo such
information regarding IAC and the distribution proposed by IAC as NewCo may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in
this _Article II_. In the case of each registration effected by NewCo
pursuant to this _Article II_, NewCo shall keep IAC promptly informed in
writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the completion
thereof. At its expense, NewCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(a) keep the relevant registration effective for a period ending on the
earlier of the date that is one-hundred and twenty (120) days from the
effective date of the applicable Registration Statement or such time as IAC
has completed the distribution described in such Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
Registration Statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by such Registration Statement for the period set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_;

 



 

(c) furnish such number of prospectuses, including any preliminary
prospectuses, and other documents incident thereto, including any amendment of
or supplement to the prospectus, as IAC may from time to time reasonably
request;

 



 

(d) register and qualify the securities covered by such Registration Statement
under such other securities laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably
requested by IAC;

 



 

(e) notify IAC at any time when a prospectus relating to a Registration
Statement registering the offering of Registrable Securities is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result
of which the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or incomplete in light of the circumstances
then existing, and following such notification promptly (and in any event
within five (5) days thereafter) prepare and furnish to IAC a reasonable
number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may
be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Registrable
Securities covered by such prospectus, such prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or incomplete in light of the circumstances then existing;

 



 

(f) furnish, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the
underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through an
Underwritten Offering, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel
representing NewCo for the purposes of such registration, in form and
substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an Underwritten

 



      
 

 



 

Offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any and (ii) a "comfort" letter
dated as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of
NewCo, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified
public accountants to underwriters in an Underwritten Offering, addressed to
the underwriters;

 



 

(g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
registered pursuant to such Registration Statement and a CUSIP number for all
such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of
such registration;

 



 

(h) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12) months, but not
more than eighteen (18) months, beginning with the first (1st) month after the
effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act;

 



 

(i) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of NewCo Class B
Common Stock) to be listed on each over-the-counter market, interdealer
quotation system or securities exchange on which securities issued by NewCo
are then listed; and

 



 

(j) in connection with any Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Registration
Statement filed pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.3_ hereof, enter
into an underwriting agreement in form reasonably necessary to effect the
offer and sale of securities issued by NewCo; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such underwriting agreement contains reasonable and customary provisions, and
_provided further_ , _however_ , that IAC shall also enter into and perform
its obligations under such an agreement.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) NewCo shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
harmless IAC and each of its Affiliates (other than NewCo and its
Subsidiaries), officers, directors, employees and partners, legal counsel, and
accountants (each, an " _IAC Covered Person_ ") against any losses, claims,
actions, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel and other professional advisors), joint or several, to
which such IAC Covered Person may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state "blue sky" securities law, any equivalent non-U.S.
securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, actions,
damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained or
incorporated by reference in any Registration Statement, prospectus,
preliminary prospectus, freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), offering circular, or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by
reference therein, (ii) any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (iii) any violation (or alleged violation) by NewCo of the
Securities Act, any similar federal or state securities laws or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to NewCo and relating to any
action or inaction required of NewCo in connection with any registration of
securities, and NewCo will reimburse such IAC Covered Person for any legal or
other expenses

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably incurred by such IAC Covered Person in connection with
investigating and defending or settling any such loss, claim, action, damage
or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo shall not be so liable in
any such case to the extent that any such claim, action, loss, damage or
liability arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, or omission or alleged omission, action or violation made or
incorporated by reference in any such Registration Statement, prospectus,
preliminary prospectus, freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), offering circular, or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by
reference therein in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
information prepared and furnished to NewCo by such IAC Covered Person or
prepared on behalf of NewCo by such IAC Covered Person expressly for use
therein; _provided further_ , _however_ , that, except as provided in the
penultimate sentence of _Section 2.7(c)_ of this Agreement, the indemnity
agreement contained in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall not apply to amounts paid
in settlement of any loss, action, claim, damage or liability if such
settlement is effected without the consent of NewCo (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). This indemnity shall be in addition to
any liability NewCo may otherwise have.

 



 

(b) IAC shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
harmless NewCo and each of its Affiliates (other than IAC and its
Subsidiaries), officers, directors, employees and partners, legal counsel, and
accountants (each, a " _NewCo Covered Person_ ") against any losses, claims,
actions, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel and other professional advisors), joint or several, to
which such NewCo Covered Person may become subject under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, any state "blue sky" securities law, any equivalent non-U.S.
securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, actions,
damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained or
incorporated by reference in any Registration Statement, prospectus,
preliminary prospectus, freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), offering circular, or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by
reference therein, (ii) any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not

and IAC will reimburse such NewCo Covered Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such NewCo Covered Person in connection with
investigating and defending or settling any such loss, claim, action, damage
or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that IAC shall not be so liable in any
such case to the extent that any such claim, action, loss, damage or liability

or omission or alleged omission, action or violation made or incorporated by
reference in any such Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary
prospectus, freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), offering circular, or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by
reference therein in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
information prepared and furnished to IAC or prepared on behalf of IAC by such
NewCo Covered Person expressly for use therein; _provided further_ , _however_
, that, except as provided in the penultimate sentence of _Section 2.7(c)_ of
this Agreement, the indemnity agreement contained in this _Section 2.7(b)_
shall not apply to amounts

 



      
 

 



 

paid in settlement of any loss, action, claim, damage or liability if such
settlement is effected without the consent of IAC (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided further_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the amount that IAC shall be required to pay or contribute
pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)_ exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds
(after deducting any Selling Expenses paid by IAC) actually received by IAC in
the sale of Registrable Securities that give rise to such obligation to pay or
contribute, except in the case of intentional misrepresentation by IAC or such
IAC Covered Person. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability IAC
may otherwise have.

 



 

(c) Each Party entitled to indemnification under this _Section 2.7_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give written notice to the Party required to
provide indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may
be sought; _provided_ that any failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
reason of such failure or delay. In case a claim or an action that is subject
or potentially subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party as promptly as practicable after receipt of written notice
from such Indemnified Party of such claim or action, to assume, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, the defense of any such claim or action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall
conduct the defense of such claim or any action resulting therefrom, shall be
approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at the
Indemnified Partys expense (and with counsel of its own choice); _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to
reimburse the Indemnified Party for any fees, costs or expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense if (A) the
Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees, costs and expenses,
(B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such claim or
action within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim or
action, (C) having assumed the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnifying Party fails to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party or to pursue the defense of such claim or action in a
reasonably vigorous manner, (D) the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying
Party to represent the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest or (E) the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded
that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to it
and/or any other Indemnified Party that is or are different from or additional
to those available to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to the third proviso in
the foregoing sentence, no Indemnifying Party shall, in connection with any
one claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related actions
in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general circumstances or
allegations, be liable for the fees, costs and expenses of more than one firm
of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction)
for all Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to settle a claim or action for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to such
claim or action unless such judgment or settlement does not impose any
admission of wrongdoing or ongoing obligations on any Indemnified Party and
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff therein to such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

acceptable to such Indemnified Party, of a full and final release from all
liability in respect of such claim or action. Except in the case of a judgment
or settlement effected in the circumstances described in clause (B) or (D) of
the third proviso to the first sentence of this _Section 2.7(c)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable hereunder for any amount paid or
payable incurred pursuant to or in connection with any judgment entered or
settlement effected with the consent of an Indemnified Party unless the
Indemnifying Party has also consented to such judgment or settlement (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each
Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim
in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as
shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and
action resulting therefrom.

 



 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.7_ is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to, or unenforceable by, an
Indemnified Party in respect of any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense
referred to herein, then the applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability,
claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and of the
Indemnified Party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Party, on the
other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, whether the violation of the
Securities Act or any other federal or state securities law or rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to NewCo and relating to any
action or inaction required of NewCo in connection with any registration of
securities was perpetrated by the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party,
and the Parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission or violation. The
Parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
hereto were determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any other method or
allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations
referred to in this _Section 2.7(d)_. No Indemnified Party guilty or liable
of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act shall be entitled to contribution from any Person that was not
guilty of such fraudulent representation.

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party or an officer, director or Affiliate of such Indemnified
Party and shall survive the transfer of securities and any termination of this
Agreement, but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities
made before the termination date.

 



 

(f) Disputes, controversies and claims under this _Section 2.7_ shall be
subject to the terms of Article 7 and Sections 10.01 and 10.09 of the
Contribution Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale
of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, NewCo agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to:

 



       
 

 



 

(a) make and keep public information regarding NewCo available as those terms
are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times
from and after ninety (90) days following the Merger Effective Time;

 



 

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of NewCo under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time
after it has become subject to such reporting requirements; and

 



 

(c) so long as IAC owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to IAC promptly
upon written request a written statement by NewCo as to its compliance with
the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at any time from and after ninety (90)
days following the Merger Effective Time), and of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting
requirements), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of NewCo,
and such other reports and documents so filed as IAC may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing IAC to sell any
such securities without registration.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date of this Agreement, NewCo shall not, without the prior written consent
of IAC, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any
securities of NewCo giving such holder or prospective holder any registration
rights the terms of which are _pari passu_ with or senior to the registration
rights granted to IAC pursuant to this _Article II_. For these purposes, as
to Form S-3 registration rights, _pari passu_ and seniority shall refer to
priority in underwriter cut-backs.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Termination of Registration Rights_. The right of IAC to request
registration or inclusion in any registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
_Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.3_ and the limitations on NewCo with respect to
the granting of subsequent registration rights pursuant to _Section 2.9_
shall terminate on such date on which IAC and any other members of the IAC
Group cease to hold Registrable Securities.

ANTI-DILUTION

 



 

Section 3.1 _Anti-Dilution Rights_.

 



 

(a) In the event that, after the Merger Effective Time, NewCo issues or
proposes to issue (other than to a member of the IAC Group and other than
pursuant to an Excluded Issuance) any shares of NewCo Common Stock, including
shares of NewCo Common Stock issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange of
options, warrants and convertible securities (excluding shares of NewCo Class
A Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of NewCo Class B Common Stock)
(each such issuance, an " _Additional Issuance_ "), IAC shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to purchase or to cause one or more other members of
the IAC Group to purchase for cash at a price per share equal to the Issue
Price:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) in the case of an Additional Issuance of NewCo Voting Stock, up to a
number of shares of the class of the NewCo Voting Stock to be issued in the
Additional Issuance and/or one (1) or more other classes of NewCo Voting Stock
then authorized as is necessary for the IAC Group to maintain (after giving
effect to the Additional Issuance and any issuance of NewCo Voting Stock to
the IAC Group pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)(i)_) ownership of NewCo Voting
Stock resulting in the IAC Groups Voting Interest and Equity Interest being
equal to the IAC Groups Voting Interest and Equity Interest immediately prior
to the Additional Issuance; _provided_ that if, in light of the classes of
NewCo Voting Stock and the number of shares thereof then authorized and the
relative number of outstanding shares of each class of NewCo Common Stock then
held by members of the IAC Group and other Persons, it is not possible for IAC
to so maintain the IAC Groups Voting Interest and Equity Interest through
such a purchase, then IAC may determine, in its sole discretion, to purchase
(or to cause one or more other members of the IAC Group to purchase) up to
such number of shares of such class(es) of NewCo Common Stock then authorized
(including any class of stock proposed to be issued in the Additional Issuance
if not yet authorized) as it shall determine so long as such purchase would
not result in the IAC Groups Voting Interest or, subject to _Section
3.1(a)(ii)_, Equity Interest exceeding the IAC Groups Voting Interest or
Equity Interest, respectively, immediately prior to the Additional Issuance;
or

 



 

(ii) in the case of an Additional Issuance of NewCo Non-voting Stock, up to a
number of shares of such class or classes of NewCo Non-voting Stock as is
necessary for the IAC Group to maintain (after giving effect to the Additional
Issuance and any issuance of NewCo Non-voting Stock to the IAC Group pursuant
to this _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_) ownership of (A) NewCo Common Stock resulting
in the IAC Groups Equity Interest being equal to the IAC Groups Equity
Interest immediately prior to the Additional Issuance and (B) at least 80.1%
of the issued and outstanding shares of each class of NewCo Non-voting Stock,
without regard to whether the IAC Group owned any shares of such class of
NewCo Non-voting Stock before such Additional Issuance(s).

 



 

(b) NewCo shall give immediate written notice (an " _Issuance Notice_ ") to
IAC upon NewCo (x) having received notice of an intended exercise, conversion
or exchange of options, warrants or convertible securities (other than a
notice requesting conversion of shares of NewCo Class B Common Stock into
shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock) or (y) otherwise intending to issue to a
third party (other than to a member of the IAC Group) any shares of NewCo
Common Stock or any option, warrant, convertible security or other instrument
convertible or exchangeable into shares of NewCo Common Stock; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that NewCo shall not be required to give notice to IAC pursuant to
this _Section 3.1(b)_ unless the Additional Issuance resulting from the
actions in clause (x) or (y) represents in excess of one-half of one percent
(0.5%) of the Total Equity Interests before giving effect to such Additional
Issuance; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that, if such Additional
Issuance, taken together with any prior Additional Issuance(s) with respect to
which IAC was not entitled to receive notice pursuant to the previous proviso,
exceeds one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Total Equity Interests after
giving effect to the contemplated Additional Issuance and such previous

 



      
 

 



 

Additional Issuance(s), NewCo shall then be required to provide immediate
written notice to IAC of such Additional Issuance and all such previous
Additional Issuances for which IAC has not received notice. The Issuance
Notice shall specify: (i) the class of NewCo Common Stock to be issued (or
that has been issued), (ii) if such shares are of a class not previously
issued, a description of the rights of such shares, (iii) the number of shares
proposed to be issued (or that have been issued), (iv) the Issue Price (if
known) per share, and (v) the anticipated effective date of the Additional
Issuance (which, in the case of issuance described in clause (y), shall be a
date that is no earlier than the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after
the date of the Issuance Notice) and the effective date of any previously
completed Additional Issuance for which IAC has become eligible to receive
notice pursuant to the second proviso of this _Section 3.1(b)_. IAC may
exercise its rights to purchase NewCo Common Stock pursuant to this _Section
3.1_ by sending an irrevocable written notice to NewCo (a " _Purchase Election
Notice_ ") not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of an
Issuance Notice (or, if later, two (2) Business Days following the
determination of the Issue Price) from NewCo that it elects to purchase or to
cause one or more members of the IAC Group to purchase all or a portion of
such NewCo Common Stock (the " _IAC Additional Shares_ ").

 



 

(c) If a Purchase Election Notice is sent on or prior to the date on which
shares of NewCo Common Stock are being issued pursuant to an Additional
Issuance (or the date on which the Additional Issuance is deemed effective, if
earlier) (such date, the " _Additional Issuance Date_ "), but subject to the
occurrence of the Additional Issuance, (i) the closing of the purchase of the
IAC Additional Shares shall occur on the later of (A) the Additional Issuance
Date and (B) the date on which all necessary approvals from Governmental
Authorities relating to the IAC Additional Shares have been received (the "
_IAC Ownership Date_ "), (ii) IAC (or such member of the IAC Group designated
by IAC), as of the IAC Ownership Date, shall be considered the owner of the
IAC Additional Shares purchased pursuant to this _Section 3.1_ and (iii) as
of the IAC Ownership Date, IAC (or such member of the IAC Group designated by
IAC) shall possess all incidents, benefits and burdens of ownership of such
NewCo Common Stock, including the right to appreciation in value, the risk of
depreciation in value, the right to vote the shares, the right to dividends
with respect to the shares, and the right to sell, pledge, hypothecate or
otherwise dispose of such shares, in each case, as of immediately prior to the
Additional Issuance. At the closing of the purchase and sale on the IAC
Ownership Date, NewCo shall deliver to IAC (or such member of the IAC Group
designated by IAC), against payment therefor, certificates or book-entry
shares (issued in the name of IAC or a member of the IAC Group) representing
the shares of NewCo Common Stock being purchased pursuant to this _Section
3.1_ and shall cause the IAC Additional Shares to be recorded in the stock
transfer books of NewCo.

 



 

(d) If a Purchase Election Notice is sent after the Additional Issuance Date,
the closing of the purchase of IAC Additional Shares shall occur on the later
of the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of the Purchase
Election Notice by IAC and the date that is five (5) Business Days after
receipt of any necessary approvals from Governmental Authorities.

fails to give such notice in a timely manner, then IAC shall be deemed to have
nominated the incumbent IAC Directors in a timely manner (unless the number of
incumbent IAC Directors is less than the number of IAC Nominees IAC is
entitled to nominate pursuant to clause (a) above, in which case NewCo and IAC
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to mutually agree on a
nominee or nominees to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) above).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 4.2(e)_, NewCo and the Board of Directors shall cause
each IAC Nominee nominated in accordance with _Section 4.2(a)_ to be included
in managements slate of nominees for election as a director at each Election

(d) NewCo shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Board of Directors to, cause the election of each IAC

supporting the IAC Nominee for election in a manner no less rigorous and
favorable than the manner in which NewCo supports the other nominees).

 



 

(e) If any IAC Nominee (i) is unable to serve as a nominee for appointment as
of the Merger Effective Time or for election as a director or to serve as a
director, for any reason, thereafter (ii) ceases to continue as a director
(upon death, resignation or otherwise) or fails to be elected at an Election
Meeting solely as a result of such IAC Nominee failing to receive a plurality
of the votes cast, or (iii) is to be substituted by IAC (with the relevant IAC
Nominees consent and resignation) for election at an Election Meeting, IAC
shall have the right to submit the name of a replacement for each such IAC
Nominee (each an " _IAC Replacement_ ") and who shall serve as the nominee for
election as director or serve as director in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 4.2_. An IAC Nominee shall, at the time of nomination and at all
times thereafter until such individuals service on the Board of Directors
ceases, meet any applicable requirements or qualifications under applicable
law or applicable stock exchange rules.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Election and Appointment of ANGI Directors_.

 



 

(a) During the Initial Governance Period, (i) in connection with each Election
Meeting, the Board of Directors shall nominate the ANGI Directors (or, if
applicable, an ANGI Replacement) (each, an " _ANGI Nominee_ ") for election in
accordance with the Bylaws of NewCo and (ii) IAC shall, and shall cause any
member of the IAC Group to, (A) cause their respective shares of NewCo capital

(b) If, prior to expiration of the Initial Governance Period, either ANGI
Director (i) is unable or unwilling to serve as a nominee for appointment as
of the Merger Effective Time or for election as a director or to serve as a
director, for any reason, thereafter, or (ii) ceases to continue as a director
(upon death, resignation or otherwise), or fails to be elected at an Election
Meeting solely as a result of such ANGI Nominee failing to receive a plurality
of the votes cast (other than as a result of a breach by IAC of _Section
4.3(a)_ hereof), the Board of Directors shall select a replacement for such
ANGI Director (an " _ANGI Replacement_ "), which ANGI Replacement at such time
(i) (A) must qualify to serve as an independent director of NewCo if such
replaced ANGI Director qualified to serve as an independent director of NewCo
at the time he or she ceased to be able or willing to serve or ceased to
continue as a director of NewCo, as the case may be, or (B) must, in all other
cases, qualify to serve as an independent director of IAC (were such
individual to be appointed at such time to the Board of Directors of

 



      
 

 



 

IAC), and (ii) must be reasonably acceptable to the remaining ANGI Director
(if any), and who shall serve as the nominee for election as director or serve

stock exchange rules.

 



 

(c) If both ANGI Directors (i) are unable or unwilling to serve as nominees
for appointment as of the Merger Effective Time or for election as directors
or to serve as directors, for any reason, thereafter, or (ii) cease to
continue as directors (upon death, resignation or otherwise) or fail to be
elected at an Election Meeting solely as a result of such ANGI Nominees
failing to receive a plurality of the votes cast (other than as a result of a
breach by IAC of _Section 4.3(a)_ hereof), then the provisions set forth in
_Section 4.1(b)_, _Section 4.3(a)_, _Section 4.3(b)_, _Section 4.5(a)_ and
_Section 4.5(b)_ shall be void and of no further force an effect.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Fees and Expenses; Indemnification_. Each IAC Nominee and ANGI
Nominee elected to the Board of Directors will be entitled to compensation and
other benefits consistent with the compensation and benefits paid or made
available to the other directors serving on the Board of Directors who are not
executive officers or employees of NewCo, and NewCo will reimburse each IAC
Nominee and ANGI Nominee for his or her reasonable expenses, consistent with
NewCos policy for such reimbursement in effect from time to time, incurred by
attending meetings of the Board of Directors and/or any committee of the Board
of Directors. NewCo shall indemnify, or provide for the indemnification of,
including, subject to applicable law, any rights to the advancement of fees
and expenses, to the IAC Nominee and ANGI Nominees and provide the IAC

extent it indemnifies and provides insurance for the non-employee members of
the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Board Committees_.

 



 

(a) During the Initial Governance Period, IAC and NewCo agree that the Board
of Directors shall not utilize committees of the Board of Directors for the
purpose of discriminating against the ANGI Directors in order to limit their
participation in substantive deliberations of the Board of Directors, except
that the Board of Directors may utilize committees in order to limit the
participation of any director to the extent that a majority of the independent
directors (for this purpose not counting the director who may have a material
conflict of interest in the numerator or denominator) reasonably determines in
good faith that doing so is advisable due to a conflict of interest.

 



 

(b) During the Initial Governance Period, at least one (1) of the members of
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors shall be an ANGI Director so
long as the ANGI director qualifies as "independent" pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and is otherwise
eligible for membership on an Audit Committee of a board of directors of a
corporation listed on NASDAQ.

 



 

(c) Among other powers and responsibilities as delegated to the Audit
Committee from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors shall be responsible (i) for compliance with Section
5630 of the NASDAQ listing rules

 



      
 

 



 

or any successor thereto, whether or not NewCo ceases to be listed on the
NASDAQ, and (ii) for reviewing any proposed amendments or waivers by NewCo of
any term of this Agreement or the Other Ancillary Agreements (other than any
amendments or waivers that are immaterial in nature).

OTHER AGREEMENTS

 



 

Section 5.1 _Future Transactions_. If IAC advises NewCo, at any time, that IAC
intends to dispose of all or a portion of its interest in NewCo (including by
way of a distribution to IACs stockholders), NewCo agrees to cooperate and

who qualify as independent directors are then serving on the Board of
Directors.

(e) "herein," "hereby," "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto" and words of similar

provision hereof or thereof;

 



 

(f) "including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including,
without limiting the generality of, any description preceding such term;

 



 

(g) the Table of Contents and headings are for convenience of reference only

certain of the Other Ancillary Agreements by facsimile, stamp or mechanical
signature. Each of NewCo and IAC expressly adopts and confirms each such
facsimile, stamp or mechanical signature made in its respective name (or that
of the applicable member of its Group) as if it were a manual signature,
agrees that it will not assert that any such signature is not adequate to bind
such Party to the same extent as if it were signed manually and agrees that at
the reasonable request of the other Party at any time it will as promptly as
reasonably practicable cause each such Other Ancillary Agreement to be
manually executed (any such execution to be as of the date of the initial date
thereof).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Assignability_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in any Other Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement and
each Other Ancillary Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties hereto and thereto, respectively, and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as contemplated
in this _Section 6.6_ or as specifically provided in any Other Ancillary
Agreement, no Party hereto or thereto may assign its respective rights or
delegate its respective obligations under this Agreement or any Other
Ancillary Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other
parties hereto or thereto.

 



 

(b) In the event IAC desires to effect a spin-off, split-off or similar
transaction (however effected) in which the equity interests of a Subsidiary
of IAC holding IACs interest in NewCo are distributed or otherwise
transferred, directly or indirectly, to the holders of one or more classes of
IACs capital stock, then, upon IACs written request, NewCo, IAC and such
Subsidiary of IAC shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to effect
(i) the assignment by IAC of its rights hereunder to such Subsidiary of IAC
and (ii) the acceptance of such rights and assumption of IACs obligations
hereunder by such Subsidiary of IAC (in each case of clauses (i) and (ii)
effective prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of such

 



      
 

 



 

transaction), and (iii) the acknowledgement by NewCo that IAC shall thereafter
have no liability hereunder (except for any liability arising from any breach
by IAC or relating to any actions or events occurring, in each case, on or
prior to the date of the spin-off, split-off or similar transaction).

 



 

(c) In the event (i) IAC desires to sell or transfer twenty percent (20%) or
more of IACs Equity Interest during the Initial Governance Period to an
unaffiliated third party or (ii) IAC determines to distribute its equity
interest in NewCo to IACs stockholders and as a result, to IACs knowledge, a
Person will hold twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding equity
interests in NewCo, as a condition to any such sale, transfer or distribution,
the party acquiring the twenty percent (20%) or greater equity interest
described in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, must agree in writing to
assume IACs obligations under this Agreement (unless the transaction will
result in the acquiring party acquiring 100% of the capital stock of NewCo).
In the event IAC desires to sell or transfer any of IACs Equity Interest
during the Initial Governance Period to an Affiliate of IAC (other than by way
of a distribution to all of IACs stockholders), as a condition to any such
sale or transfer, such Affiliate must agree in writing to assume IACs
obligations under this Agreement (unless the transaction will result in the
acquiring Affiliate acquiring 100% of the capital stock of NewCo).

 



 

Section 6.7 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) the indemnification
rights under this Agreement of any NewCo Covered Person or any IAC Covered
Person in their respective capacities as such and (ii) as specifically
provided in any Other Ancillary Agreement:

 



 

(a) the provisions of this Agreement and each Other Ancillary Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto and thereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and are not intended to confer upon any
Person, except the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder; and

 



 

(b) there are no third party beneficiaries of this Agreement or any Other
Ancillary Agreement; and neither this Agreement nor any Other Ancillary
Agreement shall provide any third party with any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, claim of action or other right in excess of those existing
without reference to this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions or other appropriate equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and each Other Ancillary
Agreement, shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of the choice of

Section 6.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any Other

is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof or thereof, or the application
of such provision to Persons or circumstances or in jurisdictions other than
those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in
full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, as the case may be, is not affected in any
manner adverse to either Party hereto or any Party thereto. Upon such
determination, the relevant Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort
to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision to effect the original
intent of the Parties.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Waivers of Default; Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so
waiving. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any
provision of this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement shall not be
deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default, nor
shall it prejudice the rights of the other Party. No failure or delay by any
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of NewCo and IAC acknowledges that each of the Parties and each
member of their respective Group are all currently represented by members of
IACs legal department and IACs outside counsel. IAC (on behalf of itself and
every member of its Group), on the one hand, and NewCo (on behalf of itself
and every member of its Group), on the other hand, waives any conflict with
respect to such common representation that may arise before, at or after the
Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written instrument signed by the Parties which, unless the Merger Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms or the Merger Effective Time
shall have occurred, shall not become effective unless the Company has
provided its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that, during the
Initial Governance Period, _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.5_,
_Section 5.1_, _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.2_, _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.6_
or this _Section 6.13_ (to the extent such sections have not been voided
pursuant to other provision of this Agreement) may not be amended by IAC and
NewCo, or waivers therefrom granted, which amendment or waiver would adversely
affect the rights of the holders of NewCo Class A Common Stock, without
receiving the prior consent of a majority of the holders of NewCo Class A
Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have signed this Agreement effective as of the
date first set forth above.

non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable (as

in any Licensed IAC Intellectual Property, whether contained in the Excluded
Assets or Deferred Transfer Assets to: (i) make, have made, import, use, offer
to sell, sell and otherwise commercialize any products and services; and (ii)
use, copy, distribute, modify, make, improve, disclose, display, sublicense

Property in the ordinary course of their businesses; or (ii) assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, except (subject to _Section 2.15(d)_) in
connection with a change of control of a member of the HomeAdvisor Group, or
the transfer or sale of any business unit, division or a member of the
HomeAdvisor Group (by means of a reorganization, asset sale, stock sale,
merger or otherwise) of the HomeAdvisor Group. NewCo and any other member of
the HomeAdvisor Group may permit their suppliers, contractors and consultants
to exercise any or all of the rights and licenses granted to NewCo and the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a transaction whereby an entity
that was a Subsidiary of NewCo engaged in a line of business ceases to be a
member of the HomeAdvisor Group (each, a " _HomeAdvisor Spin-Out_ "), such
entity may retain, by way of a sublicense, any licenses granted or sublicensed
to it hereunder, but only with respect to the line of business in which it is
engaged at the time of such HomeAdvisor Spin-Out and natural extensions
thereof. In the event that such entity resulting from the HomeAdvisor Spin-Out
is acquired by a third Person, such sublicense will not extend to any
products, business or operations of such third Person.

majority of the outstanding equity interests in NewCo, upon reasonable request
by NewCo and at NewCos expense, IAC shall deliver to NewCo copies of the
tangible embodiments of the Licensed IAC Intellectual Property.

(a) NewCo, on behalf of itself and the HomeAdvisor Group, hereby grants to IAC
and the other members of the IAC Group a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual,

display, sublicense and otherwise exploit in any manner any technology,
products and services in connection with the operation of the businesses of
IAC or any other member of the IAC Group.

 



 

(b) The licenses granted to IAC and the other members of the IAC Group under
this _Section 2.16_ may not be: (i) sublicensed, except in connection with
the license of the IAC Groups own Intellectual Property in the ordinary
course of their businesses; or (ii) assigned or transferred, in whole or in
part, except (subject to _Section 2.16(d)_) in connection with a change of

asset sale, stock sale, merger or otherwise) of the IAC Group. IAC and any
other member of the IAC Group may permit their suppliers, contractors and
consultants to exercise any or all of the rights and licenses granted to IAC

hereunder.

 



 

(d) The rights and licenses granted to any Subsidiary of IAC under this
_Section 2.16_ shall apply only while such entity is and remains a member of
the IAC Group. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, in the event of a transaction whereby an entity that was a
Subsidiary of IAC engaged in a line of business ceases to be a member of the
IAC Group (each, an " _IAC Spin-Out_ "), such entity may retain, by way of a
sublicense, any licenses granted or sublicensed to it hereunder, but only with
respect to the line of business in which it is engaged at the time of such IAC

majority of the outstanding equity interests in NewCo, upon reasonable request
by IAC, NewCo shall deliver to IAC copies of all tangible embodiments of the
Licensed HomeAdvisor Intellectual Property.

 



 

(f) All rights and licenses granted under this _Section 2.16_ are, and shall
otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy
Code, licenses of rights to "intellectual property" as defined under Section
101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Parties and their Affiliates shall retain
and may fully exercise all of their respective rights and elections under the
Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3**

 



 

 **DEFERRED SEPARATION TRANSACTIONS**

 



 

Section 3.01 _Deferred Transfer Assets_.

 



 

(a) If the transfer to any member of the HomeAdvisor Group of any Asset that
would otherwise constitute a HomeAdvisor Asset (a " _Deferred HomeAdvisor
Asset_ ") or the transfer to any member of the IAC Group of any Asset that
would otherwise constitute an Excluded Asset (a " _Deferred Excluded Asset_ ,"
and together with a Deferred HomeAdvisor Asset, a " _Deferred Transfer Asset_
") cannot be accomplished without giving rise to a violation of Applicable
Law, or without obtaining a Third Party Consent or a Governmental
Authorization (collectively, a " _Transfer Impediment_ ") and any such Third
Party Consent or Governmental Authorization has not been obtained prior to the
Contribution Effective Time, then such Asset shall be dealt with in the manner
described in this _Section 3.01_.

 



 

(b) Pending removal of such Transfer Impediment, the Person holding the
Deferred Transfer Asset (the " _Retaining Person_ ") shall hold such Deferred
Transfer Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of the
Party to whom the transfer of such Asset could not be made at the Contribution
Effective Time (the " _Deferred Beneficiary_ "). The Retaining Person shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve such Asset and its right,
title and interest therein and take all such other action as may reasonably be
requested by the Deferred Beneficiary (in each case, at such Deferred
Beneficiarys expense) in order to place such Deferred Beneficiary, insofar as
reasonably possible, in the same position as it would be in if such Asset had
been transferred to it or retained by it with effect as of the Contribution
Effective Time and so that, subject to the standard of care set forth above,
all the benefits and burdens relating to such Deferred Transfer Asset,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, enforcement of
rights against third parties and dominion, control and command over such
Asset, are to inure from and after the Contribution Effective Time to such
Deferred Beneficiary and the members of its Group. The provisions set forth in
this _Article 3_ contain all the obligations of the Retaining Person vis-a-
vis the Deferred Beneficiary with respect to the Deferred Transfer Asset and
the Retaining Person shall not be bound vis-a-vis the Deferred Beneficiary by
any other obligations under Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall continue on and after the Contribution Effective Time to
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove all Transfer Impediments;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party

 



      
 

 



 

shall be required to make any unreasonable payment or assume any material
obligations therefor. As and when any Transfer Impediment is removed, the
relevant Deferred Transfer Asset shall forthwith be transferred to its
Deferred Beneficiary at no additional cost and in a manner and on terms
consistent with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the Other
Ancillary Agreements, including _Section 2.14(b)_ hereof, and any such
transfer shall take effect as of the date of its actual transfer.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of Applicable Law, a
Retaining Person shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to
expend any money in respect of a Deferred Transfer Asset unless the necessary
funds are advanced by the Deferred Beneficiary of such Deferred Transfer
Asset, other than reasonable attorneys fees and recording or similar fees,
all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Deferred Beneficiary of such
Deferred Transfer Asset.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Unreleased Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) If at any time on or after the Contribution Effective Time, any member of
the HomeAdvisor Group or the IAC Group shall remain obligated to any Third
Party in respect of any Liability of the other Party or its Group (such other
Party with respect such Unreleased Liability and such Unreleased Person, the "
_Responsible Party_ "), the following provisions shall apply. The Liabilities
referred to in this _Section 3.02_ are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Unreleased Liabilities_ ," the Person remaining obligated for such Liability
in a manner contrary to what is intended under this Agreement is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Unreleased Person_ ," such Unreleased Persons Party,
the " _Unreleased Party_ " and such Unreleased Persons Group, the "
_Unreleased Group_ ".

 



 

(b) Each Unreleased Person shall remain obligated to Third Parties for such
Unreleased Liability as provided in the relevant Contract, Applicable Law or
other source of such Unreleased Liability and shall pay and perform such
Unreleased Liability as and when required, in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) Each Responsible Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
HomeAdvisor Indemnified Party or IAC Indemnified Party, as the context
requires, that is an Unreleased Person from and against any Liabilities
arising in respect of each Unreleased Liability of such Unreleased Person that
is a Liability of such Responsible Party. Each Responsible Party shall take,
and shall cause the members of its Group (the " _Responsible Group_ ") to
take, such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the applicable
Unreleased Party in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in order
to place the applicable Unreleased Group, insofar as reasonably possible, in
the same position as it would be in if such Unreleased Liability had been
fully contributed, assigned, transferred, conveyed, and delivered to, and
accepted and assumed or retained, as applicable, by such Responsible Party (or
any relevant member of the Responsible Group) with effect as of the
Contribution Effective Time and so that all the benefits and burdens relating
to such Unreleased Liability, including possession, use, risk of loss,
potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Unreleased
Liability, are to inure from and after the Contribution Effective Time to the
member or members of the Responsible Group.

 



 

(d) Each Responsible Party shall continue on and after the Contribution
Effective Time to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Unreleased Persons to be released from their respective Unreleased
Liabilities.

 



 

(e) If, as and when it becomes possible to delegate, novate or extinguish any
Unreleased Liability in favor of an Unreleased Person, the relevant Parties
shall promptly sign all such documents and perform all such other acts, and
shall cause each member of their respective Groups, as applicable, to sign all
such documents and perform all such other acts, as may be necessary or
desirable to

 



      
 

 



 

give effect to such delegation, novation, extinction or other release without
payment of any further consideration by the Unreleased Person.

 



 

Section 3.03 _No Additional Consideration_. For the avoidance of doubt, the

hereof shall release any member of the HomeAdvisor Group from honoring its

(d) NewCo shall not make, and shall not permit any other member of the

Section 5.04 _Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) All claims for indemnification relating to a Third Party Claim by any
indemnified party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") hereunder shall be asserted and
resolved as set forth in this _Section 5.04_.

 



 

(b) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified
Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Party by a Third Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days
following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third
Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, and any other
material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure
has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser number of days
set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by a court proceeding in the
event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice
Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that in the event
a Claim Notice in respect of indemnification sought pursuant to _Section
5.02(d)_ so specifies, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to require
the Indemnifying Party, and in such event the Indemnifying Party shall be
required, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the Indemnifying Partys expense.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Partys expense.
Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense at its
expense, _provided_ that such expense shall be the responsibility of the
Indemnifying Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for
expenses in respect of more than one counsel for the Indemnified Party in any
single jurisdiction), or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently defend
a Third Party Claim it has assumed the defense of, as provided in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.04(c)_. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or
offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would
result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Applicable
Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates or (iii) a finding or admission that would have an adverse
effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third Party Claim or after receiving a Claim Notice

 



      
 

 



 

specified in the proviso to the last sentence of _Section 5.04(b)_, fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim
within ten (10) days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party
to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it
being understood that the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a
Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including by
providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees; it being understood that the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be Liabilities,
subject to indemnification.

 



 

(f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with Applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing either party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as
to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Procedures for Indemnification of Direct Claims_. Any claim for
indemnification made directly by the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party that does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be
asserted by written notice from the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party specifically claiming indemnification hereunder. Such Indemnifying Party
shall have a period of 45 days after the receipt of such notice within which
to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such
45-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted
responsibility to make payment and shall have no further right to contest the
validity of such claim. If such Indemnifying Party does respond within such
45-day period and rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue resolution as provided in _Article 7_.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Adjustments to Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) If an Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Liabilities and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all
or a part of such Liabilities from a Third Party (a " _Potential Contributor_
") based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
are necessary to permit such Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

 



 

(b) If notwithstanding _Section 5.07_ an Indemnified Party receives an amount
from a Third Party in respect of a Liability that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Liability has been
paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of
(i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Liability,
plus the amount received from the Third Party in respect thereof, over (ii)
the full amount of the Liability.

 



 

(c) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be
relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of
the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with
respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or
any other Third Party shall be entitled to a "wind-fall" (i.e., a benefit they
would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification
provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.07 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this _Article 5_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed backup documentation, for a Liability
that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying
Party in good faith disputes the Liability, in which event it shall so notify
the Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
of any Liability for which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) days
following any final determination of such Liability and the Indemnifying
Partys liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (a) the
parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (b) a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or
judgment, or (c) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-
appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to
submit thereto.

 



 

Section 5.08 _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this
_Article 5_ shall, for any reason, be unavailable or insufficient to hold
harmless the Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any Liability, then
each Indemnifying Party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Liability, in such proportion as shall be sufficient to place the
Indemnified Party in the same position as if such Indemnified Party were
indemnified hereunder, the Parties intending that their respective
contributions hereunder be as close as possible to the indemnification under
_Section 5.02_ and _Section 5.03_. If the contribution provided for in the
previous sentence shall, for any reason, be unavailable or insufficient to put
the Indemnified Party in the same position as if it were indemnified under
_Section 5.02_ or _Section 5.03_, as the case may be, then the Indemnifying
Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party
as a result of such Liability, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by and the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other hand
with respect to the matter giving rise to the Liability.

 



 

Section 5.09 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this _Article 5_
shall be cumulative and, subject to the provisions of _Article 7_, shall not
preclude assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking
of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Survival of Indemnities_. The rights and obligations of NewCo,
IAC and their respective Indemnified Parties under this _Article 5_ shall
survive the distribution, sale or other transfer by any Party of any Assets or
the delegation or assignment by it of any Liabilities.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Shared Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(a) In order to facilitate the defense of any Shared Liability, each of NewCo
and IAC agrees that (i) NewCo and IAC shall cooperate in the defense of any
Shared Liability; (ii) each of NewCo and IAC shall be responsible for the
costs of its own in-house counsel and other internal personnel in the defense
of any Shared Liability; (iii) IAC shall be entitled to control the defense
and/or settlement of any Shared Liability, although NewCo shall be entitled to
observe with counsel of its own selection and at its own expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Contribution Effective Time IAC shall not settle
all or any portion of any Shared Liability unless any remaining Liability of
NewCo and its Affiliates and their respective current and former officers and
directors relating to the Shared Liability will be fully released as a result
of such settlement.

 



 

(b) Each of NewCo and IAC agrees to act in good faith and to use their
reasonable best efforts to preserve and maximize the insurance benefits due to
be provided under all policies

 



      
 

 



 

of insurance and to cooperate with one another as necessary to permit each
other to access or obtain the benefits under those policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing hereunder shall be construed to prevent either Party
or any other Person from asserting claims for insurance benefits or accepting
insurance benefits provided by the policies. Each of NewCo and IAC agrees to
exchange information upon reasonable request of the other Party regarding
requests that they have made for insurance benefits, notices of claims,
occurrences and circumstances that they have submitted to the insurance
companies or other entities managing the policies, responses they have
received from those insurance companies or entities, including any payments
they have received from the insurance companies and any agreements by the
insurance companies to make payments, and any other information that the
Parties may need to determine the status of the insurance policies and the
continued availability of benefits thereunder.

 



 

(c) If NewCo or IAC receives notice or otherwise learns of the assertion by
any person or entity (including a Governmental Authority) of a Shared
Liability, that Party shall give the other Parties written notice of such
Shared Liability, providing notice of such Shared Liability in reasonable
detail. The failure to give notice under this paragraph (c) shall not relieve
any Party of its Liability for any Shared Liability except to the extent the
Party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The Parties
shall be deemed to be on notice of any Shared Liability pending prior to the
Contribution Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Insurance Matters_.

 



 

(a) NewCo does hereby, for itself and each other member of the HomeAdvisor
Group, agree that no member of the IAC Group or any IAC Indemnified Party
shall have any liability whatsoever as a result of the insurance policies and
practices of IAC and its Affiliates as in effect at any time prior to the
Contribution Effective Time, including as a result of the level or scope of
any such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier, the terms
and conditions of any policy, the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any
insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or otherwise;
provided this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall not negate IACs agreement under
_Section 5.01(a)_.

 



 

(b) IAC agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the interest and
rights of NewCo and the other members of the HomeAdvisor Group as of the
Contribution Effective Time as insureds or beneficiaries or in any other
capacity under occurrence-based insurance policies and programs (and under
claims-made policies and programs to the extent a claim has been submitted
prior to the Contribution Effective Time) of IAC or any other member of the
IAC Group in respect of periods prior to the Contribution Effective Time to
survive the Contribution Effective Time for the period for which such

continue to administer such policies and programs on behalf of NewCo and the
other relevant members of the HomeAdvisor Group, subject to NewCos
reimbursement to IAC and the other relevant members of the IAC Group for the

least ten percent of his or her normal working time over any ten (10) Business
Days working with respect to any such matter on behalf of NewCo or another
member of the HomeAdvisor Group. Any proceeds received by IAC or any other

Group shall be for the benefit of NewCo and such other members.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) This Agreement is not intended as an attempted assignment of any policy of
insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed to waive
any right or remedy of any member of the IAC Group in respect of any insurance
policy or any other contract or policy of insurance.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict any member of the
HomeAdvisor Group from acquiring at its own expense any other insurance policy
in respect of any Liabilities or covering any period.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6**

 



 

 **EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY**

 



 

Section 6.01 _Agreement for Exchange of Information; Archives_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any rights or obligations under any Other Ancillary
Agreement between the Parties and/or any other member of their respective
Groups relating to confidentiality, each Party agrees to provide, and to cause
its Representatives, its Group members and its respective Group members
Representatives to provide, to the other Group and any member thereof (a "
_Requesting Party_ "), at any time before, on or after the Contribution
Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section 6.04_ and as soon as
reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Information within
the possession or under the control of such Party or one of such Persons which
the Requesting Party reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting,
disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the Requesting Party
(including under applicable securities laws) by a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the Requesting Party, (ii) for use in any other
judicial, regulatory, administrative or other proceeding or in order to
satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or similar
requirements of the Requesting Party, in each case other than claims or
allegations that one Party to this Agreement or any of its Group members has
or brings against the other Party or any of its Group members, or (iii)
subject to the foregoing clause (ii) above, to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event that any Party determines that any such provision of
Information could be commercially detrimental, violate any Applicable Law or
agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege, the Parties shall take all
reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such obligations in a manner
that avoids any such harm or consequence.

 



 

(b) After the Contribution Effective Time, NewCo and the other members of the
HomeAdvisor Group shall have access during regular business hours (as in
effect from time to time), and upon reasonable advance notice, to the
documents and objects of historical significance that relate to the
HomeAdvisor Business, the HomeAdvisor Assets, NewCo or the HomeAdvisor
Entities and that are located in archives retained or maintained by IAC or any
other member of the IAC Group. NewCo and the other members of the HomeAdvisor
Group may obtain copies (but not originals) of documents for bona fide
business purposes and may obtain objects for exhibition purposes for
commercially reasonable periods of time if required for bona fide business
purposes, _provided_ that NewCo shall cause any such objects to be returned
promptly, at NewCos expense, in the same condition in which they were
delivered to NewCo or to any member of the HomeAdvisor Group and the other
members of the HomeAdvisor Group shall comply with any rules, procedures or
other requirements, and shall be subject to any restrictions. In any event,
the foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict the access of IAC or any other
member of the IAC Group to any such documents or objects. Nothing herein shall
be deemed to impose any Liability on IAC or any other member of the IAC Group
if documents or objects referred to in this _Section 6.01_ are not maintained
or preserved by IAC or any other member of the IAC Group. Alternatively, IAC,
acting reasonably, may request from NewCo and any other member of the
HomeAdvisor Group that they provide IAC with reasonable advance notice, with a
list of the requested Information that relates to the HomeAdvisor Business,
HomeAdvisor Assets, NewCo or the

 



      
 

 



 

HomeAdvisor Entities and IAC shall use, and shall cause the other members of
the IAC Group that are in possession of the Information requested to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to locate all requested Information that is
owned or possessed by IAC or any of its Group members or Representatives. IAC
will make available all such Information for inspection by NewCo or any other
relevant member of the HomeAdvisor Group during normal business hours at the
place of business reasonably designated by IAC. Subject to such
confidentiality or security obligations as IAC or the other relevant members
of its Group may reasonably deem necessary, NewCo and the other relevant
members of the HomeAdvisor Group may have all requested Information
duplicated. Alternatively, IAC or the other relevant members of the IAC Group
may choose to deliver to NewCo, at NewCos expense, all requested Information
in the form reasonably requested by NewCo or the HomeAdvisor Group. At IACs
request, NewCo shall cause such Information when no longer needed to be
returned to IAC at NewCos expense.

 



 

(c) NewCo shall make available and shall cause the HomeAdvisor Group to make
available to the IAC Group at least the level of access provided by the IAC
Group under _Section 6.01(b)_ to NewCo.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by either NewCo
or IAC (or any of their respective Group members) that is provided to a
Requesting Party pursuant to _Section 6.01_ shall be deemed to remain the
property of the providing party. Unless specifically set forth herein or in
any Other Ancillary Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such
Information.

 



 

Section 6.03 _Compensation for Providing Information_. The Party requesting
Information agrees to reimburse the providing Party for the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, if any, of creating, gathering and copying such Information, to
the extent that such costs are incurred for the benefit of the Requesting
Party. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, in the Other Ancillary Agreements, or in any other agreement
between the Parties, such costs shall be computed in accordance with the
providing Partys standard methodology and procedures.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Record Retention_. To facilitate the possible exchange of
Information pursuant to this _Article 6_ and other provisions of this
Agreement after the Contribution Effective Time, each of NewCo and IAC agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to retain, and to cause the members of
their respective Group to retain, all Information in their respective
possession or control at the Contribution Effective Time in accordance with
the policies of the IAC Group as in effect at the Contribution Effective Time
or such other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the appropriate Party
after the Contribution Effective Time. Prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Contribution Effective Time, neither NewCo nor IAC will destroy, or permit
any member of their respective Groups to destroy, any Information which the
other Party or any member of its Group may have the right to obtain pursuant
to this Agreement without first using commercially reasonable efforts to
notify such other Party of the proposed destruction and giving such other
Party the opportunity to take possession of such Information prior to such
destruction.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information_. The
rights and obligations granted or created under this _Article 6_ are subject
to any specific limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the
sharing, exchange, retention or confidential treatment of Information set
forth in any Other Ancillary Agreement.

requesting Party or any member of the Group to which such Requesting Party
belongs, upon written request, its then former and current Representatives
(and the former and current Representatives of its respective Group members)

such person (giving consideration to business demands of such Representatives)
or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in connection
with any Action in which the Requesting Party may from time to time be
involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect to which
indemnification may be sought hereunder. The Requesting Party shall bear all
costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) If either NewCo or IAC, being entitled to do so under this Agreement,
chooses to defend or to seek to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim,
the other Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to

and those of its respective Group members as witnesses and any books, records
or other documents within its control (or that of its respective Group
members) or which it (or its respective Group members) otherwise has the

settlement or compromise, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate in
such defense, settlement or compromise, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each of NewCo and IAC shall cooperate and
consult, and shall cause their respective Group members to cooperate and
consult, to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any Actions

respective Group against the other Party or another member of its respective
Group).

 



 

(d) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
_Section 6.06_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses inventors
and other employees without regard to whether the witness or the employer of
the witness could assert a possible business conflict (subject to the
limitation set forth in the first sentence of _Section 6.06(a)_ regarding
Third Party Claims).

 



 

(e) In connection with any matter contemplated by this _Section 6.06(e)_, the
relevant Parties will enter into, and shall cause all other relevant members
of their respective Groups to enter into, a mutually acceptable joint defense
agreement so as to maintain to the extent practicable any applicable attorney-
client privilege or work-product privileges of any member of any Group.

 



 

Section 6.07 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.08_, each of NewCo and IAC shall hold, and shall
cause its respective Group members, Affiliates (whether now an Affiliate or
hereafter becoming an Affiliate) and Representatives to hold, in strict
confidence, with at least a commercially reasonable degree of care, all
confidential and proprietary Information concerning the other Group (or any
member thereof) that is either in such companys possession (including
Information in its possession prior to the date hereof) or furnished by either
Group (or any member thereof) or by any of its respective Affiliates (whether

respective Affiliates and Representatives not to use, any such Confidential
Information other than for such purposes as shall be expressly permitted

by breach of any other agreement relating to confidentiality between or among
the relevant Parties and/or their respective Group members, their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) with respect to Confidential Information
regarding the IAC Group, lawfully acquired by a member of the HomeAdvisor
Group from a Third Party not bound by a confidentiality obligation and, with
respect to Confidential Information regarding the HomeAdvisor Group, lawfully
acquired by a member of the IAC Group from a Third Party not bound by a
confidentiality obligation, or (iii) with respect to Confidential Information
regarding the IAC Group, independently generated or developed by Persons who
do not and did not have access to, or descriptions of, any such confidential
or proprietary Information of IAC (or any member of the IAC Group) and, with
respect to Confidential Information regarding the HomeAdvisor Group,
independently generated or developed by Persons who do not and did not have
access to, or descriptions of, any such confidential or proprietary
Information of the HomeAdvisor Business (or any member of the HomeAdvisor

(b) Each of NewCo and IAC shall maintain, and shall cause its respective Group
members to maintain, policies and procedures, and develop such further
policies and procedures as will from time to time become necessary or
appropriate, to ensure compliance with _Section 6.07(a)_.

 



 

(c) Each of NewCo and IAC agrees not to release or disclose, or permit to be
released or disclosed, any Confidential Information to any other Person,
except its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information (who
shall be advised of their obligations hereunder with respect to such

limiting the foregoing, when any Information furnished by either NewCo or IAC
to the other Party after the Contribution Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement is no longer needed for the
purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement, the
Party to which such Information was furnished will promptly, after request of
the furnishing Party and at the election of the Party receiving such request,
destroy or return to the furnishing Party all such Information in a printed or
otherwise tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts
or summaries based thereon), and destroy all Information in an electronic or
otherwise intangible form and certify to the furnishing Party that it has
destroyed such Information (and such copies thereof and such notes, extracts
or summaries based thereon). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of NewCo and
IAC agrees that to the extent some Information to be destroyed or returned is
retained as data or records for the purpose of business continuity planning or
is otherwise not accessible in the Ordinary Course of Business, such data or
records shall be destroyed in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance,
if applicable, with the business continuity plan of the applicable Party.

 



 

Section 6.08 _Protective Arrangements_. In the event that any Party or any
member of its Group or any Affiliate of such Party or any of their respective
Representatives either determines that it is required to disclose any
Confidential Information (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") pursuant to Applicable
Law or receives any demand under lawful process or from any Governmental
Authority to disclose or provide Confidential Information of the other Party
(or any member of the Group to which such other Party belongs) (the "
_Providing Party_ "), the Disclosing Party shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, promptly notify the Providing Party prior to the Disclosing
Party disclosing or providing such Confidential Information and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Providing Party so that
the Providing Party may seek any reasonable protective arrangements or other
appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this _Section 6.08_. All
expenses reasonably incurred by the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective
order or other remedy will be borne by the Providing Party. Subject to the
foregoing, the Disclosing Party may thereafter disclose or provide such
Confidential Information to the extent (but only to the extent) required by
such Applicable Law (as so advised by legal counsel) or by lawful process or
by such Governmental Authority and shall promptly provide the Providing Party
with a copy of the Confidential Information so disclosed, in the same form and
format as disclosed, together with a list of all Persons to whom such
Confidential Information was disclosed.

members of the HomeAdvisor Group and their respective Representatives to hold,
in strict confidence the confidential and proprietary Information of Third
Parties to which it or any other member of the HomeAdvisor Group has access,
in accordance with the terms of any agreements entered into prior to the
Contribution Effective Time between one or more members of the IAC Group and
such Third Parties.

relate to, or arise under or in connection with this Agreement or any Other
Ancillary Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including all actions taken in furtherance of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby on or prior to the date hereof), or the commercial or
economic relationship of the Parties relating hereto or thereto, between or
among any member of the HomeAdvisor Group on the one hand and the IAC Group on

process of this _Section 7.02_ by giving the other Party with whom there is
such a controversy, claim or dispute written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
of any controversy, claim or dispute of whatever nature arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforceability or
validity thereof (a " _Dispute_ ") which has not been resolved in the normal
course of business. NewCo and IAC shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
Dispute by negotiation among their respective executives (" _Senior Party
Representatives_ ") who have authority to settle the Dispute and who are at a
higher level of management than the persons who have direct responsibility for
the administration of this Agreement. Within 30 days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, the receiving Party (the " _Responding Party_ " and, together
with the Claimant Party, the " _Dispute Parties_ ") shall submit to the other
Dispute Party a written response (the " _Response_ "). The Dispute Notice and
the Response shall include (i) a statement setting forth the position of the
Dispute Party giving such notice and a summary of arguments supporting such
position and (ii) the name and title of such Dispute Partys Senior Party
Representative and any other persons who will accompany the Senior Party

the Dispute. Within 30 days after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, the
Senior Party Representatives of NewCo and IAC shall meet at a mutually
acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem
necessary, to attempt to resolve the Dispute. NewCo and IAC shall cooperate in
good faith with respect to any reasonable requests for exchanges of
information regarding the Dispute or a Response thereto.

 



 

(b) If the Dispute has not been resolved within 60 days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, or if NewCo and IAC fail to meet within 30 days after delivery
of the Dispute Notice as

 



      
 

 



 

hereinabove provided, NewCo and IAC shall make a good faith attempt to settle
the Dispute by mediation pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 7.02_
before resorting to arbitration contemplated by this _Section 7.02_ or any
other dispute resolution procedure that may be agreed by NewCo and IAC.

 



 

(c) All negotiations, conferences and discussions pursuant to this _Section
7.02_ shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations. Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the
course of such negotiations, conferences and discussions that is not otherwise
independently discoverable shall be offered or received as evidence or used
for impeachment or for any other purpose in any current or future arbitration.

 



 

(d) Unless NewCo and IAC agree otherwise, the mediation shall be conducted in
accordance with the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution Model Procedure for
Mediation of Business Disputes in effect on the date of this Agreement by a
mediator selected by NewCo and IAC.

 



 

(e) Within 30 days after the mediator has been selected as provided above,
NewCo, IAC and their respective attorneys shall meet with the mediator for one
mediation session of at least four hours, it being agreed that each
representative of NewCo and IAC attending such mediation session shall be a
Senior Party Representative with authority to settle the Dispute. If the
Dispute cannot be settled at such mediation session or at any mutually agreed
continuation thereof, either NewCo or IAC may give the other and the mediator
a written notice declaring the mediation process at an end.

 



 

Section 7.03 _Arbitration_. If the Dispute has not been resolved by the
dispute resolution process described in _Section 7.02_, NewCo and IAC agree
that any such Dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before JAMS,
Inc. in Wilmington, Delaware pursuant to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration
Rules and Procedures. Any arbitrator(s) selected to resolve the Dispute shall
be bound exclusively by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
its choice of law rules. Any decisions of award of the arbitrator(s) will be
final and binding upon NewCo and IAC and may be entered as a judgment by the
Dispute Parties hereto. Any rights to appeal or review such award by any court
or tribunal are hereby waived to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.04 _Costs_. The costs of any mediation or arbitration pursuant to
this _Article 7_ shall be shared equally among the Dispute Parties.

 



 

Section 7.05 _Continuity of Service and Performance_. Unless otherwise agreed
in writing, the Dispute Parties will continue to provide service and honor all
other commitments under this Agreement and each Other Ancillary Agreement
during the course of dispute resolution pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article 7_ with respect to all matters not subject to such dispute,
controversy or claim.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by
any Party could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in
addition to any other right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled, at
law or in equity (including monetary damages) (but subject to _Section
2.15(c)_ and _Section 2.16(c)_), notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, such Party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking. The Parties agree that they will not contest the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

cause the other relevant members of the IAC Group to promptly, assign and

manner and on the terms consistent with the relevant provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, _Section 2.14(b)_. Similarly, to

applicable, in its capacity as direct and indirect parent company of the
members of the HomeAdvisor Group then owned by it, shall approve or ratify any
action of any member of the HomeAdvisor Group as may be necessary or desirable
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Other Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Contribution Effective Time, if either NewCo or IAC
identifies any commercial or other service that is needed to assure a smooth
and orderly transition of the businesses in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that is not otherwise governed by
the provisions of this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement, NewCo and
IAC will cooperate in determining whether there is a mutually acceptable arms
length basis on which such service can be provided.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.02 _Auditors and Audits; Annual and Quarterly Financial Statements

and public dissemination of IACs annual financial statements.

assessments and audit being referred to as the " _Internal Control Audit and
Management Assessments_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of IAC and NewCo will provide all required financial and other
Information with respect to their respective companies and their Subsidiaries
to their respective auditors in a sufficient and reasonable time and in
sufficient detail to permit their respective auditors to take all steps and
perform all reviews necessary to provide sufficient assistance to the IAC

the IAC Auditor is able to perform the procedures it considers necessary to

Auditors report on IACs financial statements, all within sufficient time to
enable IAC to meet its timetable for the printing, filing and public
dissemination of IACs annual financial statements;

necessary to conduct the Internal Control Audit and Management Assessments.

 



 

(d) _NewCo Reports._ NewCo will deliver to IAC a substantially final draft, as
soon as the same is prepared, of each report to be filed subsequent to the
Merger Effective Time with the SEC that includes NewCos audited year-end
financial statements or NewCos quarterly unaudited financial statements (the
" _NewCo Reports_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo may continue to
revise the NewCo Reports prior to the filing thereof, which changes will be
delivered to IAC as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the respective personnel of IAC and NewCo will actively consult with each
other regarding any changes which NewCo may consider making to the NewCo

 **ARTICLE 10**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 10.01 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any member of the

for any special, consequential, indirect, collateral, incidental or punitive
damages or lost profits or failure to realize expected savings or other
commercial or economic loss of any kind, however caused and on any theory of
liability (including negligence) arising in any way out of this Agreement,

understandings exist between NewCo and IAC other than those set forth or
referred to herein or therein. In the event of any inconsistency between this
Agreement and the Other Ancillary Agreements with respect to matters addressed
in the Other Ancillary Agreements, the provisions of the Other Ancillary
Agreements shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, the allocation of Taxes,
indemnification for Taxes, control of Tax proceedings, exchange of Tax

provision hereof or thereof;

 



 

(g) "including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including,
without limiting the generality of, any description preceding such term;

thereof).

 



 

Section 10.06 _Assignability_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in any Other Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement and
each Other Ancillary Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit

hereunder by such Subsidiary of IAC (in each case of clauses (i) and (ii)
effective prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of such

provided in any Other Ancillary Agreement:

 



 

(a) the provisions of this Agreement and each Other Ancillary Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective

Section 10.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any Other
Ancillary Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof or thereof, or the

 



      
 

 



 

application of such provision to Persons or circumstances or in jurisdictions
other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, as the case may be, is not
affected in any manner adverse to either party hereto or any party thereto.
Upon such determination, the relevant Parties shall negotiate in good faith in
an effort to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision to effect the

(a) No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so
waiving. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any
provision of this Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement shall not be
deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default, nor

Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

and every member of its Group), on the other hand, waives any conflict with
respect to such common representation that may arise before, at or after the
Contribution Effective Time.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by
a written instrument signed by the Parties which, unless the Merger Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms or the Merger Effective Time
shall have occurred, shall not become effective unless the Company has
provided its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) From the Contribution Effective Time and continuing until such time as
NewCo ceases to be a member of a "controlled group of corporations" (within
the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code) that includes IAC (such date, the "
_Plan Milestone Date_ "), NewCo adopts, and shall participate in as an
Adopting Employer (as defined in the IAC 401(k) Plan), the IAC 401(k) Plan for
the benefit of NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees, and IAC consents to
such adoption and maintenance, in accordance with the terms of the IAC 401(k)

Milestone Date, NewCo shall make timely direct contributions (including
matching contributions) to the IAC 401(k) Plan on behalf of such NewCo
participating employees in accordance with the terms of the IAC 401(k) Plan

the establishment of the NewCo 401(k) Plan and the NewCo 401(k) Plan Trust,
IAC shall cause the accounts of the NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees
in the IAC 401(k) Plan to be transferred to the NewCo 401(k) Plan and the
NewCo 401(k) Plan Trust in cash or such other assets as mutually agreed by IAC

responsible for all Liabilities under the NewCo 401(k) Plan to or relating to
NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees whose accounts are transferred from
the IAC 401(k) Plan. IAC and NewCo agree to cooperate in making all
appropriate filings and taking all reasonable actions required to implement
the provisions of this _Section 3.01_; _provided_ that NewCo acknowledges
that it will be responsible for complying with any requirements and applying

 **ARTICLE IV 
HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS**

 



 

4.01 _H andW Continuation Period_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Contribution Effective Time until the Plan Milestone
Date (such period, the " _H andW Continuation Period_"), IAC shall cause the IAC
Health and Welfare Plans in effect at the Contribution Effective Time to
provide coverage to HomeAdvisor Employees, Former HomeAdvisor Employees, and
any newly hired NewCo Employees (and, in each case, their beneficiaries and
dependents) on the same basis as immediately prior to the Contribution
Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of IACs Health and Welfare
Plans.

 



 

(b) From and after the Merger Effective Time, NewCo shall cause the Company to
provide coverage to Company Employees and Former Company Employees under the
Companys health and welfare plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time and until such time (the " _H andW Transition Date_") as
IAC causes those Company Employees and Former Company Employees who so qualify
to participate in IACs Health and Welfare Plans.

 



 

(c) Following the Contribution Effective Time, NewCo shall pay to IAC fees in
respect of IAC covering NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees under the
IAC Health and Welfare Plans, with such fees to be based on the per-employee
budgeted rates set forth in _Schedule I_ to this Agreement (as such schedule
may be updated by IAC in its sole discretion each calendar year to reflect the
updated rates applicable to IAC employees generally). The fees contemplated by
this _Section 4.01(c)_ shall be payable in advance each month ( _i.e._ , not
later than the first day of any month during which coverage applies) during
the HandW Continuation Period and shall be based on the prior months
enrollment, with appropriate, subsequent adjustments in each succeeding month
to reflect actual enrollment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees relating
to the period from and including the first day of the month during which the
Contribution Effective Time occurs through the end of the month during which
the Contribution Effective Time occurs shall be payable no later than the
fifth Business Day following the Contribution Effective Time. In the event
that NewCo fails to pay in a timely manner the fees contemplated by this
_Section 4.01(c)_, IAC shall have no obligation to provide the coverage
contemplated by this _Section 4.01_ to the applicable NewCo Employees and
Former NewCo Employees.

 



 

(d) Following the end of each calendar year (or portion thereof) during the
HandW Continuation Period, but not later than 150 days thereafter, IAC shall
calculate in good

 



      
 

 



 

faith the total costs and expenses of the IAC Health and Welfare Plans for
such calendar year (including claims paid and costs and expenses associated
with the administration of the IAC Health and Welfare Plans (as determined by
IAC in its good faith discretion) and IACs good faith estimate of claims
incurred in such calendar year but not reported (such estimate to be prepared
based on historical claims reporting patterns and history)) (the " _Annual H
andW Expenses_"), and IAC promptly shall provide to NewCo the Annual HandW
Expenses following such calculation. To the extent Annual HandW Expenses (i)
exceed the aggregate fees paid by IAC and NewCo in respect of coverage during
the applicable calendar year of IAC Employees and Former IAC Employees and
NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees (the " _Annual H andW Fees_"), NewCo
shall pay to IAC by wire transfer its ratable portion (calculated on the basis
of the number of NewCo Employees participating in the IAC Health and Welfare
Plans relative to the total number of IAC Employees and NewCo Employees taken
together and participating in such plans) of the fees deficit, and (ii) are
less than the Annual HandW Fees, IAC shall pay to NewCo its ratable portion
(calculated on the basis of the number of NewCo Employees participating in the
IAC Health and Welfare Plans relative to the total number of IAC Employees and
NewCo Employees taken together and participating in such plans) of the excess
fees collected, with any such payments pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii)
to be made no later than July 15 following the applicable calendar year. Any
calculations made by IAC pursuant to this _Section 4.01(d)_ shall be final
and binding upon NewCo and the calculations contemplated by this _Section
4.01(d)_ shall be adjusted to take into account any calendar year in which
participation by NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees in the IAC Health
and Welfare Plans is for less than the full calendar year.

 



 

4.02 _Establishment of NewCo Health and Welfare Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Plan Milestone Date, NewCo shall adopt Health and
Welfare Plans for the benefit of NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees,
and NewCo shall be responsible for all Liabilities relating to, arising out
of, or resulting from health and welfare coverage or claims incurred by or on
behalf of NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees or their covered
dependents under the NewCo Health and Welfare Plans on or after the Plan
Milestone Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.02_, with
respect to any NewCo Employee who becomes disabled under the terms of the IAC
Health and Welfare Plans and becomes entitled to receive long- or short-term
disability benefits prior to the Plan Milestone Date, such NewCo Employee
shall continue to receive long- or short-term disability benefits under the
IAC Health and Welfare Plans on and after the Plan Milestone Date in
accordance with the terms of the IAC Health and Welfare Plans.

 



 

4.03 _Retention of Sponsorship and Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Following the Contribution Effective Time, IAC shall retain:

 



 

(i) sponsorship of all IAC Health and Welfare Plans and any trust or other
funding arrangement established or maintained with respect to such plans,
including any assets held as of the Contribution Effective Time with respect
to such plans; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) all Liabilities under the IAC Health and Welfare Plans, subject to the
obligations of NewCo described in _Section 4.01_.

 



 

IAC shall not assume any Liability under any NewCo Health and Welfare Plan,

(b) Following the Contribution Effective Time, NewCo shall retain:

 



 

(i) sponsorship of all NewCo Health and Welfare Plans and any trust or other

(ii) all Liabilities under the NewCo Health and Welfare Plans.

 



 

4.04 _Flexible Benefit Plan_. IAC will continue to maintain on behalf of NewCo
Employees the health care reimbursement program, the transit and parking
reimbursement program, and the dependent care reimbursement program of the IAC
Flexible Benefit Plan for claims incurred prior to the Plan Milestone Date on
the same basis as immediately prior to the Contribution Effective Time and in
accordance with the terms of the IAC Flexible Benefit Plan. Following the
Contribution Effective Time and until such time as NewCo ceases to participate
in the IAC Flexible Benefit Plan and has satisfied all of its obligations
thereunder, NewCo shall pay to IAC the amounts claimed by NewCo Employees
under the IAC Flexible Benefit Plan in addition to NewCos share of the
administrative cost of the IAC Flexible Benefit Plan (based on IAC historical
allocations), with such amounts to be paid by NewCo on a one-month lagging
basis ( _i.e._ , claims made and administrative costs incurred during a
particular month shall be billed in the immediately succeeding month);
_provided_ that NewCo shall remit payment to IAC no later than the fifth
Business Day following delivery by IAC of an invoice to NewCo. NewCo Employees
shall not participate in the IAC Flexible Benefit Plan on or after the Plan
Milestone Date.

 



 

4.05 _Workers  Compensation Liabilities_. All workers compensation
Liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any claim by an IAC
Employee, Former IAC Employee, HomeAdvisor Employee, or Former HomeAdvisor
Employee that results from an accident occurring, or from an occupational
disease that becomes manifest, on or before the Contribution Effective Time
shall be retained by IAC; _provided_ , _however_ , that NewCo promptly shall
reimburse IAC for any such Liabilities relating to HomeAdvisor Employees or
Former HomeAdvisor Employees borne by IAC following the Contribution Effective
Time. All workers compensation Liabilities relating to, arising out of, or
resulting from any claim by an IAC Employee or Former IAC Employee that
results from an accident occurring, or from an occupational disease that
becomes manifest, on or after the Contribution Effective Time shall be
retained by IAC. All workers compensation Liabilities relating to, arising
out of, or resulting from any claim by (a) a Company Employee or Former
Company Employee, whether resulting from an accident occurring, or from an
occupational disease that becomes manifest prior to, on, or after the Merger
Effective Time, and (b) any other NewCo Employee or Former NewCo Employee that
results from an accident occurring, or from an occupational disease which
becomes manifest, on or after the Contribution Effective Time, in each case,
shall be retained by

 



      
 

 



 

NewCo. For purposes of this Agreement, a compensable injury shall be deemed to
be sustained upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to eligibility for
workers compensation benefits or at the time that an occupational disease
becomes manifest, as the case may be. IAC, NewCo, and the other NewCo Entities
shall cooperate with respect to any notification to appropriate governmental
agencies of the effective time and the issuance of new, or the transfer of
existing, workers compensation insurance policies and claims handling
contracts.

 



 

4.06 _Payroll Taxes and Reporting of Compensation_. IAC and NewCo shall, and
shall cause the other IAC Entities and the other NewCo Entities to,
respectively, take such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
in order to minimize Liabilities related to payroll taxes after the

appropriate governmental authorities of compensation earned by their
respective employees after the Contribution Effective Time.

(a) NewCo shall reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC RSUs or IAC Options held
by NewCo Employees or Former NewCo Employees that vest (in the case of IAC
RSUs) or are exercised (in the case of IAC Options) on or after the
Contribution Effective Time, with such cost equal to the taxable income that
arises from the applicable vesting or exercise event (the " _IAC Award Cost_
"). No later than five Business Days following invoice therefor, NewCo shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay to IAC the IAC Award Cost in, at IACs election, either cash or in shares
of NewCo Class B Common Stock having a value equal to the IAC Award Cost,
based on the closing price of NewCo Class A Common Stock on the applicable
vesting or exercise date; _provided_ , _however_ , that following such time as
IAC ceases to own shares representing a majority of the combined voting power
of the Outstanding NewCo Voting Securities, NewCo shall make such payment in
cash. NewCo shall be entitled to any compensation deduction corresponding to
the IAC Award Cost.

 



 

(b) The Compensation Committee of the IAC Board of Directors will have the
exclusive authority to determine the treatment of outstanding IAC equity
awards in the event of a Distribution and NewCo agrees to assume any equity
awards denominated in shares of IAC Common Stock that are converted into
equity awards denominated in shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock in
connection with any such Distribution.

 



 

5.07 _Subsidiary Equity Awards_. With respect to any stock-settled equity
awards granted pursuant to a Subsidiary Equity Plan (the " _Subsidiary Equity
Awards_ ") that are settled prior to such time as IAC ceases to own shares
representing a majority of the combined voting power of the Outstanding NewCo
Voting Securities, IAC may require those awards to be settled in either shares
of IAC Common Stock or in shares of NewCo Class A Common Stock. To the extent
that IAC elects to settle the Subsidiary Equity Awards in shares of IAC Common
Stock, NewCo will reimburse IAC in an amount equal to the taxable income that
arises from the settlement of the Subsidiary Equity Awards (the " _Subsidiary
Equity Award Cost_ ") by issuing to IAC additional shares of NewCo Class B
Common Stock having a value equal to the Subsidiary Equity Award Cost, based
on the closing price of NewCo Class A Common Stock on the date of settlement.
NewCo shall be entitled to any compensation deduction corresponding to the
Subsidiary Equity Award Cost.

such actions as are deemed necessary and appropriate to comply with its own
fiduciary responsibilities and shall fully release and indemnify the other
Party for any Liabilities caused by the failure to satisfy any such
responsibility.

the failure of such third party to consent, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to implement the provision in a mutually satisfactory manner. The
phrase "commercially reasonable efforts" as used herein shall not be construed

_Borrower_ "), hereby promises to pay to the order of [IAC/InterActive Corp.,
a Delaware corporation][Other IAC Lender Entity] (the " _Lender_ "), in lawful

alternative currency], the principal amount of this intercompany note (this "
_Note_ "), which amount the Borrower has borrowed from the Lender on or
following the date hereof pursuant to this Note, together with interest and
any additional principal and other amounts as provided herein.

 



 

1. _Principal_. [The Lender shall, pursuant to Section 5.16 of that certain agreement and plan of merger by and among [Aura], IAC/InterActiveCorp, Halo TopCo, Inc. (" _NewCo_ ") and Casa Merger Sub, Inc., dated as of May 1, 2017 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), on the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), advance amounts under this Note in United States Dollars required to pay off all amounts outstanding (including accrued and unpaid interest, related fees and expenses) under the Company Credit Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the " _Closing Date Advance_ ").] The Lender may, in its sole discretion, advance [further] amounts under this Note [in United States Dollars][Insert alternative currency] from time to time following a written request by the Borrower (each such advance and the Closing Date Advance, an " _Advance_ ", and the date of each Advance, an " _Advance Date_ "). The Lender shall endorse Schedule A hereto to reflect the date and amount of each Advance made under this Note, and the date and amount of any payment or prepayment of principal hereof; _provided_ that the failure of the Lender to make any such endorsement (or any error in such endorsement) shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder. Each such endorsement shall constitute _prima facie_ evidence of the accuracy of the information endorsed, in the absence of manifest error.

 



 

2. _Interest_. Interest in respect of any Advance shall accrue from the Advance Date with respect to such Advance on the unpaid principal balance of such Advance at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) the [Eurocurrency Rate][Insert applicable foreign currency benchmark rate] (as defined in that certain amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of October 7, 2015, among IAC/InterActiveCorp, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent, the issuing banks, the lenders and the other parties thereto, as further amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or refinanced or replaced from time to time (the " _IAC Credit Agreement_ ")) on the date of incurrence of such

      
 

 



 

Advance (using a three (3) month Interest Period (as defined in the IAC Credit
Agreement) unless the parties otherwise agree); _provided_ that if no IAC
Credit Agreement exists the Lender shall use the definition as if the IAC
Credit Agreement most recently in effect remained in effect plus (ii) 3.25%.

 



 

3. _Due Date_. The unpaid principal amount of this Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest, shall become due and payable in full in cash in the currency in which it was borrowed on [ ], 20[24] (the " _Maturity Date_ ").

 



 

4. _Prepayment_.

 



 

(a) _Voluntary_. At any time prior to the Maturity Date and with five (5)
days prior notice (unless the Lender agrees to a shorter notice period), the
Borrower may pay, without penalty or premium, the outstanding principal amount
of this Note in whole or in part, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

 



 

(b) _Mandatory_. If NewCo shall, or shall permit any of its subsidiaries to,
incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any indebtedness for
borrowed money or any guarantee of such indebtedness, other than indebtedness
owing under this Note, in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $25,000,000
(or if such indebtedness is denominated in any currency other than United
States Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount which, when converted into
United States Dollars at customary currency exchange rates in effect at the
time of such incurrence, would exceed $25,000,000), then, on the date of
receipt of the net cash proceeds of any such indebtedness by NewCo or any of
its subsidiaries, such net cash proceeds shall be used to pay, without premium
or penalty, the outstanding principal amount of this Note in whole, together
with accrued and unpaid interest. The Lender may decline such prepayment in
its sole discretion.

 



 

If a Change of Control shall occur, the Borrower shall pay on the date of such
Change of Control, without premium or penalty, the outstanding principal
amount of this Note in whole, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
Change of Control shall mean any of the following events:

 



 

i. the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of
all or substantially all of the assets of NewCo and its subsidiaries [or all
or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries],
taken as a whole, to any Person other than a Permitted Holder;

 



 

ii. the acquisition of beneficial ownership by any person or group (excluding
any one or more Permitted Holders or group Controlled by any one or more
Permitted

 



      
 

 



 

Holders) of more than 35% of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding
classes or series of NewCos Voting Stock and such aggregate voting power
exceeds the aggregate voting power of all outstanding classes or series of
NewCos Voting Stock beneficially owned by the Permitted Holders collectively;

 



 

iii. during any period of two (2) consecutive years, individuals who at the
beginning of such period constituted the board of directors of NewCo (together
with any new directors whose election by the board of directors or whose
nomination for election by the equityholders of NewCo was approved by a vote
of the majority of the directors of NewCo then still in office who were either
directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for
election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a
majority of NewCos board of directors then in office;

 



 

iv. [NewCo or] the Borrower shall adopt a plan of liquidation or dissolution
or any such plan shall be approved by the stockholders of [NewCo or ]the
Borrower[, as applicable];

 



 

v. any one or more Permitted Holders or group Controlled by any one or more
Permitted Holders ceases to hold at least 50% of the aggregate voting power of
all outstanding classes or series of NewCos Voting Stock; or

 



 

vi. if the Borrower is a subsidiary of NewCo, NewCo ceases to own 100% of the
Voting Stock of the Borrower, directly or indirectly.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction in which NewCo becomes a
subsidiary of another Person (other than a Person that is an individual or a
Permitted Holder) shall not constitute a Change of Control if the shareholders
of NewCo immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the same proportion of voting
power of the outstanding classes or series of NewCos voting stock as such
shareholders beneficially own immediately following the consummation of such
transaction.

 _Services; Payment; Independent Contractors_

 



 

3.01. _Services To Be Provided_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise agreed between the applicable Party providing Services
hereunder and the Receiving Party (including to the extent specified in the
applicable entry on the Services Schedule), (i) the Service Providers shall be
required to perform the Services only in a manner, scope, nature and quality
as provided by or within IAC that is similar in all material respects to the
manner in which such Services were performed in the twelve (12) months
immediately prior to the Effective Date (as defined in _Section 4.01_), and
(ii) the Services shall be used for substantially the same purposes and in
substantially the same manner as the Services have been used immediately prior
to the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable entry on
the Services Schedule shall control the scope of the Service to be performed
(to the extent provided therein), unless otherwise agreed in writing. Each
Party and the Service Providers shall act under this Services Agreement solely
as an independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of any other
Party or any of such Partys Affiliates. As an independent contractor, all
overhead and personnel necessary to the Services required of the Service
Providers hereunder shall be each Service Providers sole responsibility and
shall be at such Service Providers sole cost and expense. No Service Provider
shall have the authority to bind the Receiving Party by contract or otherwise.

 



 

(b) The provision of Services by the Service Providers shall be subject to
_Article V_ hereof.

hereunder will use good faith efforts to reasonably cooperate with each other
in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of Services. Such
cooperation shall include obtaining all consents, licenses

 



      
 

 



 

or approvals necessary to permit each such Party to perform its obligations to
such Receiving Party hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that under no
circumstances shall any Service Provider be required to make any payments to
any third party in respect of any such consents, licenses or approvals, nor
shall any Service Provider be required to make any alternative arrangements if
any such consents, licenses or approvals are not obtained.

 



 

3.03. _Additional Services_.

 



 

(a) From time to time during the term applicable to any Service being provided
by a Service Provider, each Party may request any of the other Parties (i) to
provide additional or different services that such other Party is not
expressly obligated to provide under this Services Agreement if such services
are of the type and scope provided by such providing Party within IAC or (ii)
expand the scope of any Service (such additional or expanded services, the "
_Additional Services_ "). The Party receiving such request shall consider such
request in good faith and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
such Additional Service; _provided_ that no Party shall be obligated to
provide any Additional Services if it does not, in its reasonable judgment,
have adequate resources to provide such Additional Services or if the
provision of such Additional Services would interfere with the operation of
its business. The Party receiving the request for Additional Services shall
notify the requesting Party within fifteen (15) days of receiving such a
request as to whether it will or will not provide the Additional Services.

 



 

(b) If a Party agrees to provide Additional Services pursuant to _Section
3.03(a)_, then a representative of each applicable Party shall, in good faith,
negotiate the terms of a supplement to the Services Schedule that will
describe in detail the service, project scope, term, price and payment terms
to be charged for the Additional Services. Once agreed in writing, the
supplement to the Services Schedule shall be deemed part of this Services
Agreement as of such date and the Additional Services shall be deemed
"Services" provided by such Service Provider to such Receiving Party
hereunder, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of this Services
Agreement.

 



 

3.04. _Subcontracting_. The Service Providers may hire or engage one (1) or
more subcontractors to perform any or all of its obligations under this
Services Agreement without the consent of the Receiving Party; _provided_ that
(a) the hiring or engagement of such subcontractor does not decrease in any
material respect the quality or level of services provided to the Receiving
Party below the standards set forth in _Section 3.01_, (b) the use of such
subcontractor will not increase the fees or costs payable by the Receiving
Party in connection with such Services, (c) the use of such subcontractors
will not change the manner in which the Services are delivered in a way that
increases the Receiving Partys costs of receiving the Services, and (d) the
Service Provider shall in all cases remain primarily responsible for all of
its obligations under this Services Agreement with respect to the scope of the
Services, the performance standard for Services set forth in _Section 3.01_
and the content of the Services provided to the Receiving Party.

 



 

3.05. _Payments_. Except as set forth on the Services Schedule, statements
will be delivered to each applicable Receiving Party within ten (10) Business
Days after the end of each month, and each such statement shall set forth a
brief description of such Services, the allocation of personnel costs related

the applicable providing Party and the Receiving Party may agree or as set
forth on the

 



      
 

 



 

Services Schedule, all undisputed amounts shall be due and payable by the
Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement. The
Receiving Party shall have the right to dispute any items set forth in an
invoice and the Parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any such
disputes pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section
7.02_. Statements not paid within such thirty (30)-day period shall be subject
to late charges on undisputed amounts only, calculated at an interest rate per
annum equal to the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%) (or the maximum legal
rate, whichever is lower), and calculated for the actual number of days
elapsed, accrued from the date on which such payment was due up to the date of
the actual receipt of payment. Payments shall be made by wire transfer to an
account designated in writing from time to time by the applicable Service
Provider, or as otherwise agreed by the Service Provider and the Receiving
Party.

 



 

3.06. _Increases in Costs_. The Parties understand and agree that the costs
set forth on the Services Schedule are based on the actual cost to the Service
Provider of the Services provided to the Receiving Party. If the actual cost
to the Service Provider of a Service increases, the Service Provider may, in
good faith, increase the cost for such Service with thirty (30) days prior
written notice.

 



 

3.07. _Disclaimer of Warranty_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SERVICES
AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THIS SERVICES AGREEMENT ARE
FURNISHED AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. If the provision of any Service for the account of a
Receiving Party by a Service Provider conflicts with such Service Providers
provision of such Service for its own account or the account of other
Receiving Parties, priority for the provision of such Service shall be
allocated in an equitable manner on an aggregate basis, and in a manner
consistent with the Receiving Partys level of use of such Service prior to
the Effective Date (or as described in the applicable entry on the Services
Schedule).

 



 

3.08. _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The amounts set forth on the Services Schedule with respect to each
Service do not include any sales, use, value-added, goods and services or
similar taxes (collectively, and together with any interest, penalties or
additions to tax imposed with respect thereto, " _Sales Taxes_ "). In addition
to the amounts required to be paid as set forth on the Services Schedule or
otherwise pursuant to this Services Agreement, the Receiving Party shall pay
and be responsible for, and if paid to a taxing authority by the Service
Provider shall promptly reimburse the Service Provider for, any Sales Taxes
imposed with respect to the provision of Services to the Receiving Party
hereunder or any payment of fees therefor; _provided_ that the Receiving Party
shall not be liable for any interest, penalties or other charges attributable
to the Service Providers improper filing relating to Sales Taxes or late
payment or failure to remit Sales Taxes to the relevant taxing authority;
_provided_ , _further,_ that the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to pay
such Sales Taxes if and to the extent that the Receiving Party has provided
the Service Provider with any valid exemption certificates or other applicable
valid documentation that would eliminate or reduce such Sales Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the Service Provider and the Receiving Party
shall each pay and be responsible for their own personal property taxes and
taxes based on their own income, receipts, capital, profits or assets.

 



 

(c) Payments for Services or any other amounts payable under this Services
Agreement shall be made without any deduction or withholding in respect of
taxes except to the extent such deduction or withholding is required under
applicable law. To the extent such deduction or withholding is so required
with respect to the making of any payment hereunder, the person making such
payment shall deduct or withhold amounts so required to be deducted or
withheld, and shall promptly remit any such deducted or withheld amounts to
the appropriate taxing authority, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Services Agreement as having been paid to
or on behalf of the payee.

 



 

3.09. _Use of Services_. Each Party, in its capacity as a Receiving Party
agrees with each applicable providing Party that it shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, resell any Services to any person whatsoever or permit

conduct of such Receiving Partys operations as conducted immediately prior to
the Effective Date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 _Term of Services_

 



 

4.01. _Term_. Subject to _Section 4.03_, the provision of Services hereunder
shall commence as of the Merger Effective Time (the time of commencement of
the provision of such Services being referred to as the " _Effective Date_ ")
and continue for one (1) year thereafter; _provided_ that this Services
Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional one (1) year periods
(each, an " _Extension Term_ ") for so long as IAC holds a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock of NewCo, unless all of the Services
provided hereunder have been terminated in accordance with this _Section
4.01_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the applicable entry on the
Services Schedule, any Service, or any portion thereof, may be cancelled or
reduced in amount by the Receiving Party or, in any Extension Term, by the
Service Provider, in each case upon ninety (90) days written notice thereof
or, if the Service Provider gives notice of an increase to the cost for such
Service pursuant to _Section 3.06_, thirty (30) days written notice (or, in
either case, such other notice period if one is set forth for such Service in
the applicable entry on the Services Schedule). The foregoing notwithstanding
and subject to _Section 7.01_, (i) a Service Provider may immediately
terminate any individual Service provided to a Receiving Party if the
Receiving Party fails to make payments for such Service under _Section 3.025_
and has not cured such failure within thirty (30) days written notice of such
failure from the applicable Service Provider, and (ii) upon ninety (90) days
written notice, the Service Provider may terminate any Service provided to a
Receiving Party at such time as the Service Provider no longer provides the
same Service to itself for its own account.

 



 

4.02. _Extension of Services_. If a Receiving Party requests an extension of
the term applicable to the provision of Services, such request shall be
considered in good faith by the applicable Service Provider. Any terms,
conditions, costs or fees to be paid by the Receiving Party for Services
provided during an extended term will be on terms mutually acceptable to

 



      
 

 



 

such Service Provider and the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt,
under no circumstances shall a Service Provider be required to extend the term
of provision of any Service if (i) the Service Provider does not, in its
reasonable judgment, have adequate resources to continue providing such
Services, (ii) the extension of the term would interfere with the operation of
the Service Providers business or (iii) the extension would require capital
expenditure on the part of the Service Provider or otherwise require the
Service Provider to renew or extend any Contract with any third party.

 



 

4.03. _Distribution_. If a distribution, however effected (including by way of
a reclassification or split-off), of NewCo stock to holders of IAC stock in a
transaction intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (a " _Distribution_ "), then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the provision of any Services hereunder that
are provided immediately prior to the Distribution shall continue from the
effective date of the Distribution until the first (1st) anniversary thereof,
unless such Service is earlier terminated in accordance with _Section 4.01_.
Each Party agrees with each other Party providing Services to it hereunder to
use its reasonable efforts following a Distribution to reduce or eliminate its
dependency on such Services as soon as is reasonably practicable; _provided_
that a breach of this sentence shall not affect a Service Providers
obligation to provide any Service through the term applicable to such Service.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 _Force Majeure_

 



 

5.01. The Service Providers shall not be liable for any expense, loss or
damage whatsoever arising out of any interruption of Service or delay or

territory, province or other political division thereof, changes in applicable
law, fires, hurricanes, floods, epidemics, riots, theft, quarantine
restrictions, freight embargoes or other similar causes beyond the reasonable
control of the Service Providers. In any such event, the applicable Service
Providers obligations hereunder shall be postponed for such time as its
performance is suspended or delayed on account thereof. Each Service Provider
will promptly notify the recipient of the Service, either orally or in
writing, upon learning of the occurrence of such event of force majeure. Upon
the cessation of the force majeure event, such Service Provider will use
commercially reasonable efforts, or cause any other relevant Service Provider,
to resume its performance with the least practicable delay ( _provided_ that,
at the election of the applicable Receiving Party, the applicable term for
such suspended Service shall be extended by the length of the force majeure
event).

otherwise, for any special, indirect, incidental or

 



      
 

 



 

consequential damages whatsoever (except, in each case, to the extent any
amount is paid to third parties by such Receiving Party or its Affiliates)

use of any Service provided under or covered by this Services Agreement,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability) or
otherwise, shall be limited to actions or omissions resulting from intentional
breach of this Services Agreement or gross negligence, and, in any event, such
liability shall not exceed the fees previously paid to such Service Provider
by such Receiving Party during the term of the applicable Service giving rise
thereto.

 



 

6.03. _Obligation to Re-perform_. If any breach of this Services Agreement by
any Service Provider resulting from any error or defect in the performance of
any Service (which breach such Service Provider can reasonably be expected to

Provider shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to correct in all
material respects such error, defect or breach or re-perform in all material
respects such Service upon receipt of the written request of the applicable
Receiving Party.

 



 

6.04. _Indemnity_. Except as otherwise provided in this Service Agreement
(including the limitation of liability provisions in this _Article VI_), each
Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other Party from and
against any Liability arising out of the intentional breach hereunder or gross
negligence of the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates, employees, agents, or
contractors (including with respect to the performance or nonperformance of
any Service hereunder). The procedures set forth in Sections 5.04 and 5.05 of
the Contribution Agreement shall apply to any claim for indemnification
hereunder.

_Section 2(a)(i)_; _provided_ , that if the inclusion of a NewCo Group member
in any Combined Return is inconsistent with past practice, Parent shall
provide notice to NewCo at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
any affected Tax Return. NewCo shall elect and join, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to elect and join, any Combined Returns that Parent
determines to file. Any Tax Return filed by Parent pursuant to _Section
2(a)(i)_ with respect to any Pre-Deconsolidation Taxable Period or any taxable
period that includes the Deconsolidation Date shall, to the extent relating to
NewCo or the NewCo Group, be prepared in good faith and in accordance with
applicable Law. NewCo shall, and shall cause each member of the NewCo Group
promptly (and in any event within 30 days following a request by Parent) to,
prepare and deliver to Parent, at NewCos expense, all information that Parent
may reasonably request, in such form as Parent may reasonably request to
prepare any Tax Return required to be filed by Parent pursuant to _Section
2(a)(i)_. Parent shall make any such Tax Return (including any amendment to
any such Tax Return) and related workpapers available for review by NewCo
sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such

 



       
 

 



 

Tax Return (or, in the case of an amended Tax Return, sufficiently in advance
of the filing of such amended Tax Return) to the extent such Tax Return
relates to Taxes for which NewCo is or would reasonably be expected to be
responsible or with respect to which NewCo would reasonably be expected to
have a claim. Parent and NewCo shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
issues arising out of the review of such Tax Return.

 



 

(ii) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or as a result
of a Final Determination, NewCo shall not (and shall not cause or permit any
members of the NewCo Group to) take any position on any NewCo Separate Return
(A) that is inconsistent with the past practices, accounting methods,
elections or conventions used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
preparing any Tax Return for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section
2(a)(i)_ (unless there is no substantial authority for such past practices,
methods, elections or conventions or there is no adverse effect on any member
of the Parent Group), or (B) that is inconsistent with this Agreement or, in
the event of a Distribution, any Tax Opinion or Tax Opinion Documents, any
Unqualified Tax Opinion, or any Private Letter Ruling Documents.

 



 

(c) _NewCo Tax Sharing Payments_.

 



 

(i) With respect to any Combined Return for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) that begins after the Merger Effective Date, NewCo shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the amount of estimated Taxes, if any, that would
be incurred by the NewCo Group and/or its members for such taxable period had
the NewCo Group and/or its members not been included in such Combined Return
(" _Estimated Tax Payments_ "). The Estimated Tax Payments owed by the NewCo
Group or any of its members for any such taxable period (or portion thereof)
shall be determined in accordance with the definition of NewCo Stand-Alone Tax
Liability.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any Combined Return for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) that begins after the Merger Effective Date, NewCo shall pay, or
shall cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(A) the NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability for such taxable period over (B) the
aggregate amount of Estimated Tax Payments made to Parent for such taxable
period. If the aggregate amount of Estimated Tax Payments made to Parent with
respect to such taxable period exceeds the NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability for
such taxable period, Parent shall pay to NewCo an amount equal to such excess.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any Combined Return for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) that begins after the Merger Effective Date, if the hypothetical Tax
Return that the members of the NewCo Group would have filed (but for their
inclusion in a Combined Return) would have reflected a net operating loss, net
capital loss, excess tax credit or other Tax Attribute (determined consistent
with the principles utilized in determining NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability)
required or permitted to be carried back by such NewCo Group members to a
prior taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Merger Effective
Date, Parent shall pay to NewCo an amount equal to the reduction in the NewCo
Stand-Alone Tax Liability for such prior taxable period (or portion thereof)
resulting from such carryback.

 



 

(iv) At least ten (10) days prior to the due date for any payment of Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) in respect of any Combined Return for any taxable
period (or

 



      
 

 



 

portion thereof) that begins after the Merger Effective Date, Parent shall
deliver to NewCo a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail Parents
calculation of the NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability, Estimated Tax Payments or
Refunds of Taxes, as applicable. No later than ten (10) days following the
delivery of such schedule, NewCo shall pay Parent (or Parent shall pay NewCo)
the amount shown as due on such schedule.

 



 

(v) If, as a result of a Final Determination with respect to any Combined
Return or the filing by Parent or by any member of the Parent Group of any
amended Combined Return, in each case, for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Merger Effective Date, there is an increase or
decrease in the NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability for such taxable period (or
any preceding or subsequent taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Merger Effective Date), the parties hereto shall promptly make
appropriate adjusting payments such that the aggregate amount paid by NewCo to
Parent for such taxable period (and any prior or subsequent taxable periods
(or portions thereof) affected by such Final Determination or amended Combined
Return) equals the redetermined NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability for such
taxable period or periods.

 



 

(vi) (A) At least ten (10) days prior to the due date for any payment of Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) in respect of any Combined Return for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Merger Effective Date,
Parent shall determine in good faith, consistent with the principles utilized
in determining NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability (disregarding the limitation to
taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Merger Effective
Date and including solely HomeAdvisor Entities in the NewCo Group), the
portion of any Tax liability reflected on the relevant Combined Return(s) for
such taxable period that is attributable to the HomeAdvisor Entities and shall
notify NewCo within ten (10) days of its determination in writing. No later
than ten (10) days following the delivery of such notice, NewCo shall pay
Parent the excess, if any, of the amount so notified over the amount of Tax
sharing payments previously made by such HomeAdvisor Entities to Parent in
respect of such taxable period (or Parent shall pay NewCo the excess, if any,
of the amount of Tax sharing payments previously made by such HomeAdvisor
Entities to Parent in respect of such taxable period over the amount so
notified).

 



 

(B) If, as a result of a Final Determination with respect to any Combined
Return or the filing by Parent or by any member of the Parent Group of any
amended Combined Return, in each case, for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) that ends on or before the Merger Effective Date, there is an
increase or decrease in a Tax Liability for such taxable period (or any
preceding or subsequent taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Merger Effective Date), Parent shall determine in good faith,
consistent with the principles utilized in determining NewCo Stand-Alone Tax
Liability (disregarding the limitation to taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Merger Effective Date and including solely
HomeAdvisor Entities in the NewCo Group), the portion of any such increase or
decrease attributable to the HomeAdvisor Entities and shall notify NewCo
within ten (10) days of its determination in writing. No later than ten (10)
days following the delivery of such notice, NewCo shall pay Parent the amount
of any such increase (or Parent shall pay NewCo the amount of any such
decrease).

 



      
 

 



 

 **3.** **_Responsibility for Taxes and Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) _Parent Liability_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 3(b)_,
Parent and the members of the Parent Group shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold harmless NewCo and its Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors and employees from and against (i) any Taxes
imposed with respect to any Combined Return (except to the extent that NewCo
is responsible for such Taxes pursuant to this Agreement (including any NewCo
Stand-Alone Tax Liability)) and any other Taxes imposed with respect to any
Tax Return for which any member of the Parent Group is responsible pursuant to
_Section 2(a)(ii)_, (ii) any Taxes resulting from any breach by Parent of any
representation or covenant in this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or
any Other Ancillary Agreement, and (iii) in the event of a Distribution, any
Tax-Related Losses for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section 4(c)_
of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _NewCo Liability_. NewCo and the members of the NewCo Group shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees from
and against (i) any Taxes imposed with respect to any Combined Return to the
extent that NewCo is responsible for such Taxes pursuant to this Agreement
(including any NewCo Stand-Alone Tax Liability) and any other Taxes imposed
with respect to any Tax Return for which any member of the NewCo Group is
responsible pursuant to _Section 2(a)(iii)_, (ii) any Taxes resulting from
any breach by NewCo of any representation or covenant in this Agreement, the
Contribution Agreement or any Other Ancillary Agreement, and (iii) in the
event of a Distribution, any Tax-Related Losses for which NewCo is responsible
pursuant to _Section 4(c)_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Tax Benefits_. If an indemnification obligation of Parent or any member
of the Parent Group under _Section 3(a)_ (or the adjustment giving rise to
such indemnification obligation) results in (i) increased deductions, losses,
or credits, or (ii) decreases in income, gains or recapture of Tax credits ("
_Tax Benefits_ ") to NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group, which would not,
but for the indemnification obligation (or the adjustment giving rise to such
indemnification obligation), be allowable, then NewCo shall pay Parent the
amount by which such Tax Benefit actually reduces, in cash, the amount of Tax
that NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group would have been required to pay
and bear (or increases, in cash, the amount of Refund to which NewCo or any
member of the NewCo Group would have been entitled) but for such
indemnification obligation (or adjustment giving rise to such indemnification
obligation). NewCo shall pay Parent for such Tax Benefit no later than ten
(10) days after such Tax Benefit is Actually Realized. If an indemnification
obligation of NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group under _Section 3(b)_ (or
the adjustment giving rise to such indemnification obligation) results in a
Tax Benefit to Parent or any member of the Parent Group, which would not, but
for the indemnification obligation (or the adjustment giving rise to such
indemnification obligation), be allowable, then Parent shall pay NewCo the
amount by which such Tax Benefit actually reduces, in cash, the amount of Tax
that Parent or any member of the Parent Group would have been required to pay
and bear (or increases, in cash, the amount of Tax refund to which Parent or
any member of the Parent Group would have been entitled) but for such
indemnification (or adjustment giving rise to such indemnification
obligation). Parent shall pay NewCo for such Tax Benefit no later than ten
(10) days after such Tax Benefit is Actually Realized.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Timing of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification payment required
to made pursuant to this _Section 3_ (other than a payment for any Tax
Benefit, the timing of which is provided in _Section 3(c)_) shall be made by
the Indemnifying Party promptly, but, in any event, no later than:

 



 

(i) in the case of an indemnification obligation with respect to any Tax
liabilities or Refunds, the later of (A) five (5) days after the Indemnified
Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing and (B) five (5) days prior
to the date the Indemnified Party is required to make a payment of Taxes to
the applicable Tax Authority (including a payment with respect to an
assessment of a Tax deficiency by any Taxing Jurisdiction or a payment made in
settlement of an asserted Tax deficiency) or Actually Realizes a reduced
Refund; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of any indemnification payment for any Losses not otherwise
described in _Section 3(d)(i)_ (including, but not limited to, any Losses
described in clause (b) or (c) of the definition of Tax-Related Losses,
attorneys fees and expenses and other indemnifiable Losses), the later of (A)
five (5) days after the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing and (B) five (5) days prior to the date the Indemnified Party is
required to make a payment thereof.

 



 

 **4.** **_Distribution-Related Matters_**.

 



 

(a) _Covenants_.

 



 

(i) NewCo agrees that, as long as a Distribution could, in the reasonable
discretion of Parent, be effected, (A) NewCo shall (and shall cause each
member of the NewCo Group to) take any action reasonably requested by Parent
in order to consummate a Distribution with Tax-Free Status, and (B) NewCo
shall not take or fail to take any action (and it shall cause the members of
the NewCo Group not to take or fail to take any action) which action or
failure to act could reasonably be expected to prevent Parent from
consummating a Distribution with Tax-Free Status; _provided_ that NewCo shall
not be required to make (or cause any Affiliate of NewCo to make) any
representation or covenant that is inconsistent with historical facts, as to
future matters or events over which it has no control, or which it otherwise
cannot make in good faith). NewCo agrees that, without Parents prior written
consent, it will not take (and will cause each member of the NewCo Group not
to take) any action that could reasonably be expected to (1) cause Parent to
cease to have "control" (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) of
NewCo or (2) result in a Deconsolidation Event, in each case, prior to the
Distribution Date.

 



 

(ii) In the event of a Distribution, neither Parent (or any member of the
Parent Group) nor NewCo (or any member of the NewCo Group) shall take or fail
to take any action, or permit or cause any member of the Parent Group or the
NewCo Group, respectively, to take or fail to take any action, if such action
or failure to act would be inconsistent with or cause to be untrue any
material information, covenant or representation in the Tax Opinion Documents
or Private Letter Ruling Documents; _provided_ , that Parent shall have
provided NewCo with a copy of any Tax Opinion and Tax Opinion Documents (or
portions thereof relating to the NewCo Group) or Private Letter Ruling and
Private Letter Ruling Documents (or portions thereof relating to the NewCo
Group), as applicable. In connection with obtaining any Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Opinion or Private Letter Ruling pursuant to _Section 4(a)_ hereof, Parent
shall consult with NewCo and consider in good faith any comments received from
NewCo, in each case, to the extent that such Tax Opinion Documents or Private
Letter Ruling Documents contain material information, covenants or
representations that would reasonably be expected to significantly affect
members of the NewCo Group.

 



 

(iii) In the event of a Distribution, from and after the Distribution Date,
NewCo shall not (A) take any action or permit any member of the NewCo Group to
take any action, and NewCo shall not fail to take any action or permit any
member of the NewCo Group to fail to take any action, in each case, unless
such action or failure to act could not reasonably be expected to (1) cause
the Distribution to fail to have Tax-Free Status or (2) require Parent or
NewCo to reflect a liability or reserve for Income Taxes with respect to the
Distribution in its financial statements, or (B) until the first day after the
Restriction Period, engage in any transaction that could result in the NewCo
Consolidated Group ceasing to be engaged in any NewCo Active Business for
purposes of Section 355(b)(2) of the Code. In the event of a Distribution,
from and after the Distribution Date, Parent shall not take any action or
permit any member of the Parent Group to take any action, that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Distribution to fail to have Tax-Free
Status.

 



 

(iv) In the event of a Distribution, from and after the Distribution Date
until the first day after the Restriction Period, NewCo shall not (A) enter
into any Proposed Acquisition Transaction or, to the extent NewCo has the
right to prohibit any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, permit any Proposed
Acquisition Transaction to occur (whether by (x) redeeming rights under a
shareholder rights plan, (y) finding a tender offer to be a "permitted offer"
under any such plan or otherwise causing any such plan to be inapplicable or
neutralized with respect to any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, or (z)
approving any Proposed Acquisition Transaction, whether for purposes of
Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar corporate statute, any "fair price" or
other provision of NewCos charter or bylaws or otherwise), (B) merge or
consolidate with any other Person or liquidate or partially liquidate, (C) in
a single transaction or series of transactions (1) sell or transfer (other
than sales or transfers of inventory in the ordinary course of business) all
or substantially all of the assets held by NewCo at the time of the
Distribution (2) sell or transfer 50% or more of the gross assets of a NewCo
Active Business or (3) sell or transfer 30% or more of the consolidated gross
assets of NewCo and its Subsidiaries (in each case, such percentages to be
measured based on fair market value as of the Distribution Date), (D) redeem
or otherwise repurchase (directly or through a Subsidiary) any NewCo stock, or
rights to acquire NewCo stock, except to the extent such repurchases satisfy
Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue Procedure 96-30 (as in effect prior to the
amendment by Revenue Procedure 2003-48), (E) amend its certificate of
incorporation (or other organizational documents), or take any other action,
whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise, affecting the voting rights
of NewCo stock (including, without limitation, through the conversion of one
class of NewCo stock into another class of NewCo stock), or (F) take any other
action or actions (including any action or transaction that would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with any representation or covenant made
in the Tax Opinion Documents or Private Letter Ruling Documents) which in the
aggregate (and taking into account any other transactions described in this
subparagraph (iv)) would be reasonably likely to have the effect of causing or
permitting one or more Persons to acquire, directly or indirectly, stock
representing a Fifty-Percent or Greater Interest in NewCo or otherwise
jeopardize the Tax-Free Status of the Distribution, unless, in

 



      
 

 



 

each case, prior to taking any such action set forth in the foregoing clauses
(A) through (F), NewCo shall have requested that Parent obtain a Private
Letter Ruling (or, if applicable, a supplemental Private Letter Ruling) from
the IRS and/or any other applicable Tax Authority in accordance with _Section
4(b)_ of this Agreement to the effect that such transaction will not affect
the Tax-Free Status of the Distribution and Parent shall have received such
Private Letter Ruling in form and substance satisfactory to Parent in its
reasonable discretion (and in determining whether a Private Letter Ruling is
satisfactory, Parent may consider, among other factors, the appropriateness of
any underlying assumptions and representations made in connection with such
Private Letter Ruling), or NewCo shall provide Parent with an Unqualified Tax
Opinion in form and substance satisfactory to Parent in its reasonable
discretion (and in determining whether an opinion is satisfactory, Parent may
consider, among other factors, the appropriateness of any underlying
assumptions and representations if used as a basis for the opinion), or Parent
shall have waived the requirement to obtain such Private Letter Ruling or
Unqualified Tax Opinion.

 



 

(b) _Procedures Regarding Opinions and Rulings_.

 



 

(i) If NewCo notifies Parent that it desires to take one of the actions
described in clauses (A) through (F) of _Section 4(a)(iv)_ (a " _Notified
Action_ "), Parent and NewCo shall reasonably cooperate to attempt to obtain
the Private Letter Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion referred to in _Section
4(a)(iv)_, unless Parent shall have waived the requirement to obtain such
Private Letter Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion.

 



 

(ii) At the reasonable request of NewCo pursuant to _Section 4(a)(iv)_,
Parent shall cooperate with NewCo and use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek to obtain, as expeditiously as possible, a Private Letter Ruling from the
IRS (and/or any other applicable Tax Authority, or if applicable, a
supplemental Private Letter Ruling) or an Unqualified Tax Opinion for the
purpose of permitting NewCo to take the Notified Action. Further, in no event
shall Parent be required to file any request for a Private Letter Ruling under
this _Section 4(b)_ unless NewCo represents that (A) it has reviewed the
request for such Private Letter Ruling, and (B) all information and
representations, if any, relating to any member of the NewCo Group, contained
in the related Private Letter Ruling Documents are (subject to any
qualifications therein) true, correct and complete. NewCo shall reimburse
Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Parent Group in
obtaining a Private Letter Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion requested by
NewCo within ten (10) days after receiving an invoice from Parent therefor.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall have the right to request a Private Letter Ruling from the
IRS (and/or any other applicable Tax Authority, or if applicable, a
supplemental Private Letter Ruling) or an Unqualified Tax Opinion at any time
in its sole and absolute discretion. If Parent determines to obtain a Private
Letter Ruling or an Unqualified Tax Opinion, NewCo shall (and shall cause each
Affiliate of NewCo to) cooperate with Parent and take any and all actions
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining the Private Letter
Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion (including, without limitation, by making
any representation or covenant or providing any materials or information
requested by the IRS or Tax Counsel; _provided_ that NewCo shall not be
required to make (or cause any Affiliate of NewCo to make) any representation
or covenant that is inconsistent with historical facts, as to future matters
or events over which it has no control, or which it otherwise cannot make in
good faith). Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

NewCo shall each bear its own costs and expenses in obtaining a Private Letter
Ruling or an Unqualified Tax Opinion requested by Parent.

 



 

(iv) NewCo hereby agrees that Parent shall have sole and exclusive control
over the process of obtaining any Private Letter Ruling, and that only Parent
shall apply for a Private Letter Ruling. In connection with obtaining a
Private Letter Ruling pursuant to _Section 4(b)_ hereof, (A) Parent shall
keep NewCo informed in a timely manner of all material actions taken or
proposed to be taken by Parent in connection therewith; (B) Parent shall (1)
reasonably in advance of the submission of any related Private Letter Ruling
Documents provide NewCo with a draft copy thereof, (2) reasonably consider
NewCos comments on such draft copy, and (3) provide NewCo with a final copy;
and (C) Parent shall provide NewCo with notice reasonably in advance of, and
NewCo shall have the right to attend, any formally scheduled meetings with the
IRS (subject to the approval of the IRS) that relate to such Private Letter
Ruling. Neither NewCo nor any member of the NewCo Group shall request any
guidance from the IRS or any other Tax Authority (whether written, verbal or
otherwise) at any time concerning the Distribution (including the impact of
any transaction on the Distribution).

 



 

(c) _Responsibility for Tax-Related Losses_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
_Section 4(c)(iii)_, in the event of a Distribution, NewCo shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees from
and against, one hundred percent (100%) of any Tax-Related Losses to the
extent attributable to or resulting from any one or more of the following: (A)
the acquisition after the Distribution of all or a portion of NewCos stock
and/or its or its Subsidiaries assets by any means whatsoever by any Person,
(B) any "agreement, understanding, arrangement, substantial negotiations or
discussions" (as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.355-7(h)) by any one or more officers or directors of any member of the
NewCo Group or by any other Person or Persons with the implicit or explicit
permission of one or more of such officers or directors (other than officers
or directors of Parent) that cause the Distribution to be treated as part of a
plan pursuant to which one or more Persons acquire, directly or indirectly,
NewCo stock representing a Fifty-Percent or Greater Interest therein, (C) any
action or failure to act by NewCo after the Distribution (including, without
limitation, any amendment to NewCos certificate of incorporation or other
organizational documents, whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise,
affecting the voting rights of NewCo stock (including, without limitation,
through the conversion of one class of NewCo stock into another class of NewCo
stock)), (D) the inaccuracy of any representation or covenant made by NewCo in
any Tax Opinion Documents or Private Letter Ruling Documents, or (E) any
breach by NewCo or any NewCo Affiliate of any covenant contained in _Section
4(a)_ (regardless of whether such act or failure to act is covered by a
Private Letter Ruling, Unqualified Tax Opinion or Parent waiver described in
_Section 4(a)(iv)_).

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
_Section 4(c)(iii)_, in the event of a Distribution, Parent shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless NewCo and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees from
and against, one hundred percent (100%) of any Tax-Related Losses (A) to the
extent attributable to or resulting from any one or more of the following:

 



      
 

 



 

(1) the acquisition after the Distribution of all or a portion of Parents
stock and/or its assets or the assets of a member of the Parent Group by any
means whatsoever by any Person, (2) any "agreement, understanding,
arrangement, substantial negotiations or discussions" (as such terms are
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(h)) by any one or more officers
or directors of any member of the Parent Group or by any other Person or
Persons with the implicit or explicit permission of one or more of such
officers or directors that cause the Distribution to be treated as part of a
plan pursuant to which one or more Persons acquire, directly or indirectly,
stock of Parent representing a Fifty-Percent or Greater Interest therein, or
(3) any breach by Parent or a member of the Parent Group of any covenant
contained in _Section 4(a)(ii)_ or (B) to the extent not otherwise covered by
_Sections 4(c)(i)_ , _(ii)(A)_ or _(iii)_ (including Tax-Related Losses
resulting from the incorrectness of any Tax Opinion or the revocation of any
Private Letter Ruling).

 



 

(iii) To the extent any Tax-Related Loss is subject to indemnification under
both _Sections 4(c)(i)_ and _(ii)(A)_ , responsibility for such Tax-Related
Loss shall be shared by Parent and NewCo according to relative fault,
_provided_ that:

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 4(c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary:

 



 

(1) with respect to (I) any Tax-Related Loss resulting from the application of
Section 355(e) of the Code and (II) any other Tax-Related Loss resulting, in
each case, in whole or in part, from an acquisition after the Distribution of
any stock or assets of NewCo (or any member of the NewCo Group) by any means
whatsoever by any Person or any action or failure to act by NewCo after the
Distribution affecting the voting rights of NewCo, NewCo shall be responsible
for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates and each
of their respective officers, directors and employees from and against, one
hundred percent (100%) of such Tax-Related Loss.

 



 

(2) if any Tax-Related Loss for which NewCo is responsible under this _Section
4(c)(iii)(A)_ results from an acquisition after the Distribution of (i) a
Fifty-Percent or Greater Interest in NewCo by any Person (or Persons treated
as one person pursuant to Section 355(e)(4)(C)(i)), or (ii) assets of the
NewCo Group having an aggregate fair market value of 50% or more of the fair
market value of all assets of the NewCo Group, the amount and timing of such
Tax-Related Loss shall, in each case, be calculated by assuming that Parent,
the Parent Consolidated Group and each member of the Parent Group (I) pays Tax
at the highest marginal corporate Tax rates in effect in each relevant taxable
period, and (II) has no Tax Attributes in any relevant taxable period.

 



 

(B) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 4(c)(i)_ or _(iii)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to (I) any Tax-
Related Loss resulting from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code
(other than as a result of an acquisition of a Fifty-Percent or Greater
Interest in NewCo) and (II) any other Tax-Related Loss resulting, in each
case, in whole or in part, from an acquisition after the Distribution of any
stock or assets of Parent (or any member of the Parent Group) by any means
whatsoever by any Person, Parent shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless NewCo and its Affiliates and

 



      
 

 



 

each of their respective officers, directors and employees from and against,
one hundred percent (100%) of such Tax-Related Loss.

 



 

(d) _Section 336(e) Election_. If Parent determines, in its sole discretion,
that a protective election under Section 336(e) of the Code (a " _Section
336(e) Election_") shall be made with respect to the Distribution, NewCo shall
(and shall cause the relevant members of the NewCo Group to) join with Parent
or the relevant members of the Parent Group in the making of such election and
shall take any action reasonably requested by Parent or that is otherwise
necessary to give effect to such election (including making any other related
election). If a Section 336(e) Election is made with respect to the
Distribution, then this Agreement shall be amended in such a manner as is
determined by Parent in good faith to take into account such Section 336(e)
Election (including by requiring that, in the event the Distribution fails to
have Tax-Free Status and Parent is not entitled to indemnification for the
Tax-Related Losses arising from such failure, NewCo shall pay over to Parent
any Tax Benefits realized by the NewCo Group arising from the step-up in Tax
basis resulting from the Section 336(e) Election).

 



 

 **5.** **_Refunds_**. Parent shall be entitled to all Refunds (and any
interest thereon received from the applicable Tax Authority) of Taxes for
which Parent is responsible pursuant to this Agreement. NewCo shall be
entitled to all Refunds (and any interest thereon received from the applicable
Tax Authority) of Taxes for which NewCo is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement. A party receiving a Refund to which another party is entitled
pursuant to this _Section 5_ shall pay the amount to which such other party
is entitled within ten (10) days after such Refund is Actually Realized. Each
of Parent and NewCo shall cooperate (and cause the members of their respective
Groups to cooperate) with the other party in connection with any claim for a
Refund in respect of a Tax for which any member of the Parent Group or the
NewCo Group, as the case may be, is responsible.

 



 

 **6.** **_Tax Contests_**.

 



 

(a) _Notification_. Each of Parent and NewCo shall notify the other party in
writing of any communication with respect to any pending or threatened
Proceeding in connection with a Tax liability (or any issue related thereto)
of Parent or any member of the Parent Group, or NewCo or any member of the
NewCo Group, respectively, for which a member of the NewCo Group or the Parent
Group, respectively, may be responsible pursuant to this Agreement within ten
(10) days of receipt; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Distribution-Related Proceeding (whether or not NewCo or Parent may be
responsible thereunder), such notice shall be provided no later than ten (10)
days after Parent or NewCo, as the case may be, first receives written notice
from the IRS or other Tax Authority of such Distribution-Related Proceeding.
Each of Parent and NewCo shall include with such notification a true, correct
and complete copy of any written communication, and an accurate and complete
written summary of any oral communication, received by Parent or a member of
the Parent Group, or NewCo or a member of the NewCo Group, respectively. The
failure of Parent or NewCo timely to forward such notification in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence shall not relieve NewCo or Parent,
respectively, of any obligation to pay such Tax liability or indemnify Parent
and the members of the Parent Group, or NewCo and the members of the NewCo
Group, respectively, and their respective Representatives, Affiliates,
successors and assigns therefor, except to the extent that the failure timely
to forward such notification

 



      
 

 



 

actually prejudices the ability of NewCo or Parent to contest such Tax
liability or increases the amount of such Tax liability (or reduces the amount
of a Tax Refund).

 



 

(b) _Representation with Respect to Tax Disputes_. Parent (or such member of
the Parent Group as Parent shall designate) shall, subject to _Section 6(d)_,
have the exclusive right to represent the interests of the members of the
Parent Group and the members of the NewCo Group and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense in any Proceeding relating to (i) any U.S. consolidated
federal income Tax Returns of the Parent Consolidated Group, (ii) any other
Combined Returns and (iii) any Parent Separate Returns; _provided_ , _however_
, that (x) Parent shall conduct any Proceeding relating to a Combined Return
in good faith and as if it were the sole party in interest and (y) to the
extent any such Proceeding could reasonably be expected to increase or
decrease any payments to or from NewCo under this Agreement by more than one
(1) million dollars, (A) Parent shall keep NewCo reasonably apprised regarding
the status of the Proceeding, (B) Parent shall provide NewCo with the
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence with any Tax
Authority and on any submissions to any court and (C) Parent shall not settle
or compromise such Proceeding without NewCos consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. NewCo (or such member of the
NewCo Group as NewCo shall designate) shall have the sole right to represent
the interests of the members of the NewCo Group and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense in any Proceeding relating to any NewCo Separate
Returns.

 



 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. Each member of the NewCo Group shall execute and
deliver to Parent (or such member of the Parent Group as Parent shall
designate) any power of attorney or other document requested by Parent (or
such designee) in connection with any Proceeding described in the first
sentence of _Section 6(b)_.

 



 

(d) _Distribution-Related Proceedings and Proceedings with Respect to Combined
Returns_.

 



 

(i) In the event of any Distribution-Related Proceeding or Proceeding relating
to a Combined Return that Parent has the right to control pursuant to _Section
6(b)_ and as a result of which NewCo could reasonably be expected to become
liable for any Tax or any Tax-Related Losses in excess of five (5) million
dollars, (A) Parent shall consult with NewCo reasonably in advance of taking
any significant action in connection with such Proceeding, (B) Parent shall
consult with NewCo and offer NewCo a reasonable opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Proceeding, (C) Parent shall defend such Proceeding diligently and in good
faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such
Proceeding, and (D) Parent shall provide NewCo copies of any written materials
relating to such Proceeding received from the relevant Tax Authority.
Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, the final
determination of the positions taken, including with respect to any settlement
or other disposition, in (1) any Distribution-Related Proceeding, or (2) any
other Proceeding relating to a Combined Return, which other Proceeding would
not reasonably be expected to result in a liability for additional Taxes for
which NewCo is responsible in an amount exceeding five (5) million dollars for
a single tax year, shall, subject to _Section 6(b)_, be made in the sole
discretion of Parent and shall be final and not subject to the dispute
resolution provisions of _Section 9_. With respect to any Proceeding relating
to a Combined Return (other than any Distribution-

 



       
 

 



 

Related Proceeding), which could reasonably be expected to result in liability
for additional Taxes for which NewCo is responsible in an amount in an amount
exceeding five (5) million dollars for a single tax year, NewCo shall be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding, and Parent shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Proceeding without obtaining the prior written
consent of NewCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(ii) In the event of any Distribution-Related Proceeding with respect to any
NewCo Separate Return, (A) NewCo shall consult with Parent reasonably in
advance of taking any significant action in connection with such Proceeding,
(B) NewCo shall consult with Parent and offer Parent a reasonable opportunity
to comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Proceeding, (C) NewCo shall defend such Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Proceeding, (D) Parent shall be entitled to participate
in such Proceeding and receive copies of any written materials relating to
such Proceeding received from the relevant Tax Authority, and (E) NewCo shall
not settle, compromise or abandon any such Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

 **7.** **_Apportionment of Tax Attributes upon Deconsolidation;
Carrybacks_**.

 



 

(a) _Apportionment of Tax Attributes upon Deconsolidation_. In the event of a
Deconsolidation Event:

 



 

(i) Parent shall determine in good faith and in accordance with applicable Law
the portion, if any, of any Tax Attribute of the Parent Consolidated Group or
any consolidated, combined or unitary state, local, or non-U.S. Income Tax, in
each case, arising in respect of a Combined Return to be apportioned to NewCo
or any member of the NewCo Consolidated Group and/or treated as a carryover to
the first Post-Deconsolidation Taxable Period of NewCo (or such member).

 



 

(ii) No Tax Attribute with respect to consolidated U.S. federal Income Tax of
the Parent Consolidated Group or any consolidated, combined or unitary state,
local, or non-U.S. Income Tax, in each case, arising in respect of a Combined
Return shall be apportioned to NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group, except
as Parent determines pursuant to _Section 7 (a)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall notify NewCo in writing of its determinations pursuant to
_Section 7(a)(i)_, and, if applicable, the amount of tax basis and earnings
and profits to be apportioned to NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group in
accordance with applicable Law, and shall provide written notice of such
determinations or calculations to NewCo as soon as practicable after the
information necessary becomes available to Parent.

 



 

(iv) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a Final
Determination, NewCo shall not take any position (whether on a Tax Return or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the information contained in the written
notice delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 7(a)(iii)_.

 



 

(b) _Carrybacks_. Except to the extent otherwise consented to by Parent or
prohibited by applicable Law, NewCo shall elect to relinquish, waive or
otherwise forgo all

 



      
 

 



 

Carrybacks. In the event that NewCo (or the appropriate member of the NewCo
Group) is prohibited by applicable Law to relinquish, waive or otherwise forgo
a Carryback (or Parent consents to a Carryback), (i) Parent shall cooperate
with NewCo, at NewCos expense, in seeking from the appropriate Tax Authority
such Refund as reasonably would result from such Carryback, and (ii) NewCo
shall be entitled to any Refund Actually Realized by a member of the Parent
Group (including any interest thereon received from such Tax Authority), to
the extent that such Refund is directly attributable to such Carryback, within
ten (10) days after such Refund is Actually Realized; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that NewCo shall indemnify and hold the members of the Parent Group harmless
from and against any and all collateral Tax consequences resulting from or
caused by any such Carryback, including (but not limited to) the loss or
postponement of any benefit from the use of Tax Attributes generated by a
member of the Parent Group or an Affiliate thereof if (x) such Tax Attributes
expire unutilized, but would have been utilized but for such Carryback, or (y)
the use of such Tax Attributes is postponed to a later taxable period than the
taxable period in which such Tax Attributes would have been utilized but for
such Carryback. If there is a Final Determination that results in any change
to or adjustment of a Refund Actually Realized by a member of the Parent Group
that is directly attributable to a Carryback, then Parent (or its designee)
shall make a payment to NewCo, or NewCo shall make a payment to Parent (or its
designee), as may be necessary to adjust the payments between NewCo and Parent
(or its designee) to reflect the payments that would have been made under this
_Section 7(b)_ had the adjusted amount of such Refund been taken into account
in computing payments under this _Section 7(b)_.

 



 

 **8.** **_Cooperation and Exchange of Information_**.

 



 

(a) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Each of Parent and NewCo, on
behalf of itself and each member of the Parent Group and the NewCo Group,
respectively, agrees to provide the other party (or its designee) with such
cooperation or information as such other party (or its designee) reasonably
shall request in connection with the determination of any payment or any
calculations described in this Agreement, the preparation or filing of any Tax
Return or claim for Refund, or the conduct of any Proceeding. Such cooperation
and information shall include, without limitation, upon reasonable notice (i)
promptly forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or other
communications (including, without limitation, information document requests,
revenue agents reports and similar reports, notices of proposed adjustments
and notices of deficiency) received from or sent to any Tax Authority or any
other administrative, judicial or governmental authority, (ii) providing
copies of all relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and
related workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
any Tax Authority, and such other records concerning the ownership and tax
basis of property, or other relevant information, (iii) the provision of such
additional information and explanations of documents and information provided
under this Agreement (including statements, certificates, forms, returns and
schedules delivered by either party) as shall be reasonably requested by
Parent (or its designee) or NewCo (or its designee), as the case may be, (iv)
the execution of any document that may be necessary or reasonably helpful in
connection with the filing of a Tax Return, a claim for a Refund, or in
connection with any Proceeding, including such waivers, consents or powers of
attorney as may be necessary for Parent or NewCo, as the case may be, to
exercise its rights under this Agreement, and (v) the use of Parents or
NewCos, as the case may be, reasonable efforts to obtain any documentation
from a governmental authority or a third party that may be necessary or
reasonably helpful in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any of the foregoing. It is expressly the intention of the
parties to this Agreement to take all actions that shall be necessary to
establish Parent as the sole agent for Tax purposes of each member of the
NewCo Group with respect to all Combined Returns. Upon reasonable notice, each
of Parent and NewCo shall make its, or shall cause the members of the Parent
Group or the NewCo Group, as applicable, to make their, employees and
facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation of
any documents or information provided hereunder. Any information obtained
under this _Section 8_ shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise
reasonably may be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for Refund or in conducting any Proceeding.

 



 

(b) _Retention of Records_. Each of Parent and NewCo agrees to (and to cause
the members of their respective Groups to) retain all Tax Returns, related
schedules and workpapers, and all material records and other documents as
required under Section 6001 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law)
existing on the date hereof or created in respect of (i) any taxable period
that ends on or before or includes the Distribution Date or (ii) any taxable
period that may be subject to a claim hereunder until the later of (A) the
expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions) for the
taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate and (B)
the Final Determination of any payments that may be required in respect of
such taxable periods under this Agreement. From and after the end of the
period described in the preceding sentence of this _Section 8(b)_, if a
member of the Parent Group or the NewCo Group wishes to dispose of any such
records and documents, then Parent or NewCo, as the case may be, shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party and shall provide the other party
the opportunity to take possession of any such records and documents within 90
days after such notice is delivered; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
other party does not, within such 90-day period, confirm its intention to take
possession of such records and documents, the relevant member of the Parent
Group or the NewCo Group, as the case may be, may destroy or otherwise dispose
of such records and documents.

 



 

(c) _Remedies_. Each of Parent and NewCo hereby acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the failure of any member of the Parent Group or the NewCo Group, as the
case may be, to comply with the provisions of this _Section 8_, may result in
substantial harm to the Parent Group or the NewCo Group, as the case may be,
including the inability to determine or appropriately substantiate a Tax
liability (or a position in respect thereof) for which the Parent Group (or a
member thereof) or the NewCo Group (or a member thereof), as applicable, would
be responsible under this Agreement or appropriately defend against an
adjustment thereto by a Tax Authority, (ii) the remedies available to the
Parent Group for the breach by a member of the NewCo Group of its obligations
under this _Section 8_ shall include (without limitation) the indemnification
by NewCo of the Parent Group for any Tax liabilities incurred or any Tax
Benefit lost or postponed by reason of such breach and the forfeiture by the
NewCo Group of any related rights to indemnification by Parent and (iii) the
remedies available to the NewCo Group for the breach by a member of the Parent
Group of its obligations under this _Section 8_ shall include (without
limitation) the indemnification by Parent of the NewCo Group for any Tax
liabilities incurred or any Tax Benefit lost or postponed by reason of such
breach and the forfeiture by the Parent Group of any related rights to
indemnification by NewCo.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Reliance by Parent_. If any member of the NewCo Group supplies
information to a member of the Parent Group in connection with a Tax liability
and an officer of a member of the Parent Group signs a statement or other
document under penalties of perjury in reliance upon the accuracy of such
information, then upon the written request of such member of the Parent Group
identifying the information being so relied upon, the chief financial officer
of NewCo (or his or her designee) shall certify in writing that to his
knowledge (based upon consultation with appropriate employees) the information
so supplied is accurate and complete. NewCo agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the Parent Group and its directors, officers and
employees from and against any fine, penalty, or other cost or expense of any
kind attributable to a member of the NewCo Group having supplied, pursuant to
this _Section 8_, a member of the Parent Group with inaccurate or incomplete
information in connection with a Tax liability.

 



 

(e) _Reliance by NewCo_. If any member of the Parent Group supplies
information to a member of the NewCo Group in connection with a Tax liability
and an officer of a member of the NewCo Group signs a statement or other
document under penalties of perjury in reliance upon the accuracy of such
information, then upon the written request of such member of the NewCo Group
identifying the information being so relied upon, the chief financial officer
of Parent (or his or her designee) shall certify in writing that to his
knowledge (based upon consultation with appropriate employees) the information
so supplied is accurate and complete. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the NewCo Group and its directors, officers and
employees from and against any fine, penalty, or other cost or expense of any
kind attributable to a member of the Parent Group having supplied, pursuant to
this _Section 8_, a member of the NewCo Group with inaccurate or incomplete
information in connection with a Tax liability.

 



 

 **9.** **_Resolution of Disputes_**. The provisions of Article 7 of the
Contribution Agreement (Dispute Resolution) shall apply to any dispute arising
in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of disputes arising under this Agreement, Parent and NewCo shall jointly
select the arbitrator, who shall be an attorney or accountant who is generally
recognized in the tax community as a qualified and competent tax practitioner
with experience in the tax area involved in the issue or issues to be
resolved.

 



 

 **10.** **_Payments_**.

 



 

(a) _Method of Payment_. All payments required by this Agreement shall be made
by (i) wire transfer to the appropriate bank account as may from time to time
be designated by the parties hereto for such purpose; _provided_ that, on the
date of such wire transfer, notice of the transfer is given to the recipient
thereof in accordance with _Section 12_, or (ii) any other method agreed to
by the parties hereto. All payments due under this Agreement shall be deemed
to be paid when available funds are actually received by the payee.

 



 

(b) _Interest_. Any payment required by this Agreement that is not made on or
before the date required hereunder shall bear interest, from and after such
date through the date of payment, at the Prime Rate.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Characterization of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law or pursuant to a Final Determination, the parties hereto agree
to treat, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat, (i) any payment
required by this Agreement or by the Contribution Agreement (other than
payments of interest), as either a contribution by Parent (or the relevant
member of the Parent Group) to NewCo or a distribution by NewCo to Parent (or
the relevant member of the Parent Group), as the case may be (which
contribution or distribution shall, in the case of any payment made following
the Distribution Date, be treated as occurring immediately prior to the
Distribution) and (ii) any payment of interest or non-U.S. federal Income
Taxes by or to a Tax Authority, as taxable or deductible, as the case may be,
to the party entitled under this Agreement to retain such payment or required
under this Agreement to make such payment; _provided_ in each case that if
such treatment is not permissible (or that an Indemnified Party nevertheless
suffers a Tax detriment as a result of such payment), the payment in question
shall be adjusted to place the payee in the same after-Tax position it would
have enjoyed absent such applicable Law or Final Determination.

 



 

 **11.** **_Treatment of Certain Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) _Deductions_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) any compensation
deductions arising in respect of equity awards (other than Specified
HomeAdvisor Awards) held by "NewCo Employees" or "Former NewCo Employees" (as
such terms are defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) (A) with respect to
which NewCo is required to reimburse Parent for "IAC Award Costs" or
"Subsidiary Equity Award Costs" (as such terms are defined in the Employee
Matters Agreement) or (B) that are denominated in or determined by reference
to the value of NewCo Class A Common Stock, NewCo Class B Common Stock or any
other class of NewCo common stock authorized from time to time shall be
allocated to the NewCo Group, (ii) any compensation deductions in respect of
Specified HomeAdvisor Awards that are vested as of immediately after the
Contribution Effective Time shall be allocated to the Parent Group, and (iii)
any compensation deductions in respect of Specified HomeAdvisor Awards that
are unvested as of immediately after the Contribution Effective Time shall be
allocated fifty percent (50%) to the NewCo Group and fifty percent (50%) to
the Parent Group.

 



 

(b) _Withholding and Reporting_. NewCo shall be responsible for Tax reporting
and withholding and the employer portion of any payroll Taxes in respect of
all equity awards held by NewCo Employees and Former NewCo Employees.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment Payments_. If, following a Deconsolidation Event, the NewCo
Group realizes a Tax Benefit in respect of a compensation deduction allocated
to the Parent Group under _Section 11(a)_, NewCo shall pay Parent the amount
by which such Tax Benefit actually reduces, in cash, the amount of Tax that
NewCo or any member of the NewCo Group would have been required to pay and
bear (or increases, in cash, the amount of Refund to which NewCo or any member
of the NewCo Group would have been entitled) but for such compensation
deduction. NewCo shall pay Parent for such Tax Benefit no later than ten (10)
days after such Tax Benefit is Actually Realized.

 



 

 **12.** **_Effective Date; Termination of Prior Intercompany Tax Allocation
Arrangements_**. This Agreement shall be effective as of the day after the
Merger Effective Date. As of such day, (i) all prior intercompany Tax
allocation agreements or arrangements solely

 



      
 

 



 

between or among members of the Parent Group, on the one hand, and members of
the NewCo Group, on the other hand, shall be terminated, and (ii) any amounts
due under such agreements with respect to taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or before the Merger Effective Date shall be settled as
promptly as practicable following the Merger Effective Date (and in any event
no later than the due date for filing any Combined Returns for such taxable
periods). Upon such termination and settlement, no further payments by or to
any member of the Parent Group or NewCo Group shall be made with respect to
such agreements, and all other rights and obligations pursuant to such
agreements shall cease at such time. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
of a Final Determination with respect to any Combined Return or the filing by
Parent or any member of the Parent Group of any amended Combined Return, in
each case following the termination of any such prior Tax allocation
agreements, any Tax sharing payments with respect to such Final Determination
or amended Combined Return shall be determined solely pursuant to _Section
2(c)(v)_ or _2(c)(vi)_ hereof.

 



 

 **13.** **_Assignability_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except as contemplated by paragraph (b) below, no Party
hereto may assign its respective rights or delegate its respective obligations
under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other
parties hereto.

 



 

(b) If Parent desires to effect a spin-off, split-off or similar transaction
(however effected) in which the equity interests of a Subsidiary of Parent
holding Parents interest in NewCo are distributed or otherwise transferred,
directly or indirectly, to the holders of one or more classes of Parents
capital stock, then, upon Parents written request, NewCo, Parent and such
Subsidiary of Parent shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to effect
(i) the assignment by Parent of its rights hereunder to such Subsidiary of
Parent and (ii) the acceptance of such rights and assumption of Parents
obligations hereunder by such Subsidiary of Parent (in each case of clauses
(i) and (ii) effective prior to or substantially concurrently with the
consummation of such transaction), and (iii) the acknowledgement by NewCo that
Parent shall thereafter have no liability hereunder (except for any liability
arising from any breach by Parent or relating to any actions or events
occurring, in each case, on or prior to the date of the spin-off, split-off or
similar transaction).

 



 

 **14.** **_Injunctions_**. The parties hereto acknowledge that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached. The parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court having jurisdiction,
such remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

 **15.** **_Miscellaneous_**. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10
(Miscellaneous) of the Contribution Agreement to the extent set forth therein.
