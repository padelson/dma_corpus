### The " _Purchase Price_ " shall be comprised of the Base Purchase Price
and Purchase Price Premium as defined in this Section 1.4:

  

### 

  

(a) _Calculation of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(i) _Base Purchase Price_. The " _Base Purchase Price_ " shall be comprised
of the Adjusted GAAP Equity calculated from the Final Closing Balance Sheet
(as defined in Section 1.5(c)(ii)). " _Adjusted GAAP Equity_ " is defined
as the GAAP Equity minus (1) any amounts attributable to goodwill and
other purchase related intangibles, net of any related inter-company balances
(which amounts shall be deemed settled as of the Effective Date), (2)
any net deferred tax asset, (3) any amount of net fixed assets, plus (4)
any net deferred tax liability.

  



  

(ii) _Purchase Price Premium_. $20 million premium paid in accordance with
Section 1.4(b)(iii) (the " _Purchase Price Premium_ ").

  



  

(b) _Payment of Purchase Price_. The components of Purchase Price shall be
paid as follows:

  



  

(i) _Initial Closing Payment_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay to
the Sellers the Adjusted GAAP Equity calculated from the 2004 GAAP Balance
Sheet (as defined in Article XI) minus the Closing Date BIPD Funding
Requirement (as defined in the BIPD Agreement) and minus any net adverse
development on the Loss Reserves (as defined in Section 7.1) since December
31, 2004, on Loss Reserves as of December 31, 2004, based upon actuarial
select in the latest quarterly Independent Actuarial Evaluation (as defined
in Section 7.2) available (the " _Initial Closing Payment_ ").

  



  

(ii) _Post Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post Closing Adjustment_ " is
calculated as the Adjusted GAAP Equity based on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet minus the Closing Date BIPD Funding Requirement (as defined in the BIPD
Agreement), minus the Initial Closing Payment, plus or minus any Final Audit
Adjustment (as defined in Section 1.5(b)). If the Post Closing Adjustment
produces a positive number, the Purchaser shall pay such Post Closing
Adjustment to the Sellers with interest from the Closing Date to the date of
payment of the Post Closing Adjustment at a rate of three percent (3%) per
annum, and if the Post Closing Adjustment produces a negative number, the
Sellers shall pay such Post Closing Adjustment to the Purchaser with interest
from the Closing Date to the date of payment of the Post Closing Adjustment
at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum. The payment of any Post Closing
Adjustment shall be paid within five business days of acceptance by
the parties of the Final Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in Section
1.5(c)(ii)) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

(iii) _Purchase Price Premium_. On the 120th day following the second
anniversary of the Effective Date and on each anniversary of such payment for
four years

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

thereafter, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller an amount of Purchase Price
Premium equal to $4 million. Such annual payments shall be adjusted by any
amounts due from the Sellers attributable to (1) the Reserve Guaranty (as
provided for in Article VII) or (2) the indemnification provisions in Section
9.2(e).

  



  

1.5 _Preparation and Delivery of Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) _Preparation of Draft Closing Balance Sheet_. The Purchaser shall
deliver to the Sellers as soon as practicable, and in no event later than 120
days after the Effective Date, a combined balance sheet of the Company Group
dated as of the Effective Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the application of GAAP in the 2004 GAAP Balance Sheet
(the " _Draft Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and a calculation of the Adjusted
GAAP Equity of the Company Group as of the Effective Date based on the Draft
Closing Balance Sheet. The Purchaser shall engage Tillinghast or another
actuarial firm of national reputation mutually agreed by the Purchaser and
the Sellers to conduct an Independent Actuarial Evaluation of the reserves of
Transguard for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance,
as at the Effective Date. The Draft Closing Balance Sheet shall reflect
reserves recorded based on the actuarial select estimate of unpaid losses and
loss adjustment expenses set forth in such Independent Actuarial Evaluation
as of the Effective Date. The Sellers shall cooperate with the Purchaser and
take such actions as may be necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by
the Purchaser in connection with the preparation of the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet, including making the Sellers advisors available for the purpose of
providing such information as the Purchaser may reasonably request in order
to prepare such financial statements.

  



  

### (b) _Post Closing Balance Sheet_. The Purchaser shall obtain an audit of
the balance sheet of the Company Group as of December 31 following the
Effective Date (the " _Post Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The audit of the Post
Closing Balance Sheet shall be completed and the audit report shall be
received by the Purchaser within 120 days of the date of the Post Closing
Balance Sheet. Any accounting errors discovered during the audit of the Post
Closing Balance Sheet that would have had an impact of more than $100,000,
either individually or in the aggregate, on the calculation of the Adjusted
GAAP Equity based on the Draft Closing Balance Sheet, if the item had been
properly reflected in the Draft Closing Balance Sheet, shall be considered a
" _Final Audit Adjustment_ " (such amount being the aggregation of all errors
discovered).

  

### 

  

### (c) _Notice of Disagreement_. Upon the Sellers request, the Purchaser
shall provide the Sellers with copies of workpapers and other documents
relating to its preparation of the Draft Closing Balance Sheet and the Post
Closing Balance Sheet. If the Sellers disagree with the Draft Closing Balance
Sheet or the Purchasers calculations of the Adjusted GAAP Equity or the
Final Audit Adjustment, the Sellers will give written notice of all such
disagreements (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Purchaser within 30
days after the Post Closing Balance Sheet is delivered to the Sellers.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Notice of Disagreement must set forth each item in disagreement,
provide reasonable specificity as to the basis for each disagreement, and
specify (to the extent practicable) the total adjustment to the Adjusted GAAP
Equity as calculated by the Purchaser as a result of such items in
disagreement.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### (ii) If the Sellers do not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to the
Purchaser within such 30 day period, the Adjusted GAAP Equity as calculated
by the Purchaser will be final and binding upon the parties, the Draft
Closing Balance Sheet will constitute the final combined balance sheet of the
Company Group as of the Effective Date (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_
"), and the Adjusted GAAP Equity and Final Audit Adjustment as calculated by
the Purchaser will constitute the final calculation of such amounts.

  

### 

  

### (iii) If the Sellers deliver a Notice of Disagreement to the Purchaser
within such 30 day period, the parties will negotiate in good faith to
resolve all disagreements as promptly as practicable. Any changes in the
Draft Closing Balance Sheet, Adjusted GAAP Equity, or Final Audit Adjustment
that are agreed to by the Purchaser and the Sellers will be incorporated into
the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the final calculations of the Adjusted
GAAP Equity and Final Audit Adjustment.

  

### 

  

### (iv) If the parties are unable to resolve all disagreements within 90
days after receipt by the Purchaser of the Notice of Disagreement, then all
unresolved disagreements will be resolved in accordance with Section 10.12.

as collateral for any payments made by Transguard under the NAVL Bond, a
clean, irrevocable, unconditional and evergreen letter of credit issued by a

## The Sellers and the Purchaser covenant and agree to make the election
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the sale of the Shares, and to take all necessary
and appropriate actions to effectuate the foregoing and to accurately report

and not by way of limitation, in order to effect such election, the Sellers
and the Purchaser shall jointly execute necessary copies of IRS Form 8023 and
all attachments reasonably determined by the parties to be required to be
filed therewith pursuant to the Code within the required time period. In
connection therewith, the Sellers and the Purchaser covenant and agree that
the Purchase Price allocation shall be determined within such period as
follows:

  

## 

  

(a) The Purchaser and the Sellers will cooperate with each other and jointly
allocate the Purchase Price and any post-closing adjustments thereto among
the assets of the Company Group. Such allocation shall be made in good faith
and in accordance with Section 338(h)(10) and related sections of the Code.
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall be bound by the allocation determined in
accordance with this Section and shall prepare and file all Tax Returns in
accordance with such allocation.

  



  

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser covenant and agree to report this
transaction for all domestic tax purposes in each and every respect in a
fashion consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to _Section
5.1(a)_. If the allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the
other party. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in
resolving such dispute and shall not settle such dispute or make filings or
other submissions with such Taxing Authority without

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

obtaining the other partys consent to the terms of such filings, submissions
or settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(c) Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser shall take any action, or cause or
permit Company Group to take any action, which could prohibit the making of a
valid Section 338(h)(10) election with respect to the transaction
contemplated herein.

  



  

5.2 _Tax Returns_.

  



  

The Sellers and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to:

  



  

(a) each provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return
required to be filed with respect to any member of the Company Group, or the
conduct of any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority or judicial
or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes of any member
of the Company Group and in making any claims for Tax refunds with respect
thereto, provided that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties;

  



  

(b) each retain and provide the other, any records or other information that
may be relevant to any such Tax Return, audit or examination, claim for
refund, proceeding or determination; and

  



  

(c) each provide the other with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding or determination that would reasonably be expected to
affect any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other for any
period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall (i) retain, until the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns of members
of the Company Group, supporting work schedules and other records or
information that may be relevant to such Tax Returns for all Tax periods or
portions thereof ending before or including the Effective Date and shall
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, and (ii) each allow the other and their
respective agents and representatives (and agents and representatives of
their respective Affiliates) to inspect, review and make copies of such
records as such party may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time
to time.

  



  

5.3 _Liability for Taxes_.

  



  

The Sellers are responsible for all Taxes payable by members of the Company
Group for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date and shall prepare
all Tax Returns with respect to members of the Company Group for all periods
ending on or before the Closing Date.  The Purchaser is responsible for all
Taxes payable by members of the Company Group for all periods commencing
after the Closing Date and shall prepare all Tax Returns with respect to
members of the Company Group for all periods ending after the Closing Date.
 If the Sellers determine, in their discretion, that it is
necessary, following the Closing Date, to amend any Tax Return previously
filed by any member of the Company Group with respect to any period ending on
or

  



  

23   

     
   

  



  

before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with such
amended Tax Return and the Purchaser shall cause the appropriate member (or
members) of the Company Group to execute and file such amended Tax Returns as
prepared by the Sellers. Any refunds, credits or overpayments of Taxes in
respect of Tax Returns with respect to members of the Company Group for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including but not limited to
any refund or credit allowable as an offset against Taxes otherwise payable),
plus any interest received with respect thereto from the applicable Taxing
Authorities, shall be for the account of the Sellers and if received by the
Purchaser and not included as an asset in the Final Closing Balance Sheet,
will be forwarded to the Sellers within ten (10) days of the Purchasers
receipt. Any refunds, credits or overpayments of Taxes with respect to
members of the Company Group for all periods commencing after the Closing

such agreements. No new elections with respect to Taxes or any changes in
current elections with respect to Taxes affecting the Company Group shall be
made after the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The Sellers and the Purchaser shall provide each other with prompt notice of
any Tax adjustment proposed in writing with respect to the assets
or activities of any member of the Company Group prior to the Closing
Date, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect any
right to indemnification hereunder unless the party not receiving notice is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Sellers shall control any such
proceeding, provided that the Purchaser or its representative shall have the
right, at its expense, to receive copies of all correspondence and documents
relating to such proceeding and to consult with the Sellers with regard to
the conduct of such proceeding.  The Purchaser shall, if reasonably requested
by the Sellers, cause the appropriate members of the Company Group to execute
all powers of attorney or other documents necessary to enable the Sellers to
exercise such control. The Sellers agree that they will not
settle, compromise or agree to any Tax adjustment that purports to be binding
on any member of the Company Group with respect to any period commencing
after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

5.6 _Transfer Taxes_.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all sales, use, transfer,
stamp, recording and similar Taxes, if any, required to be paid in connection

EMPLOYEES

  



  

6.1 _Employees_.

  



  

(a) The Company Group has no direct employees and its business is currently
conducted by the employees of the Sellers under a common paymaster
arrangement. The names, job titles, general job descriptions, salaries and
benefits of such employees (collectively, the " _Company Group Employees_ ")
shall be provided to the Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement.
On or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, select the Company
Group Employees for which it will offer continued employment.  Company Group
Employees selected by the Purchaser will be offered employment as of the
Closing Date under the Purchasers own terms and conditions in the event the
Closing Date is subsequent to December 31, 2005. In the event the Closing
Date is prior to December 31, 2005, and the Continuing Employees (as
defined herein) are leased pursuant to Section 6.1(b), such Continuing
Employees will be offered employment effective January 1, 2006, under the
Purchasers own terms and conditions. Those Company Group Employees who
accept the Purchasers offer of employment as of the Closing Date or January
1, 2006, as applicable, shall be referred to herein as the " _Continuing
Employees_."  Except as provided herein, (i) the Purchaser shall not be
liable to any Company Group Employee or the Sellers for termination pay,
severance pay, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, payment for
accrued vacation, sick or personal time, profit sharing or retirement
benefits, or any other benefits which such employee may be or become entitled
to as a result of being, or ceasing to be, a Company Group Employee, and (ii)
the Sellers shall assume full responsibility for any payments or liabilities
attributable to any benefit program offered to Company Group Employees by
them.

  



  

(b) In the event the Closing Date is prior to December 31, 2005, the Sellers
will lease to the Purchaser the Continuing Employees on terms and conditions
set forth in the Transitional Services and Service Bureau Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable Laws with respect to its
selection of Continuing Employees.

  



  

6.2 _No Obligation_.

  



  

While the Purchaser anticipates offering employment to a large portion of the
Company Group Employees, no provision of this Agreement (other than Section
6.7(b)) shall be construed:

  



  

(a) to require the Purchaser to hire any Company Group Employees;

  



  

(b) to require the Purchaser to provide any particular employee benefits to
any Company Group Employees employed by the Purchaser;

  



  

25   

     
   

  



  

(c) to require the Purchaser to recognize any years of service of such
employees for purposes of determining such employees rights or benefits
under any employee benefit plans of the Purchaser; or

  



  

(d) to prohibit the Purchaser from having the right to terminate the
employment of any such employee, with or without cause.

  



  

6.3 _Relocation Costs_.

  



  

To the extent the Purchaser offers employment to Company Group Employees at a
location of the Purchaser more than 50 miles from the current working
location of such employee, for a period of 120 days after the Closing Date
the Sellers shall be responsible for actual relocation costs up to the amount
of severance that would have been incurred by the Sellers if such employee
had not been employed by the Purchaser.

  



  

6.4 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

Except as provided in Section 6.7, the Sellers shall fully indemnify the
Purchaser and Company Group for any cost or liability attributable to any
employee benefit plan provided at any time by the Sellers or its Affiliates.

  



  

6.5 _401(k) Plan_.

  



  

With respect to the Sellers current 401(k) plan, the Sellers shall vest any
employer matching contribution for all Continuing Employees as of the Closing
Date. As of a date (the " _Account Transfer Date_ ") as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date or, if later, the date as of which Continuing
Employees become employees of the Purchaser, the Sellers shall cause to be
transferred from the current 401(k) plan sponsored by the Sellers (the "
_Sellers  401(k) Plan_") to a tax qualified section 401(k) plan sponsored by
the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser s 401(k) Plan_") cash or property reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser in an amount equal to the aggregate vested
account balances of all Continuing Employees who are participants in the
Sellers 401(k) Plan as of such Account Transfer Date (the " _Transferred
Assets_ "), except that all promissory notes reflecting participant loans to
Continuing Employees outstanding as of such Account Transfer Date shall be
transferred in kind.  As of the Account Transfer Date, the Purchaser shall
assume all liabilities applicable to Continuing Employees to the extent of
the Transferred Assets. In the event any Company Employee has a qualified
domestic relations order pending or approved in respect of any Continuing
Employee participating in the Sellers 401(k) Plan at the time of transfer,
all documentation concerning such qualified domestic relations order shall be
assigned to the Purchasers 401(k) Plan. The Sellers and the Purchaser agree
to cooperate fully with respect to any governmental filings, including but
not limited to the filing of any Internal Revenue Service Form 5310A
reporting obligations, information and procedures necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 6.5.  Pending the transfer of the
Transferred Assets, the accounts of the Continuing Employees shall remain in
the trust fund for the Sellers 401(k) Plan and the Sellers shall cause the
trustee of the Sellers 401(k) Plan to pay any current benefits or make any
distributions to Continuing Employees, including, without limitation, such
benefits as may be payable to Continuing Employees on account of termination
of employment

  



  

26   

      
  

  



  

with the Sellers, as they become due in accordance with the terms of the
Sellers 401(k) Plan. The Sellers and the Purchaser agree to provide each
other with such records and information as they may reasonably request
relating to their respective obligations under this Section 6.5, subject to
any confidentiality restrictions under applicable Laws.

  



  

6.6 _Continuing Disability Liability_.

  



  

If the Purchaser selects a Continuing Employee that is on disability leave as
of the Closing Date, the Continuing Employee shall remain covered under the
Sellers disability plan for purposes of payment of benefits for that period
of disability.

  



  

6.7 _Sellers  Severance Liability_.

  



  

(a) The Sellers will be responsible for any severance liability related to
any Continuing Employees terminated by the Purchaser within 120 days
following the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with the Sellers
severance benefit as reflected on _Schedule 6.7_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Sellers exposure for severance liability
under Sections 6.1 and 6.7 hereof and relocation costs in lieu of severance
benefits under Section 6.3 hereof exceed $300,000 (in the aggregate).  The
Purchaser will be responsible for all such severance and
relocation liabilities in excess of $300,000 (in the aggregate), if any.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser shall not terminate any more than 24 Continuing Employees
within the 90 day period following the date such Continuing Employees are
hired by the Purchaser. Likewise, the Purchaser shall offer employment to a
sufficient number of Company Group Employees upon such terms and conditions
as are necessary to avoid triggering notification and disclosure obligations
under the Worker Adjustment and Restraining Notification Act (WARN) or any
analogous State law. The Sellers shall not terminate any Company Group
Employees between the date hereof and the Closing Date except for cause or
other reasons unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _References to the Purchaser_.

  



  

References to the Purchaser in this Article VI shall mean the Purchaser, any
member of the Company Group or the Purchasers Affiliates.

  



  

# ARTICLE VII

  

# RESERVE GUARANTY

  

# 

  

7.1 _Guaranty of the Sellers_.

  



  

The Sellers fully and unconditionally guarantee (the " _Reserve Guaranty_ ")
the adequacy of the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense (the "
_Loss Reserves_ ") of Transguard and the collectability and admissibility of
related reinsurance up to an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price
Premium, for a period of six years from the Effective Date subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Such six year period will be
extended for 120 days if necessary in order to complete the Independent
Actuarial Evaluation (as defined below). The

  



  

27   

     
   

  



  

reserves for unallocated loss and loss adjustment expense contained in the
Independent Actuarial Evaluation (as defined below) shall be capped at
7.0% of the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense gross of
reinsurance as reflected in the respective Independent Actuarial Evaluation.
Further, if Sellers have met all collateral and funding requirements
contained in the BIPD Agreement, the Loss Reserves subject to this Article 7
will exclude any development on Loss Reserves related to the deductible
portion of the Transguard Policy (as defined in the BIPD Agreement).

  



  

7.2 _Adverse Reserve Development_.

  



  

If at any time during the six year period following the Effective Date the
Purchaser determines that Transguards Loss Reserves as of the Effective Date
were inadequate or related reinsurance is uncollectible or deemed statutorily
non-admissible (" _Adverse Reserve Development_ ") based upon the independent
actuarial evaluation performed by Tillinghast or some other independent,
qualified actuary mutually acceptable to the parties as of December 31 of
each year within such six year period (" _Independent Actuarial Evaluation_
"), such Adverse Reserve Development shall be subject to the provisions of
this Article VII.

  



  

7.3 _Reserve Development Cure_.

  



  

Within 120 days of the anniversary of the Closing, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Sellers a written notice of any reserve development in the
form attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto (" _Reserve Development Notice_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such reserve development,
including the Independent Actuarial Evaluation as of the most recent December
31. The Purchaser shall have the right to offset the amount of any Adverse
Reserve Development set forth in the Reserve Development Notice based upon
the Independent Actuarial Evaluation as of the most recent December
31, against any annual Purchase Price Premium payment pursuant to Section
1.4(b)(iii).

  



  

7.4 _Calculation of Reserve Development_.

  



  

Any calculation of reserve development shall be based on the change in:

  



  

(a) the select estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses
incurred, net of reinsurance, for all periods ending on or before the
Effective Date, based on the Independent Actuarial Evaluation of reserves for
loss and loss adjustment expense, net of reinsurance, as of the Effective
Date and recorded in the Final Closing Balance Sheet; and

  



  

(b) the select estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense
incurred, net of reinsurance, for all periods ending on or before the
Effective Date, based on the applicable Independent Actuarial Evaluation of
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense, net of reinsurance, as of the
applicable year end after the Effective Date through the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Date.

  



  

If the select estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense incurred,
net of reinsurance, for all periods ending on or before the Effective Date,
increases based on the

  



  

28   

     
   

  



  

applicable Independent Actuarial Evaluation prepared as of the applicable
year end after the Effective Date compared to an Independent Actuarial
Evaluation as of the Effective Date, such increase will be deemed Adverse
Reserve Development, as previously defined, and if the select estimate of
ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense incurred, net of reinsurance,
for all periods ending on or before the Effective Date, decreases based on
the applicable Independent Actuarial Evaluation prepared as of the applicable
year end after the Effective Date compared to the Independent Actuarial
Evaluation as of the Effective Date, such decrease will be deemed "
_Favorable Reserve Development_ ".

  



  

7.5 _Actuarial Analysis_.

  



  

The Purchaser shall furnish to the Sellers with any Reserve Development
Notice an Independent Actuarial Evaluation.

  



  

7.6 _Recoupment of Purchase Price Premium Payments_.

  



  

If at any time during the six year period following the Effective Date the
current Adverse Reserve Development exceeds the Purchase Price Premium
payment due during such year, such excess shall be paid by the Sellers up to
the amount of prior Purchase Price Premium payments. Any remaining excess
during such year shall be carried forward to future periods as a reduction to
future annual Purchase Price Premium payments.  To the extent a Purchase
Price Premium payment is not paid due to Adverse Reserve Development and
subsequently, within the six year period following the Effective Date, there
is Favorable Reserve Development, any prior Purchase Price Premium payment
that was reduced by Adverse Reserve Development shall be made to the extent
of the subsequent Favorable Reserve Development, not to exceed the amount of
such reduction.

  



  

To clarify, at the end of the six year period following the Effective Date
the total Purchase Premium payments shall be reduced by the cumulative
Adverse Reserve Development since the Effective Date and if there is no
cumulative Adverse Reserve Development since the Effective Date the total
Purchase Price Premium shall have been paid to the Sellers unless there is a
reduction to the Purchase Price Premium payment pursuant to Section 9.2(e). In
no event shall the Reserve Guaranty exceed $20 million.

  



  

To the extent that any amount of reinsurance adjustment attributable to
either uncollectibility or non-admissibility is included in the Reserve
Development Notice and any part of such amount is subsequently recovered, the
amount of recovery shall be credited to the Sellers if recovered within two
years of the end of the six year period to the extent of any prior reduction
to the Purchase Price Premium payment. However, any offsets to the Purchase
Price Premium payments (as defined herein) shall be reduced first by any
reserve development, second by any uncollectible reinsurance and lastly by
any non-admissible reinsurance. The Purchaser shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts in pursuing any related reinsurance recovery and, upon the
Sellers request after two years following the end of the six year period,
Transguard shall assign to the Sellers any reinsurance recoverable that (i)
was uncollectible or deemed non-admissible, (ii) was used as an offset to the
Purchase Price Premium, and (iii) was not

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

subsequently recovered from such reinsurer. Reimbursement of actual recoveries
as defined herein shall continue for two years beyond the six year period.

  



  

7.7 _Survival, Indemnification and Remedies_.

  



  

Survival, indemnification and remedies related to reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses are governed solely by this Article VII and not by
any other article in this Agreement.

of the Sellers or any Governmental Authority with respect to any
applicable statute of limitation in connection with any Tax Claim, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements relating to such Tax
Claim shall survive until such waiver is of no force or effect.

  



  

(b) As used in this Article IX, the following terms have the following
meanings:

  



  

(i) " _General Claim_ " means any claim arising out of or resulting from (1)
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Sellers contained in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents (other than
a Tax Claim or a claim made under Article VII), or (2) any matter set forth
on Schedule 2.8 or Schedule 2.9 to the extent the Loss related to such claim
exceeds the amount reflected or reserved therefor in the Final Closing
Balance Sheet.

  



  

(ii) " _Tax Claim_ " means any claim based upon, arising out of or otherwise
in respect of:

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

(A) any Taxes of any member of the Company Group, the Sellers or the Sellers
Affiliates with respect to any period ending on or before the Closing Date;
or

  



  

(B) any inaccuracy in or any breach of any Tax-related representation or
warranty of the Sellers contained in this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or any liability of any member of the Company Group, the Sellers or
the Sellers Affiliates for Taxes for any period in which any member of the
Company Group may be held liable as an Affiliate of any of the Sellers
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6.

  



  

9.2 _Obligation of the Sellers to Indemnify_.

  



  

The Sellers agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and
its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives and permitted
assigns (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Losses arising
out of or resulting from:

  



  

(a) Any General Claim.

  



  

(b) Any Tax Claim.

  



  

(c) The Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against any Losses until the Purchaser Indemnitees have
suffered Losses in the aggregate in excess of $500,000 (the "
_Indemnification Threshold_ ") and then only to the extent of such excess.
The Indemnification Threshold shall not apply to indemnification for Losses
related to any Tax Claim or any claim under Article VII, Section 2.15 or
any other section of this Agreement specifically limiting its applicability.

  



  

(d) The Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against any Loss that individually is less than $5,000
and each such Loss will be taken into account in determining whether the
aggregate amount of Losses exceeds the Indemnification Threshold.

  



  

(e) The Sellers obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees from and
against any Losses related to any General Claim shall be limited to
$50,000,000 (the " _General Indemnity Cap_ "); provided, however, that if
such Loss equals or exceeds $60,000,000, then the Purchaser shall be entitled
to setoff an amount in respect of Losses determined as indemnifiable in
accordance with Article IX or as the parties agree is indemnifiable in
accordance with this Article IX in excess of $60,000,000 against any Purchase
Price Premium payment.

  



  

9.3 _Obligation of the Purchaser to Indemnify_.

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or in the Transaction Documents.

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

9.4 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Notice of Third Party Claim_. Promptly after receipt by the Purchaser
or the Sellers from a third party of notice of any demand, claim or
circumstances that, with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the
commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or
investigation that may result in a Loss for which indemnification is or may
be available under this Article IX (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
indemnified party shall give notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the
other party. The Claims Notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the indemnified party.

  



  

(b) _Opportunity to Defend_. The indemnifying party may elect to compromise
or defend and control the defense of, at its own expense and by counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, any Third Party Claim,
provided that the indemnified party shall have no liability under
any compromise or settlement agreed to by the indemnifying party that
indemnified party has not approved in writing, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim, it shall within 30 days of receipt of the
Claims Notice (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires)
notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so, and the indemnified
party shall cooperate upon the request and at the expense of the indemnifying
party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim. If
the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Third Party
Claim, or fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein
provided, the indemnified party may pay or defend such Third Party Claim in
any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate; provided, that in no event
will an indemnified party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).  In any event, the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
may, at their own expense, participate in, but not control, the defense of
such Third Party Claim by the other party. If the indemnifying party chooses
to defend any claim, the indemnified party shall make available to the
indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control
that are reasonably requested for such defense and shall otherwise cooperate
with the indemnifying party, in which event the indemnified party shall be
reimbursed for its out-of-pocket expenses (which shall not include salary,
wages, overhead and the like).

  



  

(c) _No Application to Tax Claims_. The provisions of this Section 9.4
shall not apply with respect to Tax Claims attributable to Tax proceedings
described in Section 5.5, the terms of which shall govern the conduct of all
such proceedings.

  



  

9.5 _Remedies_.

  



  

Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of indemnification
contained in this Article, and in addition to them, the parties shall have,
without limitation, the right to seek specific performance of this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or any portion hereof or thereof.

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

9.6 _Mitigation_.

  



  

In the event that any party suffers any Loss for which it has or makes a
valid claim against another party for indemnification, it must
take reasonable steps to mitigate its Loss.

  



  

9.7 _Determination of Losses_.

  



  

With respect to any right to indemnify of either party under this Article IX:

  



  

(a) In determining losses for the purposes of a General Claim, no
consideration or adjustment shall be made for taxes or tax benefits
attributable to such losses.

  



  

(b) The amount of any Losses incurred by the indemnified party shall be
reduced by the net amount the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates
recovers (after deducting all reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and other
costs of recovery) from any insurer or other party liable for such Losses,
and the indemnified party shall use reasonable efforts to effect any such
recovery.

  



  

(c) To the extent provided by applicable law, indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the Purchaser and the Sellers
and their Affiliates as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all relevant
tax purposes.

  



  

9.8 _Limitation on Damages_.

  



  

The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that neither party will
seek recovery for punitive or consequential damages pursuant to this Article
IX, other than indemnification for any such damages paid to another party
with respect to a Third Party Claim.

  



  

9.9 _Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses_.

  



  

Survival, indemnification and remedies related to Article VII (Reserve
Guaranty) shall be exclusively governed by Article VII of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article VII of this Agreement set
forth the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser with respect to the
adequacy or sufficiency of, or the calculation methodology relating to, the
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense of Transguard; provided,
however, that the Funding Requirement and other obligations set forth in the
BIPD Agreement constitute separate and distinct obligations of the Sellers to
Transguard.

  



  

9.10 _Exclusivity of Indemnification Provision_.

  



  

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the indemnity provided for
in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnitees after the Closing for any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Sellers or any failure or breach of any covenant, obligation,
condition or agreement to be performed or fulfilled by the Sellers, excluding
those contained in Article VII.

## 

  

The parties agree that this transaction is an arms length transaction in
which the parties undertakings and obligations are limited to the

#### 

  

#### (ii) by the Purchaser or the Sellers if the Closing has not taken place
on or before March 31, 2006, or such later date as the parties may have
agreed to in writing, provided that the non-occurrence of the Closing is not
attributable to a breach of the terms of this Agreement by the party seeking
termination, and provided that this Agreement may be extended by written
notice of either the Sellers or the Purchaser to a date not later than April
30, 2006, if the non-occurrence of the Closing is a direct result of the
conditions contained in Section 8.1 (a)-(e) not having been satisfied by
such date.

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

(iii) by the Purchaser, if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, the
Sellers have been unable to obtain, on or before October 3, 2005,
approvals, waivers or releases, to the extent required, from the lenders

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

Interests and any guarantees by any member of the Company Group related

this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.  The Credit Agreement Waiver
shall be continuously effective from the date received through the Closing
Date.

whether obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement; and

Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

10.4, this Agreement will become null and void and of no further force or
effect, except for Section 4.4 (relating to public announcements) and Section
10.5 (relating to expenses). Nothing in this Section 10.4 will be deemed to
release either party from any liability for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of either party
to compel specific performance by the other party of its obligations under
this Agreement.

  



  

## 10.5 _Expenses_.
