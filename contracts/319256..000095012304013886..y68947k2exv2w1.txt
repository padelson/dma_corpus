3.1(b)     ix   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of November 16,
2004 (this "Agreement") is by and between Kmart Holding Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Kmart"), and Sears, Roebuck and Co., a New York
corporation ("Sears").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Kmart and
Sears have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders to consummate, their respective Mergers (as defined
in Section 1.6(b)) in which the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of Kmart and Sears will be converted into the right to receive
shares of capital stock of Holdco (as defined in Section 1.1);   WHEREAS,
the Boards of Directors of Kmart and Sears have each determined that their
respective Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies
and goals;   WHEREAS, Kmart and Sears desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Mergers and also to prescribe various conditions to the Mergers;   WHEREAS,
for Federal income tax purposes, (i) it is intended that the exchange of
Sears Common Stock and Kmart Common Stock for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to
the Mergers, taken together, shall qualify as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");
(ii) it is intended that the Kmart Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (iii) the parties
intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); and   WHEREAS, as a
condition and inducement to each of Kmart\'s and Sears\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Kmart, Sears and certain affiliates of ESL
Investments, Inc. (collectively, "ESL") are entering into a Support
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
"Support Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, ESL has
agreed to vote all shares of Kmart Common Stock and Sears Common Stock
beneficially owned by ESL in favor of adoption of this Agreement, to make a
Stock Election (as defined herein) with respect to all shares of Sears Common
Stock beneficially owned by ESL and not to sell or otherwise transfer any
shares of Kmart Common Stock or Sears Common Stock prior to the termination
of such Support Agreement in accordance with its terms;   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1. Organization of Holdco. As
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Kmart
shall organize a new corporation ("Holdco") under the laws of the State of
Delaware for the sole purpose of effectuating the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of Holdco shall initially be as agreed upon by Kmart and Sears. The
authorized capital stock of Holdco shall initially  consist of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Holdco Common Stock"), of which
only one share shall be issued to Kmart. Kmart shall take, and shall cause
Holdco to take, all requisite action to cause the Certificate of
Incorporation of Holdco to be in the form of Exhibit 1.1(a) hereto and the
By-laws of Holdco to be in the form of Exhibit 1.1(b) hereto immediately
following the Effective Time.   1.2. Directors and Officers of Holdco. Prior
to the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Holdco shall consist of
the directors and officers as set forth on Exhibit 1.2. Kmart shall take all
requisite action to cause the directors and officers of Holdco as of the
Effective Time to be as provided in Section 5.10.   1.3. Organization of
Merger Subs. As promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Kmart shall cause Holdco to organize for the sole purpose of
effectuating the Mergers:   (a) a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of New York ("Sears Merger Sub"); the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of Sears Merger Sub shall be in such forms as shall be determined
by Holdco, Kmart and Sears as soon as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement; and the authorized capital stock of Sears Merger Sub shall
initially consist of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which shares shall be issued to Holdco at a price of $1.00 per share;
and   (b) a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
("Kmart Merger Sub" and, together with Sears Merger Sub, the "Merger Subs");
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Kmart Merger Sub shall be in
such forms as shall be determined by Holdco, Kmart and Sears as soon
as practicable following the execution of this Agreement; and the
authorized capital stock of Kmart Merger Sub shall initially consist of 100
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which shares shall
be issued to Holdco at a price of $1.00 per share.   1.4. Actions of
Directors and Officers. As promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, Kmart shall take all requisite action to designate the
directors and officers of Holdco (subject to Sears\'s consent) and each of
the Merger Subs and to take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to
complete the organization of Holdco as contemplated by Sections 1.1 and 1.2
and the Merger Subs as contemplated by Section 1.3. Kmart (and,
if applicable, Sears) shall cause the directors of Holdco to ratify and
approve this Agreement and to cause the directors of the Merger Subs to
ratify and approve this Agreement.   1.5. Actions of Sears and Kmart. As
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Kmart, as
the holder of all the outstanding shares of Holdco Common Stock, shall cause
Holdco to enter into and become a party to this Agreement and adopt this
Agreement and shall cause Holdco, as the sole stockholder of each of the
Merger Subs, to cause the Merger Subs to enter into and become a party to
this Agreement and adopt this Agreement. Kmart shall cause Holdco, and Holdco
shall cause the Merger Subs, to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof the parties
shall cause this Agreement to be amended to add Holdco and the Merger Subs as
parties, and each Merger Sub shall become a constituent corporation in its
respective Merger.    2   1.6. The Mergers. At the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.7(c)):   (a) Sears Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Sears (the "Sears Merger"). Sears will be the surviving corporation in
the Sears Merger, and the separate existence of Sears Merger Sub shall cease.
As a result of the Sears Merger, Sears shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Holdco.   (b) Kmart Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Kmart
(the "Kmart Merger" and, together with the Sears Merger, the "Mergers").
Kmart will be the surviving corporation in the Kmart Merger, and the separate
existence of Kmart Merger Sub shall cease. As a result of the Kmart Merger,
Kmart shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Holdco.   (c) The Sears
Merger will have the effects set forth in the New York Business Corporation
Law (the "NYBCL"), and the Kmart Merger will have the effects set forth in
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").   1.7. Effective Time of
the Mergers. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date
(as defined in Section 1.8), the parties shall (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to) cause the following to occur:   (a) Sears Merger Sub and
Sears shall execute and deliver for filing a certificate of merger (the
"Sears Certificate of Merger") to the Department of State for the State of
New York, in such form and manner provided in the NYBCL. The applicable
parties thereto shall make all other filings or recordings required under
Section 904(b) and any other provision of the NYBCL to effect the Sears
Merger.   (b) Kmart Merger Sub and Kmart shall execute and deliver
for filing a certificate of merger (the "Kmart Certificate of Merger" and,
together with the Sears Certificate of Merger, the "Certificates of Merger")
to the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware, in such form and manner
provided in the DGCL. The applicable parties thereto shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Kmart Merger.  
(c) The Mergers shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificates of
Merger with the Department of State for the State of New York and the
Secretary of State for the State of Delaware or, in each case, at such time
thereafter as is provided in such Certificates of Merger as agreed
between the parties; provided that the Mergers shall become effective at the
same time (such time as the Mergers become effective, the "Effective
Time").   1.8. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the "Closing Date") that is the second
business day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or wavier or such conditions), unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017,
unless another place is agreed to in writing.   1.9. Certificates of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporations. (a) At the Effective
Time, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Sears shall
be    3  amended so as to read in their entirety as the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of Sears Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except for the agent and except that the surviving
corporation in the Sears Merger shall retain Sears\'s name.   (b) At the
Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of Kmart shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Kmart Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for the incorporator and
except that the surviving corporation in the Kmart Merger shall retain

Conversion of Sears Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Sears
Merger and without any action on the part of Holdco, Sears Merger Sub, Sears
or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion of Sears
Common Stock. Each common share, par value $0.75 per share, of Sears ("Sears
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Excluded Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(b)) and any
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a)) shall, subject to Sections
2.3 and 2.6(d), be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration (the "Sears Consideration"):   (i) Each share of Sears Common
Stock with respect to which an  election to receive cash (a "Cash Election")
has been effectively  made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2
(each, a "Cash  Electing Sears Share") shall be converted into the right to
receive  $50.00 in cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration").   (ii)
Each share of Sears Common Stock with respect to which an  election to
receive stock consideration (a "Stock Election") is  properly made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each,  a "Stock Electing Sears
Share" and, together with each Cash Electing  Sears Shares, an "Electing
Sears Share") shall be converted into the  right to receive 0.5 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio"), subject to  adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(d),
of validly issued,  fully paid and non-assessable shares of Holdco Common
Stock  (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco 
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6(d), the "Stock 
Consideration").   (iii) Each share of Sears Common Stock other than shares
of  Sears Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election or a Stock 
Election is properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to  Section 2.2
(each, a "Non-Electing Sears Share") shall be    4   converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration or the  Stock Consideration or a
combination of both, subject to Section  2.3.     (b) Sears and Kmart-
Owned Shares. Each share of Sears Common Stock owned by Sears or Sears Merger
Sub ("Cancelled Shares"), in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no consideration
shall be paid with respect thereto. Each share of Sears Common Stock owned by
Kmart or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sears or Kmart
(the "Converted Shares" and, together with the Cancelled Shares, the
"Excluded Shares"), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. The
Stock Consideration paid pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) shall not be subject
to proration under Section 2.3.   (c) Conversion of Sears Merger Sub Stock.
Each share of common stock of Sears Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully
paid and, subject to the NYBCL, non-assessable common share of Sears, as the
surviving corporation in the Sears Merger.   (d) Adjustments. If, after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, either (i) Kmart pays a dividend
in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by
reclassification any shares of Kmart Common Stock or (ii) Sears pays a
dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by
reclassification any shares of Sears Common Stock, then the Merger
Consideration and Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Sears Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of
such event, be the Merger Consideration, Exchange Ratio or other dependent
item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence.   2.2. Sears Election Procedures. (a) Not less than three
business days prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Kmart and Sears shall jointly designate a bank or trust company to act as
exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Sears Common Stock (the "Sears Certificates") and shares of Sears Common
Stock represented by book-entry ("Sears Book-Entry Shares").   (b) Each
person who, on or prior to the Election Date (as defined below), is a record
holder of shares of Sears Common Stock other than Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to specify the number of such holder\'s shares of Sears Common Stock
(and, if such shares to which the election relates are represented by Sears
Certificates, such particular shares) with respect to which such holder makes
a Cash Election or Stock Election.   (c) Holdco shall prepare and file as an
exhibit to the Form S-4 a form of election (the "Form of Election") in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Sears. The Form of Election shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
Sears Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Form of
Election and any Sears Certificates. Sears shall mail the Form of Election
with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as    5  defined in Section
5.1(a)) to all persons who are record holders of shares of Sears Common Stock
as of the record date for the Sears Stockholders Meeting (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)). The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of
shares of Sears Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the
beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) who wishes to
make a Cash Election or a Stock Election or a combination of both for any and
all shares of Sears Common Stock held by such holder. Sears shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election available to all persons
who become holders of shares of Sears Common Stock during the period between
the record date for the Sears Stockholders Meeting and the Election Date.  
(d) Any holder\'s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on (1) the date of the Sears Stockholders Meeting or (2) if the
Closing Date is more than four business days following the Sears Stockholders
Meeting, two business days preceding the Closing Date (the "Election Date"),
a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i)
Certificates representing the shares of Sears Common Stock to which such Form
of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable
for transfer on the books of Sears (or by an appropriate guarantee
of delivery of such Sears Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election
from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule
17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act")); provided that such Sears Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii)
in the case of Sears Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents required by
the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election or a
Stock Election is validly made with respect to any shares of Sears Common
Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on
the stock transfer books of Sears, unless and until such Cash Election or
Stock Election is properly revoked.   (e) Kmart and Sears shall publicly
announce the anticipated Election Date at least five business days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Date shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and
Kmart and Sears shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined,
the rescheduled Election Date.   (f) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may
be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Sears Common
Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Cash Elections and
Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VII. If a Cash Election or Stock
Election is revoked with respect to shares of Sears Common Stock represented
by Sears Certificates, Sears Certificates representing such shares shall be
promptly returned to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange
Agent.   (g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the
joint determination of Kmart and Sears, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as
to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly
made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2 and as to when Cash Elections,
Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent (or    6  Kmart and Sears jointly, in the event that the
Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make
all computations as to the proration contemplated by Section 2.3, and absent
manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange
Agent may, with the written agreement of Kmart, after Kmart\'s reasonable
consultation with Sears, make any rules as are consistent with this Section
2.2 for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections provided
for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash
Elections and Stock Elections.   2.3. Sears Proration. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to Sections 2.1(b)
and 2.4):   (a) The Cash Percentage (as defined below) of the shares
of Sears Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number, the "Cash
Cap Number") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and all other shares of Sears Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.
The "Cash Percentage" shall be equal to 45%, subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 2.1(d).   (b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing
shares of Sears Common Stock (such number, the "Cash Election Number")
exceeds the Cash Cap Number, then (i) all Stock Electing Sears Shares and
Non-Electing Sears Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and (ii) the number of Cash Electing Sears Shares of each
stockholder of Sears that shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of Cash Electing Sears Shares of such stockholder by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Cap Number and the denominator
of which is the Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such
holder\'s Cash Electing Sears Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration.   (c) If the Cash Election Number is less
than the Cash Cap Number (such difference between the Cash Election Number
and Cash Cap Number, the "Shortfall Number"), then (x) all Cash Electing
Sears Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and (y) the Stock Electing Sears Shares and Non-Electing Sears
Shares shall be treated in the following manner:   (i) if the Shortfall
Number is less than or equal to the  aggregate number of Non-Electing Sears
Shares, then (x) all Stock  Electing Sears Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the Stock Consideration and (y) the Non-Electing Sears
Shares of  each stockholder of Sears shall be converted into the right to 
receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of  Non-Electing
Sears Shares equal to the product obtained by  multiplying (1) the number of
Non-Electing Sears Shares of such  stockholder by (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the  Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is
the aggregate  number of Non-Electing Sears Shares, with the remaining number
of  such holder\'s Non-Electing Sears Shares being converted into the  right
to receive the Stock Consideration; or    7   (ii) if the Shortfall
Number exceeds the aggregate number of  Non-Electing Sears Shares, then (x)
all Non-Electing Sears Shares  shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration  and (y) the number of Stock Electing Sears Shares of
each  stockholder of Sears that shall be converted into the right to 
receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product  obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Stock Electing Sears  Shares of such
stockholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which  is the amount by which
the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate  number of Non-Electing Sears
Shares, and the denominator of which is  the aggregate number of Stock
Electing Sears Shares, with the  remaining number of such holder\'s Stock
Electing Sears Shares being  converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.   (d) For purposes of the calculations in this Section
2.3, shares of Sears Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be Non-Electing
Shares.   2.4. Sears Dissenting Shares. (a) Shares of Sears Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by holders of shares of Sears Common Stock who have properly
demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares
in accordance with Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights
as are granted by the NYBCL. If any such stockholder of Sears shall fail to
perfect or effectively shall withdraw or lose such stockholder\'s right to be
paid fair value under Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL, such stockholder\'s
shares of Sears Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable or issuable in respect of Non-Electing Sears Shares as
set forth in Section 2.3 of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.  
(b) Sears shall give Kmart (or, after the Closing, Holdco) (i) notice of any
notice received by Sears of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of
Sears Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other notices served
pursuant to Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL and received by Sears and (ii)
the opportunity to direct, jointly with Sears, all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to the exercise of such dissenters\' rights
under Sections 623 and 910 of the NYBCL. Sears shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Kmart (or, after the Closing, Holdco) or as
otherwise required by applicable law, make any payment with respect to any
such exercise of dissenters\' rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights.   2.5. Conversion of Kmart Securities. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Kmart Merger and without any action on the part of Holdco,
Kmart Merger Sub, Kmart or the holders of any of the following
securities:   (a) Conversion of Kmart Common Stock. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Kmart ("Kmart Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.5(b)) shall be converted into the
right to receive one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
Holdco Common Stock (the "Kmart Consideration" and, together with the Sears
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").    8   (b) Kmart and Sears-
Owned Shares. Each share of Kmart Common Stock owned by Kmart or Kmart Merger
Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled
without any conversion thereof, and no consideration shall be paid with
respect thereto. Each share of Kmart Common Stock owned by Sears or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sears or Kmart, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to
receive the Kmart Consideration.   (c) Conversion of Kmart Merger Sub Stock.
Each share of common stock of Kmart Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock of Kmart, as the surviving
corporation in the Kmart Merger.   (d) Cancellation of Holdco Common Stock.
Each share of Holdco Common Stock held by Kmart immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid with
respect thereto.   (e) Exchange of Certificates. Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Kmart Common
Stock (the "Kmart Certificates" and, together with the Sears Certificates,
the "Certificates") and shares of Kmart Common Stock represented by book-
entry ("Kmart Book-Entry Shares" and, together with the Sears Book-Entry
Shares, the "Book-Entry Shares") shall be exchanged in accordance with
Section 2.6.   2.6. Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Deposit of Merger
Consideration. (i) As of and from time to time after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
stockholders of Sears and Kmart, (A) certificates or, at Holdco\'s option,
evidence of shares in book entry form, representing shares of Holdco Common
Stock in denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (B)
cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this
Article II in respect of shares of Sears Common Stock for which Sears
Certificates or Sears Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the
Exchange Agent or the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares.
Such certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case may be) for
shares of Holdco Common Stock and such cash so deposited, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund".   (ii) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent by Holdco as directed by Holdco, provided
that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Cash Consideration
payable to holders of shares of Sears Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, and Holdco and Kmart
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of holders of shares of Sears Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income
produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund
and shall be payable to Holdco or Kmart, as Holdco directs.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall cause to be mailed to (x) each record holder, as of the
Effective    9  Time, of Non-Electing Sears Shares (such holders, "Non-
Electing Sears Holders") and (y) each record holder, as of the Effective
Time, of shares of Kmart Common Stock (such holders, "Former Kmart Holders"
and such shares, "Former Kmart Shares")): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such holder representing such Non-Electing Sears
Shares or Former Kmart Shares, as the case may be, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Such letter of
transmittal shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Holdco
may specify.   (ii) (x) Each former stockholder of Sears who properly
made and did not revoke a Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled
to receive in exchange for such stockholder\'s Electing Sears Shares the
following as specified in clauses (A) and (B), and (y) upon surrender by a
Non-Electing Sears Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
each Non-Electing Sears Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock, if any, into
which such holder\'s shares of Sears Common Stock represented by such
holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II (after taking
into account all shares of Sears Common Stock to which an election or non-
election of the same type were made), and such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an
amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to Section 2.6(g)) equal to (I) the amount of cash
(including the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional interests in
shares of Holdco Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6(d)), if any,
into which such holder\'s shares of Sears Common Stock represented by such
holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II, plus (II) any
cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.6(c).   (iii) Upon surrender by a Former
Kmart Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each Former Kmart
Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) the number of
whole shares of Holdco Common Stock into which such holder\'s shares of Kmart
Common Stock represented by such holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this
Article II, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.6(g)) equal
to any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(c).   (iv) If payment or issuance of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a   
10  condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to
the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or
is not applicable. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the
posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Sears Common Stock or Kmart Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented by the Certificate pursuant to this Article II.   (v) No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II, the issuance or payment of which (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all
rights pertaining to shares of Sears Common Stock converted in the Sears
Merger and shares of Kmart Common Stock converted in the Kmart Merger.  
(vi) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Sears and Kmart shall
be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Sears Common Stock or Kmart Common Stock, respectively, that
were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to Sears or Kmart for transfer
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.   (c)
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable with
respect to the shares of Sears Common Stock or Kmart Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in
this Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to
the holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to those shares of Holdco Common Stock
with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to those shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record
date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender.   (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
evidencing Sears Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will   
11  not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Holdco. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, Holdco shall pay each holder of Sears Common Stock an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
shares of Sears Common Stock held at the Effective Time and for which an
election or non-election of the same type was made by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled, by (b) the closing price on the NASDAQ National Market
("Nasdaq") for a share of Kmart Common Stock on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.   (e) Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
stockholders of Sears and Kmart on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Holdco, upon demand by Holdco, and any
stockholders of Sears or Kmart who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim
for any part of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Holdco Common Stock.   (f) No Liability. None of Kmart, Sears or Holdco
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Sears Common Stock or Kmart Common
Stock for cash or shares of Holdco Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (g) Withholding. Holdco and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Sears Common
Stock, Dissenting Shares or shares of Kmart Common Stock such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Sears Common Stock, Dissenting Shares or shares of Kmart
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Holdco or the Exchange Agent.   2.7. Sears Options, Etc. (a) The Board of
Directors of Sears or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all action
necessary so that:   (i) Each option or other right to acquire Sears Common
Stock  under any Sears Stock Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(b)) (a "Sears 
Stock Option") and any stock appreciation right granted under any  Sears
Stock Plan (a "Sears SAR"), which, in each case, is  outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested  or unvested) shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to represent an  option or other right to acquire, or
to be a stock appreciation  right with respect to, as the case may be, shares
of Sears Common  Stock and shall instead represent the right to receive, as
soon as  practicable after the Effective Time, an amount of cash equal to
the  product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Sears Option Cash-Out 
Amount of a share of Sears Common Stock over (B) the exercise price  per
share of such stock option or stock appreciation right  multiplied by (ii)
the    12   number of shares of Sears Common Stock subject to such stock
option  or stock appreciation right, less any required withholding taxes. 
For the purposes of this Section 2.7, the "Sears Option Cash-Out  Amount" of
a share of Sears Common Stock means the sum of (x) the  Cash Percentage
multiplied by the Cash Consideration, plus (y) the  product of (1) the Stock
Percentage (as defined below) multiplied by  (2) the product of the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the closing  price on Nasdaq for a share of Kmart Common
Stock on the last  trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. The
"Stock  Percentage" means 100% minus the Cash Percentage.   (ii) Each
issued and outstanding share of Sears Common Stock  subject to vesting or
other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Sears  Stock Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a "Restricted  Sears Share") shall, as of the
Effective Time, vest and become free  of such restrictions to the extent
required by the terms thereof and  shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration  in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and
the other provisions of  this Article II; provided that any fractional shares
resulting from  such conversion shall be rounded to the nearest whole share;
and  provided, further, that all Holdco Common Stock issuable upon 
conversion of such Restricted Sears Shares shall be subject to the  same
terms (including the vesting terms taking into account any  required
acceleration thereof by virtue of the transactions  contemplated hereby) as
were applicable to such Restricted Sears  Shares in respect of which they are
issued; and   (iii) All stock-based awards, other than Sears Stock
Options,  Sears SARs and Restricted Sears Shares ("Other Sears Stock-Based 
Awards"), granted under any Sears Stock Plan and outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective  Time, vest and become
free of restrictions to the extent required by  the terms thereof and shall
be converted automatically at the  Effective Time into a right or award with
respect to a number of  shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of  shares of Sears Common Stock subject to such Other Sears
Stock-Based  Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; provided that all such 
converted stock-based rights or awards shall be subject to the same  terms
(including the vesting terms taking into account any required  acceleration
thereof by virtue of the transactions contemplated  hereby) as were
applicable to such Other Sears Stock-Based Awards in  respect of which they
are issued.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall deliver to the holders of Restricted Sears Shares and Other
Sears Stock-Based Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders\'
rights pursuant to the Sears Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Restricted Sears Shares and Other Sears Stock-Based Awards, as
the case may be, shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.7 after giving effect
to the Sears Merger and the assumption by Holdco as set forth above).   (c)
Holdco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a

appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Holdco Common
Stock subject    13  to such Sears equity awards and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained

respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Sears Merger will be
subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act, where applicable, Holdco shall administer the Sears Stock Plans assumed
pursuant to this Section 2.7 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3

committee thereof shall take all action necessary so that:   (i) Each option
or other right to acquire Kmart Common Stock  granted under any Kmart Stock
Plan (as defined in Section 3.2(b)) (a  "Kmart Stock Option") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to represent  an option or other right to acquire
shares of Kmart Common Stock and  shall be converted, at the Effective Time,
into an option to  acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under  the Kmart Stock Option (but taking into account any changes
thereto  provided for in the applicable Kmart Stock Plan, in any award 
agreement or in such option), that number of shares of Holdco Common  Stock
equal to the number of shares of Kmart Common Stock subject to  such Kmart
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, at  a price per share
equal to the per share exercise price specified in  such Kmart Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time;   (ii) Each issued and outstanding
share of Kmart Common Stock  subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions
pursuant to the Kmart  Stock Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Restricted  Kmart Share") shall, as of the Effective Time, vest and become
free  of such restrictions to the extent required by the terms thereof and 
shall be converted into the right to receive the Kmart Consideration  in
accordance with Section 2.5(a) and the other provisions of this  Article II;
provided that all Holdco Common Stock issuable upon  conversion of such
Restricted Kmart Shares shall be subject to the  same terms (including the
vesting terms) as were applicable to such  Restricted Kmart Shares in respect
of which they are issued; and   (iii) All stock-based awards, other than
Kmart Stock Options  and Restricted Kmart Shares ("Other Kmart Stock-Based
Awards"),  granted under any Kmart Stock Plan and outstanding immediately
prior  to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, vest and 
become free of restrictions to the extent required by the terms  thereof and
shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time  into a right or award
with respect to the same number of shares of  Holdco Common Stock as they
represented with respect to shares of  Kmart Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time; provided  that all such converted stock-based rights
or awards shall be  subject to the same terms (including the vesting terms)
as were  applicable to such Other Kmart Stock-Based Awards in respect of 
which they are issued.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Holdco shall deliver to the holders of Kmart Stock Options, Restricted
Kmart Shares and Other Kmart Stock-Based Awards    14  appropriate
notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the Kmart Stock
Plans, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Kmart Stock Options,
Restricted Kmart Shares and Other Kmart Stock-Based Awards, as the case may
be, shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.8 after giving effect to the
Kmart Merger and the assumption by Holdco as set forth above).   (c) Holdco
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Holdco Common Stock for delivery with respect
to Kmart Stock Options, Restricted Kmart Shares and Other Kmart Stock-Based
Awards assumed by it in accordance with this Section 2.8. As of the Effective
Time, if requested by Kmart prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock subject to such Kmart
equity awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Kmart
equity awards remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals
who subsequent to the Kmart Merger will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable,
Holdco shall administer the Kmart Stock Plans assumed pursuant to this
Section 2.8 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act to the extent the applicable Kmart Stock Plan complied with such
rule prior to the Kmart Merger.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND

its Subsidiaries relative to other similarly situated participants in the
industries in which they operate), (B) changes or events, after the date

value of, Sears Common Stock, has been conferred on any   
16  individual or entity (such stock options, units and other awards and

Sears Common Stock were held by Sears in its treasury or by its Subsidiaries;
and (B) no shares of Sears Preferred Stock were outstanding or reserved for
issuance. All outstanding shares of Sears Common Stock have been duly

the NYBCL, non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights.   (ii)
No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness generally having the right

Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or any Voting
Debt or stock appreciation rights of Sears or of any Subsidiary of Sears or
obligating Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no

to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of
Sears or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) pursuant to which Sears or any of
its Subsidiaries is or could be required to register shares of Sears Common
Stock or other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), except any such contractual obligations entered into after
the date hereof as permitted by Section 4.1.   (iv) Since October 30, 2004,
except as permitted by Section 4.1, Sears has not (A) issued or permitted to
be issued any shares of capital stock, stock appreciation rights or
securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of
capital stock of Sears or any of its Subsidiaries, other than pursuant to and

options and other awards issued under the Sears Stock Plans prior to the date
hereof (or issued after the date hereof in compliance with Sections 4.1(c)
and 4.1(k)); (B) repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or
indirectly through one or more Sears Subsidiaries, any shares of capital
stock of Sears or any of its Subsidiaries; or (C) declared, set aside, made

outstanding shares of capital stock of Sears, other than regular

Sears prior to the date hereof.   (v) The Sears employee stock purchase
plan (A) will continue until the Closing Date, and no further purchase
periods will commence thereafter, and (B) will be terminated by Sears
immediately prior to and effective as of the Closing Date. The optional cash
purchase (but not the dividend reinvestment) feature of any Sears dividend
reinvestment and stock purchase plan will be terminated within 30 days of a
written request by Kmart unless all    17  such optional cash purchases
are satisfied through open market purchases of Sears Common Stock and not
through new issuances of Sears Common Stock by Sears.   (c) Authority. (i)
Sears has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject in the case of the consummation of the Sears Merger to
the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Sears Vote, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Sears,
subject in the case of the consummation of the Sears Merger to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Sears Vote. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Sears and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Sears, enforceable against Sears in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights and to general equitable principles.   (ii) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, (A) conflict with, or result in
any violation of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or
the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other
encumbrance on any assets (any such conflict, violation, default, right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a "Violation")
pursuant to, any provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of Sears or equivalent governing documents of any Significant
Subsidiary of Sears, or (B) subject to obtaining or making the consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings
referred to in paragraph (iii) below, result in any Violation of any loan or
credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, Sears Benefit Plan (as
defined in Section 3.1(j)) or other agreement, obligation,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Sears or any
Subsidiary of Sears or their respective properties or assets, which
Violation, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
(x) have a material adverse effect on Sears or (y) prevent, materially delay
or materially impede Sears\'s ability to perform its obligations hereunder or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (iii) No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or self-regulatory
organization (a "Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to
Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Sears or the consummation by Sears of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the failure to make or obtain
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (x)
have a material adverse effect on Sears or (y) prevent, materially delay or
materially impede Sears\'s ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (A) the filing
with the SEC of (1) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (2) such reports
under Sections 13(a), 13(d), 13(g) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and the obtaining from the SEC of such orders as may be required in
connection therewith, (B) the filing of the Sears Certificate of   
18  Merger with the applicable Governmental Entities required by the NYBCL,
(C) notices or filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and (D) such authorizations required
pursuant the Competition Act (Canada) and the Investment Canada Act of 1985
(Canada) (collectively, the "Canadian Antitrust Laws" and, together with the
HSR Act, the "Applicable Antitrust Laws").   (d) SEC Documents; Undisclosed
Liabilities. (i) Sears has filed all required reports, schedules,
registration statements and other documents with the SEC since December 29,
2002 (the "Sears SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof,
as of the date of such filing), the Sears SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Sears SEC Documents, and none of the Sears SEC Documents
when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of Sears included in the Sears SEC
Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be disclosed therein) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Sears and its consolidated
Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders\' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and
for the periods shown. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding
written comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Sears SEC
Documents.   (ii) Except for (A) those liabilities that are
appropriately reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial
statements of Sears included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2004, as filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof, (B) liabilities incurred since October 2, 2004 in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, (C) liabilities that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Sears, (D) liabilities incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by, or permitted by, this Agreement, and (E)
liabilities or obligations discharged or paid in full prior to the date
hereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
Sears and its Subsidiaries do not have, any liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that
are required to be reflected in Sears\'s financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.   (e) Information Supplied.
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Sears for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the
times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with
the Mergers, contain any untrue statement of a    19  material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement relating to the
Sears Stockholders Meeting will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Sears with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Kmart for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   (f) Compliance with Applicable
Laws and Reporting Requirements. (i) Sears and its Subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities that are material to the operation of the businesses of
Sears and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Sears Permits"), and Sears
and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with the terms of the
Sears Permits and all applicable laws and regulations, except where the
failure so to hold or comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Sears. The
businesses of Sears and its Subsidiaries are not being and have not been
conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any
Governmental Entity (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Sears. To the
knowledge of Sears, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect
to Sears or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in
each case, those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Sears.   (ii) Sears and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain
a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Sears (A) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Sears in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms and is accumulated
and communicated to Sears\'s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to
the date hereof, to Sears\'s auditors and the audit committee of Sears\'s
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Sears\'s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Sears\'s internal controls over
financial reporting. Sears has made available to Kmart a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to Sears\'s auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2002.   (g) Legal Proceedings. There is no claim, suit,
action, investigation or other demand or proceeding (whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of Sears,
threatened, against or affecting Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on    20  Sears, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears having or that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on Sears or on Holdco after the Effective Time. No claim,
suit, action, investigation, demand or proceeding alleging that Sears or any
of its Subsidiaries is liable for asbestos-related matters, individually or
in the aggregate, has, and none of them would reasonably be likely to have, a
material adverse effect on Sears.   (h) Taxes. Sears and each of its
Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any
of them and have paid (or Sears has paid on their behalf) all taxes shown as
due on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in
the Sears SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Sears and
its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No
material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed against Sears or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately reserved for. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "tax"
(including, with correlative meaning, the terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall
mean (i) all Federal, state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise,
gross receipts, payroll, sales, employment, use, property, withholding,
excise, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with
respect to such amounts, (ii) liability for the payment of any amounts of the
type described in clause (i) as a result of being or having been a member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (iii) liability
for the payment of any amounts as a result of being party to any tax sharing
agreement or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify
any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type
described in clause (i) or (ii). Neither Sears nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the exchange
of Sears Common Stock and Kmart Common Stock for Holdco Common Stock pursuant
to the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code.   (i) Certain Agreements. Except for this
Agreement, neither Sears nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to
the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any
consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $2.0 million
or more per annum, (ii) that is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) that limits
the ability of Sears or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of
business, in any geographic area or with any person, or that requires
referrals of business and, in each case, which limitation or requirement
would reasonably be expected to be material to Sears and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (iv) in the case of a Sears Benefit Plan, any of the
benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which
will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) that would prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. All contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings
of the type described in this Section 3.1(i) (collectively referred to herein
as the "Sears Contracts") are valid and in full force and effect, except to
the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if
the failure    21  to be in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Sears. Neither Sears nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the knowledge
of Sears, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of,
or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists,
which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a
default under the provisions of, any Sears Contract, except in each case for
those violations and defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on
Sears.   (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each employee benefit plan
(including any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
including multiemployer plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) and
all stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control,
fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation and other material employee benefit plans, agreements, programs,
policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether
formal or informal, oral or written, legally binding or not (all the
foregoing being herein called "Benefit Plans"), under which any employee or
former employee of Sears or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future
right to benefits, maintained or contributed to by Sears or any of its
Subsidiaries or under which Sears or any of its Subsidiaries has any present
or future liability (the "Sears Benefit Plans"), Sears has made available to
Kmart a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent annual report (Form
5500) filed with the IRS, if any, (B) such Sears Benefit Plan, (C) each trust
agreement relating to such Sears Benefit Plan, if any, (D) the most recent
summary plan description for each Sears Benefit Plan for which a summary plan
description is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to a Sears Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, and
(F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to
any Sears Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
if any.   (ii) With respect to the Sears Benefit Plans, individually
and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Sears,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which
Sears or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Sears under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.   (iii) True and complete
copies of the Sears Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof have been
provided or made available to Kmart.   (iv) No Sears Benefit Plan or Sears
Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or former
employee of Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears of any money or other property
or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any present or
former employee of Sears or any Subsidiary of Sears, in each case, as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not
such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code
Section 280G.   (k) Subsidiaries. Exhibit 21 to Sears\'s Annual Report on

Kmart has filed all required reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents with the SEC since May 6, 2003 (the "Kmart SEC Documents").
As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing), the Kmart SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Kmart
SEC Documents, and none of the Kmart SEC Documents when filed contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of Kmart included in the Kmart SEC Documents complied as
to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be disclosed
therein) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Kmart and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the
consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders\' equity and cash
flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown. As of the
date hereof, there are no outstanding written comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Kmart SEC Documents.   (ii) Except for (A) those
liabilities that are appropriately reflected or reserved for in the
consolidated financial statements of Kmart included in its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 28, 2004, as filed with the
SEC prior to the date hereof, (B) liabilities incurred since July 28, 2004 in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (C)
liabilities that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Kmart, (D) liabilities incurred
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by, or permitted by, this
Agreement, and (E) liabilities or obligations discharged or paid in full
prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, Kmart and its Subsidiaries do not have, any liabilities
or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that are required to be reflected in Kmart\'s
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.   (e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Kmart for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in
connection with the Mergers, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(other than the Proxy Statement relating to the Sears Stockholders Meeting)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities    28  Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Kmart with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Sears for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4.   (f) Compliance with
Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements. (i) Kmart and its Subsidiaries
hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of
all Governmental Entities that are material to the operation of the
businesses of Kmart and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Kmart
Permits"), and Kmart and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance
with the terms of the Kmart Permits and all applicable laws and regulations,
except where the failure so to hold or comply, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Kmart. The businesses of Kmart and its Subsidiaries are not being and have
not been conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any
Governmental Entity (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Kmart. To the
knowledge of Kmart, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect
to Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in
each case, those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Kmart.   (ii) Kmart and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain
a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Kmart (A) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Kmart in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms and is accumulated
and communicated to Kmart\'s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to
the date hereof, to Kmart\'s auditors and the audit committee of Kmart\'s
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Kmart\'s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Kmart\'s internal controls over
financial reporting. Kmart has made available to Sears a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to Kmart\'s auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2002.   (g) Legal Proceedings. There is no claim, suit,
action, investigation or other demand or proceeding (whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of Kmart,
threatened, against or affecting Kmart or any Subsidiary of Kmart that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on Kmart, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Kmart
or any Subsidiary of Kmart having, or that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on   
29  Kmart or on Holdco after the Effective Time. No claim, suit,
action, investigation, demand or proceeding alleging that Kmart or any of
its Subsidiaries is liable for asbestos-related matters, individually or in
the aggregate, has, and none of them would reasonably be likely to have, a
material adverse effect on Kmart.   (h) Taxes. Kmart and each of its
Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any
of them and have paid (or Kmart has paid on their behalf) all taxes shown as
due on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in
the Kmart SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Kmart and
its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No
material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed against Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately reserved for. Neither Kmart nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that
would reasonably be expected to prevent the exchange of Sears Common Stock
and Kmart Common Stock for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a transaction described in Section 351 of the
Code or the Kmart Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (i) Certain Agreements. Except for
this Agreement, neither Kmart nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with
respect to the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any
consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $2.0 million
or more per annum, (ii) that is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) that limits
the ability of Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of
business, in any geographic area or with any person, or that requires
referrals of business and, in each case, which limitation or requirement
would reasonably be expected to be material to Kmart and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (iv) in the case of a Kmart Benefit Plan, any of the
benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which
will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) that would prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. All contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings
of the type described in this Section 3.2(i) (collectively referred to herein
as "Kmart Contracts") are valid and in full force and effect, except to the
extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Kmart.
Neither Kmart nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the knowledge of Kmart,
none of the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists,
which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a
default under the provisions of, any Kmart Contract, except in each case for
those violations and defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on
Kmart.   (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each Benefit Plan, under
which any employee or former employee of Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries has
any present or future right to benefits, maintained or contributed to
by Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries or under which    30  Kmart or any
of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (the "Kmart Benefit
Plans"), Kmart has made available to Sears a true and correct copy of (A) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, if any, (B) such
Kmart Benefit Plan, (C) each trust agreement relating to such Kmart
Benefit Plan, if any, (D) the most recent summary plan description for each
Kmart Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required by ERISA,
(E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Kmart Benefit
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, and (F) the most recent determination
letter issued by the IRS with respect to any Kmart Benefit Plan qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, if any.   (ii) With respect to the Kmart
Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and,
to the knowledge of Kmart, there exists no condition or set of circumstances
in connection with which Kmart or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to
any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Kmart under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.   (iii)
True and complete copies of the Kmart Stock Plans as in effect on the date
hereof have been provided or made available to Sears.   (iv) No Kmart
Benefit Plan or Kmart Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to
any present or former employee of Kmart or any Subsidiary of Kmart of any
money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits
to any present or former employee of Kmart or any Subsidiary of Kmart, in
each case, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the
meaning of Code Section 280G.   (k) Subsidiaries. Exhibit 21 to Kmart\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2004 filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof includes all the Subsidiaries of Kmart
that are Significant Subsidiaries. All of the shares of capital stock of each
of the Subsidiaries held by Kmart or by another Subsidiary of Kmart are fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by Kmart or a Subsidiary of Kmart free
and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance.   (l) Absence of Certain
Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Kmart SEC Documents filed prior
to the date hereof (or, in the case of actions taken after the date hereof,
except as permitted by Section 4.2), since July 28, 2004, (i) Kmart and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
course consistent with their past practices and (ii) there has not been any

performance of each party\'s internal controls over financial reporting) to
the extent such consultation is not in violation of applicable laws,
including laws regarding the exchange of information and other laws regarding
competition.   4.4. Advice of Changes; Government Filings. Each party shall
confer on a regular and frequent basis with the other, report on operational
matters and promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any change or
event having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, a material
adverse effect on such party or that would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of such party
contained herein; provided, however, that any noncompliance with the
foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set
forth in Article VI or give rise to any right of termination under Article
VII unless the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a
failure or give rise to such a right. Sears and Kmart shall file all reports
required to be filed by each of them (or their Subsidiaries) with the SEC
between the date hereof and the Effective Time and shall deliver to the other
party copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. Each of
Sears and Kmart shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties agrees to
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will
consult with the other party with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other party apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   4.5. Control of Other Party\'s Business. Nothing contained in
this Agreement (including Section 4.3) shall give Kmart, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Sears or shall
give Sears, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Kmart prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of Sears and Kmart shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries\' respective operations.    41   ARTICLE V  ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS   5.1. Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings. (a)
(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Kmart
and Sears shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the
SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials that shall constitute the proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the Sears
stockholders at the Sears Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(b))
and to the Kmart stockholders at the Kmart Stockholders Meeting (as defined
in Section 5.1(c)) (such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments
or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"), and Holdco
shall prepare, together with Kmart and Sears, and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect to the issuance of Holdco
Common Stock in the Mergers (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Form S-4").   (ii) Each of Holdco, Kmart and Sears shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared
by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC, to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and to mail the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to their respective stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective. Kmart and Sears shall,
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party
with copies of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
received from the SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide the other party with a
copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Holdco shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable
state securities laws in connection with the Mergers and each party shall
furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.   (iii)
Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Holdco Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to either of the parties, or their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either
party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the extent required
by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Sears and Kmart.    42   (b) Sears
shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date
upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "Sears Stockholders Meeting")
for the purpose of obtaining the Required Sears Vote with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it is permitted to
make a Change in Sears Recommendation (as defined below) pursuant to Section
5.4(b), shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of its
stockholders of the matters comprising the Required Sears Vote; and the Board
of Directors of Sears shall recommend approval of the matters comprising the
Required Sears Vote by the stockholders of Sears to the effect as set forth
in Section 3.1(m) (the "Sears Recommendation") and shall not (x) withdraw or
modify (or propose to withdraw or modify) in any manner adverse to Kmart such
recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other statement in
connection with the Sears Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such
recommendation (collectively, a "Change in Sears Recommendation"), except as
and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.4(b). Notwithstanding
any Change in Sears Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the stockholders of Sears at the Sears Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of approving the matters comprising the Required Sears Vote, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Sears of such obligation.   (c)
Kmart shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the
date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the "Kmart Stockholders
Meeting" and, together with the Sears Stockholders Meeting, the "Required
Stockholders Meetings") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Kmart Vote
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless
it is permitted to make a Change in Kmart Recommendation (as defined below)
pursuant to Section 5.4(b), shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the
approval of its stockholders of the matters comprising the Required
Kmart Vote; and the Board of Directors of Kmart shall recommend approval of
the matters comprising the Required Kmart Vote by the stockholders of Kmart
to the effect as set forth in Section 3.2(m) (the "Kmart Recommendation") and
shall not (x) withdraw or modify (or propose to withdraw or modify) in any
manner adverse to Sears such recommendation or (y) take any other action or
make any other statement in connection with the Kmart Stockholders Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (a "Change in Kmart Recommendation"),
except as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.4(b).
Notwithstanding any Change in Kmart Recommendation, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Kmart at the Kmart Stockholders Meeting for
the purpose of approving the matters comprising the Required Kmart Vote, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Kmart of such
obligation.   (d) Sears and Kmart shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Sears Stockholders Meeting and the Kmart
Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same date.   5.2. Access to
Information; Confidentiality. (a) Upon reasonable notice, Sears and Kmart
shall each (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford
to the employees, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, records and
officers and, during such period, each of Sears and Kmart shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request.    43  Any such investigation shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of Sears or Kmart, as the case may be. Neither party
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. To the extent
practicable, the parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.   (b) The parties will hold any such information that
is nonpublic in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the provisions of the letters dated March 16, 2004 (as amended June 29,
2004), and November 10, 2004, between Sears and Kmart (collectively, the
"Confidentiality Agreements"), which Confidentiality Agreements will remain
in full force and effect.   (c) No such investigation by either Kmart or
Sears shall affect the representations and warranties of the other.   5.3.
Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
laws, rules and regulations to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, filings and
other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (as defined herein) and all other consents, waivers,
orders, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect or delay the ability of the parties to obtain all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party agrees (i) to make, as promptly as practicable, (A) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (which filing shall be
made in any event within 15 business days of the date hereof), and (B)
appropriate filings with the applicable Governmental Entities under the
Canadian Antitrust Laws within the time periods specified thereunder to
effect a Closing as soon as practicable, and (ii) in each case, to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to such Applicable Antitrust Laws or
by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and the receipt of all such consents, waivers, orders, approvals, permits,
rulings, authorizations and clearances under such other Applicable Antitrust
Laws or from such authorities as soon as practicable.   (b) Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 5.3 shall require, or be deemed to require, (i) Kmart
or Sears (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to take any action, agree
to take any action or consent to the taking of any action (including with
respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise    44  disposing of any
business or assets or conducting its (or its Subsidiaries\') business in any
specified manner) if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Holdco after
the Effective Time, or (ii) Kmart or Sears (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) to take any such action that is not conditional on
the consummation of the Mergers. Neither party shall take or agree to take
any action identified in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence without
the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (c) Each of Kmart and Sears shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.3(a), use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other party of the status of any of the matters
contemplated hereby, including providing the other party with a copy of any
written communication (or summary of oral communications) received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental
Entity and of any written communication (or summary of oral communications)
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
consult with each other in advance to the extent practicable of any meeting
or conference with any such Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any such other person, and to the extent
permitted by any such Governmental Entity or other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.   (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the parties contained in this Section 5.3, (i) if (A) any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
law, rule, regulation, order or decree (including the Applicable Antitrust
Laws), (B) any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental Entity or private party
challenging the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any law, rule, regulation, order or decree (including the
Applicable Antitrust Laws) or that would otherwise prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or (C) any law, rule, regulation, order or
decree is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity
that would make the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or would otherwise prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
then (ii) each of Sears and Kmart shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections, actions or proceedings so as to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
subject to Section 5.3(b), selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing
of or conducting its or its Subsidiaries\' business or asset in a specified
manner, or agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct
its or its Subsidiaries\' business or assets in a specified manner, which
would resolve such objections, actions or proceedings.   (e) In furtherance
and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this
Section 5.3, but subject to first complying with the obligations of Section
5.3(d), if any of the events specified in Section 5.3(d)(i)(B) or (C) occurs,
then each of Kmart    45  and Sears shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and use its reasonable best efforts, subject to Section 5.3(b), to
contest and resist any such administrative or judicial action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction
or other decree or order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prevents, materially delays or materially impedes the
consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to have such law, rule, regulation, order or decree repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Kmart and Sears
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend, at its own cost and expense,
any such administrative or judicial actions or proceedings.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.3 shall limit a party\'s right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such party has up
to then complied with its obligations under this Section 5.3.   (g) Holdco
shall agree to execute and deliver, at or prior to the Effective Time,
supplemental indentures and other instruments required for the due
assumption, as determined by the parties, of Sears\'s and
Kmart\'s outstanding debt, guarantees and other securities to the extent
required by the terms of such debt, guarantees and securities and the
instruments and agreements relating thereto, and Sears shall assist Holdco in
accomplishing the same.   (h) Each of Sears and Kmart and their respective
Boards of Directors shall, if any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price"
or other anti-takeover law or regulation becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Mergers, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, use
all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such law or regulation on this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.   5.4. Acquisition Proposals. (a) Each of
Kmart and Sears agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect
to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries (other than any such transaction permitted by Section 4.1(e) or
(f) in the case of Sears, and Section 4.2(e) or (f) in the case of Kmart) or
any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including
stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its
voting securities that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the
stockholders of such person) beneficially owning securities representing 20%
or more of its total voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such
transaction) or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer
or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other party to
this    46  Agreement or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred
to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussions with or provide
any confidential information or data to any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, either party or
its Board of Directors shall be permitted to (A) to the extent applicable and
subject to Section 5.4(g) and being otherwise in compliance with this Section
5.4(b), comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or make any other disclosure
required by law or its fiduciary duties (other than with respect to matters
covered by clauses (B) or (C)), (B) effect a Change in Sears Recommendation
or a Change in Kmart Recommendation (as applicable, a "Change in
Recommendation"), or (C) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any confidential information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such person first
made after the date hereof, if and only to the extent that,   (i) in any
such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above,  (I) such party\'s Required
Stockholders Meeting shall not have  occurred, (II) such party has complied
in all material respects with  this Section 5.4, and (III) its Board of
Directors, after  consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in
good  faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with  its
fiduciary duties under applicable law,   (ii) in the case of clause (B)
above, (I) it has received an  unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from a third  party and its Board of Directors, after consultation
with its  outside legal counsel and financial advisors, concludes in good 
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal  (as
defined below) (after giving effect to all of the proposed  revisions to this
Agreement which may be offered by the other party  to this Agreement pursuant
to clause (III) below), (II) it has  notified the other party to this
Agreement, at least four business  days in advance, of its intention to
effect a Change in  Recommendation, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such  Superior Proposal and the identity of the party making
such Superior  Proposal, and furnishing to the other party to this Agreement
a copy  of any relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party 
making such Superior Proposal and any other material documents  received by
it or its representatives, and (III) prior to effecting  such a Change in
Recommendation, it has, and has caused its  financial and legal advisors to,
negotiate with the other party to  this Agreement in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms  and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Acquisition Proposal  would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and  
(iii) in the case of clause (C) above, its Board of Directors,  after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial  advisors, concludes in
good faith that there is a reasonable  likelihood that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is  reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, and prior to  providing any information or data to any person   
47   in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, its 
Board of Directors receives from such person an executed  confidentiality
agreement having provisions that are no less  favorable to the party
providing such information than those  contained in the Confidentiality
Agreements.   (c) Each of Kmart and Sears shall notify the other party
to this Agreement as promptly as practicable of any such inquiries, proposals
or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, it or
any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
identity of such person and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and
any related available material documentation or correspondence), and in any
event each of Kmart and Sears shall provide written notice to the other party
of such inquiries, proposals, offers, requests for information and initiation
of such discussions or negotiations within 24 hours of such event. Each of
Kmart and Sears agrees that it will promptly keep the other party informed of
the status and material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers
(including whether withdrawn or rejected), the status and nature of all
information requested and delivered, and the status and material terms of any
such discussions or negotiations, and in any event each of Kmart and Sears
shall provide the other party with written notice of any material development
thereto within 24 hours thereof. Each of Kmart and Sears also agrees to
provide the other party hereto with any information that it provides to the
third party making the request therefor at substantially the same time it
provides such information to such third party, unless the other party hereto
has already been provided with such information.   (d) Sears agrees that (i)
it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers,
directors, agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Sears agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its
and its Subsidiaries\' respective directors, officers, key employees, agents
and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4. Sears
shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request, to the extent it has
a contractual right to do so, that each person, if any, that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement within the six months prior to the date
hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished
to any person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.   (e)
Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall (x) permit either party to terminate this
Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under this
Agreement. Neither party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers prior to the termination of
this Agreement.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
Kmart or Sears, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the
proposal and the    48  person making the proposal (including any break-
up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation):
(i) is more favorable to the stockholders of Kmart or Sears, as the case may
be, from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement committed to in writing by Kmart or Sears, as
the case may be, in response to such Acquisition Proposal), (ii) is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to
receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, and (iii) with
respect to Sears only, satisfies such other considerations contemplated in
clauses (1) and (2) of Section 717(b) of the NYBCL; provided that, for
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition
Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4(a),
except that the reference to "20% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition
Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving Kmart or
Sears, as the case may be.   (g) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(A) shall be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation, unless the Board of Directors of the
party making such disclosure expressly (i) reaffirms its recommendation to
its stockholders in favor of the applicable Merger and (ii) rejects such
other Acquisition Proposal.   5.5. Affiliates. Each of Sears and Kmart shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause each person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) to deliver to Holdco, as soon
as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the Sears Stockholders
Meeting or the Kmart Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, a written agreement
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.5.   5.6. Stock Exchange
Listing. Holdco and Kmart shall use all reasonable efforts to cause (i) the
shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued in the Mergers and (ii) the shares
of Holdco Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any
Other Sears Stock-Based Awards, Kmart Stock Options and Other Kmart Stock-
Based Awards, to be approved for listing on either Nasdaq or NYSE (as to be
agreed by the parties), subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.   5.7. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Kmart and Sears agree that,
except as otherwise provided herein (including as set forth in Section 5.7(a)
of the Sears Disclosure Schedule or Section 5.7(a) of the Kmart Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable) and unless otherwise mutually determined, the Kmart
Benefit Plans and Sears Benefit Plans in effect at the date hereof shall
remain in effect after the Effective Time with respect to employees covered
by such plans at the Effective Time, until such time as Holdco shall
otherwise determine, subject to applicable laws and the terms of such plans.
Prior to and following the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate in
good faith to formulate Benefit Plans for Holdco and its Subsidiaries, with
respect both to employees who were covered by the Kmart Benefit Plans and
Sears Benefit Plans at the Effective Time and employees who were not covered
by such plans at the Effective Time, that provide benefits for services on a
basis that does not discriminate between employees who were   
49  covered by the Kmart Benefit Plans and employees who were covered by the
Sears Benefit Plans.   (b) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any
Holdco employees who are employees of Kmart or Sears (or their Subsidiaries)
prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, and in which such Holdco employees did not participate
prior to the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Holdco shall: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Holdco employees
and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent
such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under
the analogous Kmart Benefit Plan or Sears Benefit Plan, as the case may be;
(ii) provide each Holdco employee and their eligible dependents with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a
Kmart Benefit Plan or Sears Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit
was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all service of the Holdco employees with
Kmart or Sears, and their respective affiliates, for all purposes (including,
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to
benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit
accrual) in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such service is taken
into account under the applicable New Plan and only to the extent such
service was credited under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits.   (c) With respect to Benefit Plans
maintained or contributed to outside the United States for the benefit of
non-United States citizens or residents, the principles set forth in the
preceding paragraph of this Section 5.7 shall apply to the extent the
application of such principles does not violate applicable foreign law.  
5.8. Section 16 Matters. Assuming that Sears and Kmart deliver to Holdco the
Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably in advance of the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Holdco, or a committee of Non-

whom such information is to be made available. The phrases "herein,"
"hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and this Agreement shall
become effective when a counterpart signed by each party shall be delivered
to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the
same counterpart.   8.5. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to
herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality

in accordance with their terms and (b) except as provided in Sections 5.10

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, except that the NYBCL shall apply to the Sears
Merger.   8.7. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or
unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion
of the economic benefits of the Mergers that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as
is enforceable.   8.8. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned
by either party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   8.9. Submission to Jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, and (b) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each party agrees to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
hereto either in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York or, if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought
in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action
or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such party at
its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be
effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; provided
that nothing in this Section 8.9 shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The consent to
jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.9 shall not constitute a general
consent to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 8.9. The parties
agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law.   8.10. Enforcement. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their    62  specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
identified in the Section above, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   8.11. WAIVER OF JURY

PROCEEDING DIRECTLY INVOLVING ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT
