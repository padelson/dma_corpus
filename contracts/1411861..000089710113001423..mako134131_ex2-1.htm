 Set forth on _Schedule 4(m)_ is a complete and accurate list and description of all policies of fire, liability, product liability, workers compensation, health and other forms of insurance presently in effect with respect to the Product Business, true and correct copies of which have heretofore been made available to Buyer. _Schedule 4(m)_ includes, without limitation, the carrier, the description of coverage, the limits of coverage, retention or deductible amounts, amount of annual premiums, date of expiration and the date through which premiums have been paid with respect to each such policy, and any pending claims in excess of $10,000. All such policies are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies and provide insurance coverage for the properties, assets and operations of the Product Business, of the kinds, in the amounts and against the risks customarily maintained by organizations similarly situated; and to Sellers knowledge no such policy (nor any previous policy) provides for or is subject to any currently enforceable retroactive rate or premium adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events arising prior to the date hereof. _Schedule 4(m)_ indicates each policy as to which (i) the coverage limit has been reached, or (ii) the total incurred losses to date equal 75% or more of the coverage limit. No notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy, and Seller has no knowledge of any act or omission of Seller or any Subsidiary which could result in cancellation of any such policy prior to its scheduled expiration date. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has been refused any insurance with respect to any aspect of the operations of the Product Business nor has its coverage been limited by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for insurance or with which it has carried insurance during the last three years. Seller and each Subsidiary has duly and timely made all claims it has been entitled to make under each policy of insurance. Other than as set forth on _Schedule 4(m)_ , since January 1, 2008, all products liability and general liability policies maintained by or for the benefit of Seller or any Subsidiary have been "claims made" policies. There is no claim by Seller or any Subsidiary pending under any such policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies, and Seller has no knowledge of any basis for denial of any claim under any such policy. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier issuing any such policy that insurance rates therefor will hereafter be substantially increased (except to the extent that insurance rates may be increased for all similarly situated risks) or that there will hereafter be a cancellation or an increase in a deductible (or an increase in premiums in order to maintain an existing deductible) or nonrenewal of any such policy. Such policies are sufficient in all material respects for compliance by Seller and each Subsidiary with all requirements of Law and with the requirements of all material Contracts to which Seller or any Subsidiary is a party.

   (n) _Contracts and Commitments_.

  

 (i) _Real Property Leases_. Except for the real property leases set forth on _Schedule 1(a)(iv)_  (the " _Real Property Leases_ "), neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has any leases of real property.

 (iii) _Purchase Commitments_. Except for purchase commitments for titanium powder, neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has any purchase commitments for inventory items or supplies that, together with amounts on hand, constitute in excess of six months normal usage, or which are at a price materially greater than the price paid historically by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice.

Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Seller
nor any Subsidiary is a party to or is bound by any Contract requiring Seller
or any Subsidiary to assign any interest in any Purchased Asset, or
prohibiting or restricting Seller or any Subsidiary from competing in any
business or geographical area or soliciting customers or otherwise
restricting it from carrying on the Product Business anywhere in the world.

  

 (xii) _Other Material Contracts_. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has any Contract or commitment of any nature involving consideration or other expenditure in excess of $25,000, or involving performance over a period of more than six months, or which is otherwise individually material to the operations of the Product Business, except as explicitly described on _Schedule 4(n)(xii)_  or in any other Schedule.

  

 (xiii) _No Default_. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary is in default under any Contract or commitment, nor, to Sellers knowledge, has any event or omission occurred which through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or cause the acceleration of any of Sellers or any Subsidiarys obligations or result in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the Purchased Assets. No third party is in default under any Contract or commitment to which Seller or any Subsidiary is a party, nor, to Sellers knowledge, has any event or omission occurred which, through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or give rise to an automatic termination, or the right of discretionary termination, thereof.

 (viii) Seller will provide to Buyer the data possessed by Seller with respect to Sellers and each Subsidiarys basis in its assets (or groups of assets), which information is sufficient to allow Buyer to determine Sellers Tax basis in each of the Purchased Assets and to enable Buyer to satisfy its Tax reporting obligations under applicable Law. 

  

 (ix) The unpaid Taxes of Seller and each Subsidiary (A) did not, as of the date of the Recent Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Recent Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), and (B) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Seller in filing its Tax Returns.

No later than the Corporate Existence Date, Seller shall engage in one or more transactions treated as a liquidation of Seller within the meaning of Code Section 331.

 Except for the press release to be issued and the required Exchange Act filings by Buyer in connection with the execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise provided by Law, the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange or other regulator or governmental entity, the contents of this Agreement shall remain confidential, and neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may disclose the contents of this Agreement and the existence of the Agreement to the extent reasonably necessary (i) to obtain the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders of Seller and all third party consents, approvals, authorizations, exemptions, waivers and permits as listed on _Exhibit B_  hereto required for the transfer of the Purchased Assets from Seller to Buyer, and (ii) to the disclosing Partys officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, Affiliates, independent contractors or other persons over which it has control who are subject to confidentiality agreements.

 From the date hereof until the date that is three years following the Closing Date (the " _Insurance Maintenance Period_ "), Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall maintain, at its expense, the products liability insurance in effect with respect to the Product Business as of the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, at or prior to the Closing, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the provider of such products liability insurance the full amount of all premiums payable in respect of such products liability insurance during the Insurance Maintenance Period.

   (f) _Non-Competition of Seller and its Subsidiaries and Principals_.

  

 As an inducement to Buyer to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and to preserve the goodwill associated with the Purchased Assets, (i) for a period of five years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries and Principals (as defined below) and each of the respective Affiliates of Sellers Subsidiaries and Principals not to, directly or indirectly, replicate or duplicate, or develop, manufacture or sell, any products of the Product Business heretofore released or designed under the SAA (namely, cementless total hip system as described in 510(k) clearances K112802, K130353 and K131237, cemented primary cruciate retaining total knee as described in 510(k) clearance K123692 and FDA submission K132046 and cementless and cemented uni knee system designs as documented at the time of Closing), and (ii) for a period of three years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries and Principals and each of the respective Affiliates of Sellers Subsidiaries and Principals not to, directly or indirectly, develop, manufacture or sell any products within the Product Categories, as defined below, and, in the case of both _subclauses (i)_  and _(ii)_ , including, but not limited to, the commercialization of such joint reconstruction products and the development of intellectual property related to such joint reconstruction products. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions in both _subclauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , Seller and its Subsidiaries and Principals and their respective Affiliates may develop, manufacture or sell (A) total hip and total knee systems that are combined with bisphosphonate for purposes of a regulatory study only (IDE, CE or similar), (B) Novel Implants, as defined below, and (C) with respect only to the limitations set forth in _subclause (ii)_ above, the NEO total knee system, as described in 510(k) clearances K120313, K122500 and FDA submission K131368, for sale only in China and only in the non-Robotic Device Field of Use. Seller and its Subsidiaries and Principals and their respective Affiliates shall be permitted to utilize the PST design and manufacturing process Seller developed (but not any related trademarks, business identifiers, trade dress, service marks, trade names or brand names) to design and manufacture devices that do not violate the non-competition restrictions herein. For further clarity, the development, manufacture or sale of any of the following products shall not be deemed to violate the non-competition restrictions set forth in this _Section 7(f)_ : hip fracture devices, soft tissue washers/anchors, hip surface replacement systems, hip/knee revision systems, trauma devices and knee osteotomy devices. The geographic scope of this covenant not to compete shall extend worldwide. Buyer may sell, assign or otherwise transfer this covenant not to compete, in whole or in part, to any person or entity that purchases or assumes all or any portion of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. Recognizing the specialized nature of the Purchased Assets and the value of the covenants set forth in this _Section 7(f)_ as a material inducement to Buyer to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller acknowledges and agrees that the duration, geographic scope and activity restrictions of this covenant not to compete are reasonable. If, at the time of enforcement of any provision of this _Section 7(f)_ , a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable or unenforceable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree to the maximum period, scope, or geographical area reasonable or permissible under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. " _Product Categories_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2010 (and subsequently amended on October 21, 2011 and November 7, 2012) between Buyer and Seller (the " _SAA_ ") with the definitions further clarified to include cemented unicompartmental knee systems, total knee systems to be cemented and cementless primary cruciate retaining knee

   systems and the total hip system to be cementless primary total hip system. "
_Novel Implants_" shall mean implants produced only for use in the non-
Robotic Device Field of Use and only as devices with Enabling Technologies
(as hereinafter defined) for clinical evaluation in up to ten (10) U.S.
accounts and/or for sale outside the United States of America. " _Enabling
Technologies_" shall include, but not be limited to, imaging technologies,
device coatings and surface enhancements. " _Robotic Device_" shall have the
meaning set forth in the Rights Agreement (as defined herein). " _Principals_
," as used herein, means Alex Khowaylo, David S. Washburn, Robert C. Cohen
and Michael McCarthy. For the avoidance of doubt, the restriction set forth
in this Section 7(f) shall not apply to any shareholder of Seller other than
the Principals.

  

 (g) _Future Right of Buyer to License Novel Implants_.

  

 Following the Closing, the Parties agree to, at the sole option of Buyer, enter into good faith and commercially reasonable negotiations regarding a non-exclusive license agreement amongst the Parties with respect to the Novel Implants developed by Seller for use with a Robotic Device, with the timing and form of such negotiations to be within the good faith discretion of the Parties following Buyers decision to pursue such license agreement.

  

 (h) _Payroll Tax_.

  

 The Parties agree that, with respect to employees of Seller or its Affiliates who accept employment with Buyer as of the Closing Date, they respectively meet the definition of "predecessor" and "successor" as defined in Revenue Procedure 2004-53. For purposes of reporting employee remuneration to the IRS on Forms W-2, W-3 and 941 for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Seller and Buyer shall utilize the "Standard Procedure" described in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53. The Parties agree that, for purposes of reporting employee remuneration for Federal Insurance Contributions Act purposes for the calendar year within which the Closing Date occurs, Seller meets the definition of "predecessor" and Buyer meets the definition of "successor" as defined in the Treasury Regulations Section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). Seller shall supply Buyer, with respect to all the affected employees, all cumulative payroll information as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not assume any Liability with respect to such cumulative payroll information, and all such Liabilities shall be the sole responsibility of Seller. Seller shall pay all such Liabilities as and when due.

  

 (i) _Employment Matters_.

  

 Seller shall satisfy, or cause its insurance carriers to satisfy, all claims for benefits, whether insured or otherwise (including workers compensation, life insurance, medical and disability programs), under any Employee Plans/Agreements of Seller or any Subsidiary brought by, or in respect of, any Product Employee or any other current or former employee of Seller or any Subsidiary, which claims arise out of events occurring at, prior to or after the Closing, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Employee Plans/Agreements or applicable Laws without interruption as a result of the employment by Buyer of any such Product Employee. Seller or a Subsidiary shall maintain a health plan following the Closing Date, and Seller and such Subsidiary shall be responsible to provide COBRA continuation health 

   coverage to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries," as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 54.4980B-9 QandA - 4, as such regulations apply to the
transaction set forth in this Agreement for the maximum period required under
COBRA (without regard to any ability of Seller or such Subsidiary to
terminate COBRA coverage by terminating its group health plan). Seller also
shall be responsible, at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, to provide COBRA
continuation health coverage as to each Product Employee employed by Buyer
for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date such
Product Employee is eligible to receive health coverage from Buyer under
Buyers health plan.

  

 (j) _Consent to Employment_.

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates release, waive and discharge, and agree not to sue or otherwise pursue, any and all Claims, known or unknown, that Seller or any of its Affiliates may have against Buyer (or any of Buyers Affiliates) and/or any employee arising out of or relating to any such employees employment with Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates, including all Claims arising under any Contract containing any non-competition, confidentiality or similar provisions, except to the extent such Claims relate to events which transpired prior to the Closing or do not relate to the Product Business in any manner whatsoever.

  

 (k) _Reorganization_.

  

 (i) For a period of not less than three years following the Closing, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer will (A) continue to the historic business of Seller, or (B) use a significant portion of the Purchased Assets in a business (the provisions of _subclause (A)_ and _subclause (B)_ shall be applied in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d); provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 7(k)_  shall require Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to take any action or omit to take any action with respect to the Product Business or the Purchased Assets that Buyers Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, could be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Buyers shareholders under applicable Law.

  

 (ii) Buyer and Seller will each include a statement that complies with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a) with its federal income Tax Return for the year of the reorganization and will retain the information required to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(d).

  

 (iii) The Parties hereto intend the transactions described in _Sections 1 to 3_ of this Agreement to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(C) of the Code. However, Buyer makes no representations or warranties to Seller regarding the tax treatment of these transactions, whether these transactions will qualify as tax-free plans of reorganization under the Code, or any of the tax consequences to Seller, and Seller acknowledges that Seller is relying solely on its own tax advisors in connection with this Agreement.

  

 (l) _Tax Audit_.

  

 If an audit, investigation or similar proceeding with respect to Tax matters of Seller or any Subsidiary shall be commenced involving any taxing authority with respect to any 

   Tax matter that may affect the past, current or future Tax Liability of Buyer
( _e.g_., a potential change in adjusted tax basis of any Purchased Asset) (a
" _Tax Proceeding_ "), Seller shall provide Buyer with written notice of the
Tax Proceeding within ten days after its commencement; provided, however,
that the failure to provide written notice of the Tax Proceeding within such
10-day period shall not relieve Seller or any Subsidiary from its obligations
with respect to the subject of the Tax Proceeding. Buyer (or its legal and
accounting advisors) may fully participate, at Buyers sole expense, in the
Tax Proceeding. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary shall settle the Tax
Proceeding in a manner that could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect Buyer without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the commencement, status and nature
of the Tax Proceeding and, at the request of Buyer and without any further
consideration, shall provide or cause to be provided all assistance
reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to the conduct of the Tax
Proceeding. In the event the provisions of this _Section 7(l)_ and _Section
11(e)(iv)_ apply, then the provision of _Section 11(e)(iv)_ shall control.

  

 (m) _Payments to Former Employees of Seller_.

  

 As soon as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the Restricted Period, Seller shall make or cause to be made payments to those former employees of Seller who accept employment with Buyer on the Closing Date in the aggregate amount of not less than $1,370,000 and in such form as Seller shall determine, other than shares of Common Stock representing the Share Consideration, as identified on _Exhibit H_.

  

 (n) _Satisfaction of Certain Post-Closing Obligations of Seller_.

  

 From and after the Closing, Seller shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts payable by Seller and/or Pipeline Biotechnology, LLC under that certain License and Development Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2010, among J.D. Bobyn, OsteoAid Inc., Seller and Pipeline Biotechnology, LLC (together with all amendments thereto and any successor agreement or agreements, the " _OsteoAid Agreement_ ") in the manner and at such times as set forth in the OsteoAid Agreement, including, without limitation, all amounts payable to any person or entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with or as a result of a claim or determination that an "Exit Event" has occurred under the OsteoAid Agreement, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take such further action (in addition to satisfying all payment obligations described in _subclause (i)_ ) as is necessary to maintain in effect the OsteoAid Agreement so as not to adversely affect the rights of Buyer under the Rights Agreement.

  

 (o) _Shareholder Letters_.

  

 Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyer, not more than 30 days following the Closing, a Shareholder Letter from each shareholder of Seller, if any, who did not execute and deliver a Shareholder Letter prior to the Closing.

 Buyer agrees that, following the Closing until the earlier of (i) the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date if Seller has not taken material steps towards the completion of 

   its bisphosphonate IDE study prior to such date, or (ii) such time as Seller

IDE study, Buyer shall, at Sellers option, supply to Pipeline Biotechnology,
LLC, a subsidiary of Seller, (A) such implants at cost plus 30%, and (B) such
instrument devices at cost plus 10%, in each case, to the extent required by
Pipeline Biotechnology, LLC to execute such bisphosphonate IDE study.

  

 (q) _Buyer SEC Compliance_.

  

 Until the earlier of (i) the date on which any person or entity, through tender offer, merger or otherwise, acquires all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (ii) the 14-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall (A) make and keep available adequate current public information, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144(c)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, (B) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a timely manner all material reports and other documents required to be filed by Buyer under the Exchange Act, and (C) furnish to Seller (via notice of posting on EDGAR) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Buyer and such other reports and documents required to be filed by Buyer under the Exchange Act, in each case, promptly upon the reasonable request of Seller, whether such request is made on Sellers own behalf or on behalf of any shareholder of Seller.

  

 (r) _Non-Competition of Buyer_.

  

 Buyer acknowledges that Seller, through a wholly-owned subsidiary and pursuant to the Ketai Agreements, has granted Ketai exclusive rights to sell Sellers cementless total hip system (as described in _Section 7(f))_ in Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China for use only in non-Robotic Devices. Buyer agrees that, so long as the Ketai Agreements continue in effect, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, sell such cementless total hip system for use in non-Robotic Devices in Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China.

 The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will expire 18 months after the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "), except the following representations and warranties (collectively, the " _Specified Representations_ "): the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4(b), 4(c), 4(d), 4(e)(i), 4(f)(i), 4(z)(v), 5(b) and 5(c)_ , which representations and warranties shall survive forever, and the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4(u)_ , _Section 4(w)(i)_ and _Section 4(w)(iv)_ , which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation; provided, however, that delivery by one Party to the other of a written notice of breach of any representation or warranty, specifying the breach in reasonable detail to the extent then known, and making a claim with respect 

   thereto, on or prior to the Expiration Date will be deemed to preserve such
Partys claim after the Expiration Date with respect thereto until the final
resolution of such claim. The covenants required to be performed prior to
Closing shall survive the Closing and shall expire on the Expiration Date,
and the covenants required to be performed from and after the Closing will
survive the Closing until fully performed in accordance with their terms or
for the periods set forth in such covenants. All claims for actual fraud or
intentional misrepresentation shall survive the Closing hereunder until
barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

  

 (b) _Indemnification by Seller_.

  

 Seller hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its officers, employees, directors, agents and shareholders (" _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by Buyer resulting from, arising out of or due to (i) Sellers breach of any representations and warranties made by Seller under this Agreement, (ii) Sellers breach of any covenant or obligation of Seller under this Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Liabilities, (iv) Sellers ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing, (v) any matter set forth on _Exhibit P_ , or (vi) any past failure of Seller to provide to the Township of Hanover, New Jersey a complete and accurate site plan exemption application, including, but not limited to, hazardous substance and wastewater discharge information, and/or to obtain a certificate of occupancy from the Township of Hanover, New Jersey for continuing operations at the Ridgedale Facility (collectively, the " _Hanover Matters_ ").

  

 (c) _Indemnification by Buyer_.

  

 Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its respective officers, employees, directors, agents and shareholders (" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses, suffered, incurred or sustained by Seller resulting from, arising out of or due to (i) Buyers breach of any representations and warranties, (ii) Buyers breach of any covenant or obligation of Buyer under this Agreement, or (iii) Buyers assumption of the Assumed Liabilities from and after the Closing Date.

  

 (d) _Definition of Loss_.

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Loss_ " means any and all Liabilities, obligations, judgments, injunctions, charges, orders, decrees, rulings, damages, dues, fines, penalties, assessments, Taxes, deficiencies, amounts paid in settlement, losses and expenses (including interest, court costs, disbursements, reasonable fees of attorneys (including reasonable and demonstrable allocated costs of in-house counsel), accountants and other experts or other reasonable expenses of any litigation or other proceedings or of any claim, default or assessment), arising out of any claim, complaint, demand, cause of action, action, suit or other proceeding asserted or initiated or otherwise existing in respect of any matter, known or unknown.

  

 (e) _ Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

 (i) _Seller s Limitations_. Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to claims for Losses pursuant to _Section 11(b)(i)_ hereof until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section_

   _11(b)(i)_ hereof equals or exceeds $250,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which
event Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to _Section 11(b)(i)_ hereof for all Losses in excess of the Basket. Buyer
Indemnified Parties may not recover indemnification under _Section 11(b)(i)_
hereof in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

  

 (ii) _Buyer Limitations_. Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to claims for Losses pursuant to _Section 11(c)(i)_  hereof until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties under _Section 11(c)(i)_ hereof equals or exceeds the Basket, in which event Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 11(c)(i)_ hereof for all Losses (not just Losses in excess of the of the Basket). Seller Indemnified Parties may not recover indemnification under _Section 11(c)(i)_ hereof in an aggregate amount in excess of the Cap.

  

 (iii) Payments by an indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 11(b)_ or _Section 11(c)_ in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any Liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the indemnified Party in respect of any such claim. The indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses. If the indemnified Party does not recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any indemnified Loss until after the date of payment of indemnification hereunder with respect to such Loss, then the initial payment of indemnification shall not be reduced by such subsequent recovery, but the indemnified Party shall subsequently rebate to the indemnifying Party the amount of such recovery equal to the amount such Loss to which such recovery relates actually indemnified by the indemnifying Party (after giving effect to the limitations set forth in _Section 11(e)_ ); provided, however, that with respect to any indemnified Loss, an indemnified Party shall not be required to rebate an amount in excess of the amount of its subsequent recovery related to such Loss or in excess of the amount of such Loss actually indemnified by the indemnifying Party.

  

 (iv) Each indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto; provided, however, that an indemnified Party shall not be required to incur any costs to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss or otherwise mitigate such Loss.

  

 (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Basket or Cap be deemed to apply to (A) breaches of the Specified Representations, (B) breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4(u)(i)_ , _Section 4(w)(i)_ and _Section 4(w)(iv)_ , (C) Buyers or Sellers covenants contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sellers covenants in _Section 7(n)_ , (D) Buyers obligations with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, (E) the Excluded Liabilities, (F) any matter set forth on _Exhibit P_ , (G) any of the Hanover Matters, or (H) any claim for actual fraud.

   (f) _Notice of Claim; Indemnification Procedures Relating to Third Party Claims_.

  

 (i) Either Party shall give to the other Party prompt written notice of any claim or event (including, but not limited to, the commencement of any Tax audit with regard to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date) which the notifying Party believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of an indemnified Party to give such prompt written notice shall not affect the Liability of the indemnifying Party hereunder except to the extent that the rights of the indemnifying Party to defend itself or to cure or mitigate Losses are actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the indemnified Party shall furnish to the indemnifying Party, in reasonable detail, such information as it may have with respect to any such claim or other event, including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served upon it or any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same.

  

 (ii) The indemnifying Party will have the right, within 15 days after being so notified in accordance with _Section 11(f)(i)_ hereof (the " _Notice Period_ "), to assume the defense of any Party claim, litigation or proceeding asserted by a third party (a " _Claim_ ") with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Party. If notice is given to an indemnifying Party of the commencement of a Claim in accordance with this Agreement and the indemnifying Party does not, within the Notice Period, give notice to the indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control the defense of such Claim without the indemnifying Partys consent; provided, however, that the indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In any Claim, the defense of which the indemnifying Party has assumed, the indemnified Party will have the right to participate therein and retain its own counsel at its own expense, unless representation of such Parties by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of the indemnified Partys counsel, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them, and in such case such separate counsel may be retained by the indemnified Party at the expense of the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party may elect to settle any Claim defended by it without the written consent of the indemnified Party; provided, however, that such settlement is limited to payment of monetary damages that are payable in full by the indemnifying Party and the indemnified Party is fully discharged at the time of settlement from any Liabilities with respect to the Claim and such settlement will not have an adverse effect on the indemnified Party. The indemnifying Party may not enter into any settlement that is not limited to payment of monetary damages without the indemnified Partys prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that an action may materially and adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages, such indemnified Party may, by notice to the indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such action with counsel of the indemnified Partys selection, but the indemnifying Party shall have no Liability with respect to a compromise or settlement thereof entered into without its consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

   (g) _Exclusive Remedy_.

  

 Other than with respect to fraud, intentional misrepresentation or illegal activity, and other than as set forth in _Section 13(c)_ , the indemnification provided in this _Article 11_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer and Seller with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller or Buyer, respectively, in this Agreement.

  

 12. _Termination_.

  

 (a) _Reasons for Termination_.

  

 This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing:

  

 (i) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller; or

  

 (ii) by Buyer, provided Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement, in accordance with _Section 12(b)_ hereof, in the event the Closing shall not have occurred on or before October 11, 2013 (the " _Termination Date_ ") and the inability to close the transactions contemplated hereunder by such date is due solely to Sellers failure to satisfy one or more of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that as long as Seller is engaged in good faith negotiations to obtain one or more of the third party consents listed on _Exhibit B_ , the Termination Date shall be extended until no later than October 31, 2013; or

  

 (iii) by Seller, provided Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement, in accordance with _Section 12(b)_ hereof, in the event the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date and the inability to close the transactions contemplated hereunder by such date is due solely to Buyers failure to satisfy one or more of its obligations hereunder, provided, however, that Seller may extend the Termination Date until no later than October 31, 2013; or

  

 (iv) by Buyer or Seller, in accordance with _Section 12(b)_  hereof, if any governmental entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any final, nonappealable order or any Law, or refused to grant any required consent or approval, that has the effect of making the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or that otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions hereby; or

  

 (v) by Buyer, provided Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement, in accordance with _Section 12(b)_ hereof, if there has been a material violation or breach by Seller of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of this Agreement that has not been waived in writing by Buyer; or

  

 (vi) by Seller, provided Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement, in accordance with _Section 12(b)_ hereof, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of this Agreement that has not been waived in writing by Seller.

   (b) _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

  

 (i) In the event Seller or Buyer desires to terminate this Agreement as provided in _Sections 12(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi)_ , the terminating Party shall provide written notice thereof to the other Party as promptly as possible specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and the Party receiving notice of such termination shall have 30 days from such notice to cure the breach, failure or violation set forth in such notice of termination. If such breach, failure or violation is not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of, or waived by the terminating Party, then this Agreement shall immediately and automatically (without any further action required by the Parties) become null and void.

  

 (ii) Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12_ shall not in any way affect the rights of any Party against any other Party that has violated, breached or failed to satisfy any of the representations, warranties or covenants of this Agreement prior to the termination hereof. If Buyer is the breaching Party, then Buyer shall indemnify Seller for all Losses arising out of such breach. If Seller is the breaching Party, then Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives for all Losses arising out of such breach.

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12_ , (A) the duties, rights and obligations of the Parties set forth under _Section 7(d)_ and _Section 13_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (B) pursuant to Section 1(qq) of the Second Amendment to Strategic Alliance Agreement, dated as November 7, 2012, between Seller and Buyer, the Down Payment shall not be forfeited by Buyer, but shall be applied as a credit towards the purchase price to be paid for the Product Business in the event that Buyer or any Affiliate, successor or permitted assignee of Buyer at any time following the termination of this Agreement purchases the Product Business from Pipeline, or any Affiliate, successor or permitted assignee of Pipeline.

  

 13. _General Provisions_.

  

 (a) _Expenses_.

  

 (i) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated and except as set forth in _Section 13(a)(ii)_ , each Party hereto shall bear all of its own expenses, including its own legal, accounting, investment banking and advisory fees and expenses associated with the negotiation of the Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (ii) Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for and each shall pay 50% of all amounts relating to the cost of all filing fees and other costs relating to the transfer of the Purchased Assets to Buyer. Buyer shall, however, have no obligation to incur any Liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any person or entity in connection with any third party consents and approvals required to transfer the Purchased Assets to Buyer.

   (b) _Termination of SAA_.

  

 Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, effective immediately upon the Closing, the SAA, including all rights and obligations of Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates thereunder, shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.

  

 (c) _Specific Performance_.

  

 Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to the obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each non-breaching Party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties hereto, in addition to any relief at Law that may be available and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i) will waive, in any action for specific performance, any and all defenses to the remedy of specific performance, including the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law, (ii) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity, to specific performance of this Agreement without the need to post a bond, and (iii) will not object, or raise any procedural defenses, to the entry by summary procedure of any court order, including a mandatory injunction that requires specific performance of any or all obligations under this Agreement.
