hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ (except for any
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but
subject to the satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing Date or waiver
by the Party entitled to waive such conditions); _provided_ , _however_ , the

Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing
Date or waiver by the Party entitled to waive such conditions), Merger Sub
and the Company shall each, substantially simultaneously and in coordination

_Merger Notice_ ") informing the Companies Registrar that all such conditions
to the Merger have been met (except for any conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of
such conditions on the Closing Date or waiver by the Party entitled to waive
such conditions) and requesting that the Companies Registrar issue a
certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(ii) each Company Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.03(a)(i)_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive, subject
to the other provisions of this _Article 2_ (A) 1.272 (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock
Consideration_ "), and (B) $8.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ");

  



  

(iii) each holder of a Company Ordinary Share converted into the right to

changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares, or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any items on which the
calculation of the Merger Consideration depends, as the case may be, shall be
correspondingly adjusted as appropriate to provide the holders of Company
Ordinary Shares (including the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs)
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

Section 2.06 _Exchange of Company Ordinary Shares_. Parent shall enter into a

Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Ordinary Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_ through the Exchange Agent,
subject to _Section 2.06(a)(ii)_ , an aggregate number of duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and registered shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form
comprising the number of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)(ii)(A)_. In addition, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time
after the Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which the
holders of Company Ordinary Shares may be entitled pursuant to _Section
2.06(b)_ (such Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with
the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 2.03_ (including
as a result of any losses resulting from the investments contemplated in
_Section 2.06(g)_ ), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, with the
Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency. The Exchange
Agent shall deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant
to _Section 2.03_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in _Section
2.06(a)(i)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to
_Section 2.03(a)(ii)(B)_ , _Section 2.06(b)_ or _Section 2.08_.

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i)  _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose Company Ordinary Shares were converted into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03_ (other than Company 102
Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
customary form and be reasonably acceptable to the Company), (ii) a
declaration in which the beneficial owner of Company Ordinary Shares provides
certain information necessary for Parent to determine whether any amounts
need to be withheld from the Merger Consideration payable to such
beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case,
subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.06_ and _Section 2.10_ ), the
Code, or any applicable provision of any Law, and (iii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with a letter of transmittal and the declaration for Tax
withholding purposes and/or a Valid Tax Certificate, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to as promptly as practicable, (A) in
the case of the Stock Consideration, credit in the stock ledger and other
appropriate books and records of Parent the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock into which the shares of Company Ordinary Shares represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) in the
case of the Cash Consideration, pay, by delivery of a check or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the amount, in United States
dollars, of the aggregate Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)(i)_ , and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled; _provided_ , that any number of
shares of Parent Common Stock so paid and delivered as part of such Merger
Consideration shall be in book-entry form. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of a Company Ordinary Share that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



    

 | -22-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the applicable form of Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article 2_ , but shall be
required to deliver an "agent's message" (which shall be in customary form
and be reasonably acceptable to the Company) regarding the book-entry
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of such
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and a declaration in
which the beneficial owner of Company Ordinary Shares provides certain
information necessary for Parent to determine whether any amounts need to be
withheld from the Merger Consideration payable to such beneficial owner
pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case, subject to the
provisions of this _Section 2.06_ and _Section 2.10_ ), the Code, or any
applicable provision of any Law. Upon proper delivery of an "agent's message"
and the declaration for Tax withholding purposes and/or a Valid Tax
Certificate, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry
Shares whose Company Ordinary Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03_ shall be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, (A) in the case of the Stock Consideration, credit in the
stock ledger and other appropriate books and records of Parent the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) in the case of the Cash
Consideration, pay and deliver a check in the amount of the aggregate Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)(ii)_ , and the Book-Entry Shares of such
holder shall forthwith be cancelled; _provided_ , that any number of shares
of Parent Common Stock so paid and delivered as part of such Merger
Consideration shall be in book-entry form.

  



  

  

  

(iii)  _Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (A) all holders of
Certificates and all holders of Book Entry Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of the Company and (B) the share transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all Company Ordinary Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
Company Ordinary Shares shall be made on such share transfer books after the
Effective Time other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

   

 | -23-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv)  _Company 102 Shares and Company Ordinary Shares subject to the 104H Tax
Ruling_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) any
Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)(i)_ ) payable in respect of Company 102 Shares
shall be transferred by the Exchange Agent on the Closing Date to the 102
Trustee for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof and shall be
released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders of such Company 102
Shares, in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance
and the Option Tax Ruling, and (B) any Merger Consideration (and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)(i)_ )
payable in respect of Company Ordinary Shares subject to the 104H Tax Ruling
shall be transferred by the Exchange Agent on the Closing Date to a trustee
appointed and approved under the 104H Tax Ruling, to the extent required by
the 104H Tax Ruling for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof, and
shall be held and released (or otherwise treated) by said trustee to the
beneficial holders of such Company Ordinary Shares in accordance with the
requirements of the 104H Tax Ruling.

  



  

(b)  _Distributions with Respect to Un-exchanged Shares_.

  



  

(i)  _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Ordinary
Shares, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
_Article 2_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Company Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificates in accordance with
this _Article 2_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, subject to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ there shall be paid to the holder
of the Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A)
at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ , the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ , and a payment date
subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ , payable with respect to such Parent Common
Stock.

  



    

 | -24-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law and this _Section
2.06(b)(ii)_ , there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange for Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article 2_ ,
without interest, (A) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(ii)_ , the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Stock and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery
by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(ii)_ , and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.06(a)(ii)_ , payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article 2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Ordinary
Shares (other than the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with _Section 2.06(b)_ ). After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of Company Ordinary Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing Company Ordinary Shares are presented to
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Ordinary Shares for six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Ordinary Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment
of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.06(b)_.

  



  

(e) None of Parent, Infiniti, Holdco, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Ordinary
Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit and indemnification, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered as provided in this _Article 2_.

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent _; provided_ , _however_ , no such investment income or
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Ordinary Shares pursuant to _Section 2.03_. Any interest, gains and other
income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent payable to or at the direction of Parent upon
its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall
accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Ordinary Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Ordinary Shares pursuant to this _Article 2_.

  



  

Section 2.07 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Company shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Company or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Company Share-Based Plans_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 2.08(f)_ below, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
award of options to purchase Company Ordinary Shares (a " _Company Option_ ")
that is outstanding but unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and substituted with option(s) to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock to be granted under the Infiniti 2018 Plan (each, a "
_Substituted Option_ "), (i) representing the right to purchase that number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of
Company Ordinary Shares underlying such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio and
(2) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing the
Cash Consideration by the Infiniti Closing Price (such sum, the " _Equity
Award Exchange Ratio_ "), with any fractional shares rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) with a per-
share exercise price of such Substituted Option equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per Company Ordinary Share subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each
Substituted Option shall have the same material terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including all time-based vesting conditions and expiration
date (but subject to any conflicting provisions in the Infiniti 2018 Plan).
To the extent applicable to each grantee, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock underlying any such Substituted Option, the exercise price, and
the other terms and conditions of any such Substituted Option will be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code and/or under Section 102(b)(2) and Section 102(b)(3) of the
Ordinance.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.08(a)_ to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each Company Option that is outstanding and vested in
accordance with its terms immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Vested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (I) the Merger Consideration
(allocated between the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration in the
same proportion as in _Section 2.03(a)(ii)_ ), over (II) the exercise price
per Company Ordinary Share subject to such Vested Company Option multiplied
by (y) the total number of Company Ordinary Shares underlying such Vested
Company Option (the " _Closing Option Consideration_ "). The Closing Option
Consideration payable for Vested Company Options which also qualify as
Company 102 Awards shall be treated as Company 102 Shares, and as such shall
be transferred by the Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time
to the 102 Trustee for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof and shall
be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holder of such Vested Company
Option, in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance
and the Option Tax Ruling, and subject to the execution by such holder of a
waiver and acknowledgement letter in a customary form acceptable to Parent
and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise price of the
applicable Company Option is equal to or greater than the Closing Option
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any payment
being made in respect thereof.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 2.08(f)_ below, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
Company RSU award that is outstanding but unvested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and substituted with restricted share
units to be granted under the Infiniti 2018 Plan (each, a " _Substituted RSU_
") representing the right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Ordinary Shares
underlying such Company RSU award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the nearest lower whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock. Each Substituted RSU shall have the same material terms
and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including all vesting conditions (but subject to any
conflicting provisions in the Infiniti 2018 Plan) and/or the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and/or Section 102(b)(2) and Section 102(b)(3) of the
Ordinance.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.08(c)_ to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each Company RSU that is vested in accordance with its
terms immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Vested Company RSU_
") shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Merger Consideration payable for Vested Company RSUs which
also qualify as Company 102 Awards shall be treated as Company 102 Shares,
and as such be transferred by the Exchange Agent immediately following the
Effective Time to the 102 Trustee for the benefit of the beneficial owners
thereof and shall be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders of
such Vested Company RSU, in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of
the Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, and subject to the execution by such
holder of a waiver and acknowledgement letter in a customary form acceptable
to Parent and the Company.

  



    

 | -27-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(e) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option or Company
RSU or any participant in a Company Plan or other employee benefit
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any employment
agreement, shall have any right hereunder to acquire any share capital or
other equity interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) in the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or
appropriate action (including obtaining any required consents) to effectuate
the substitution of the Company Options and Company RSU awards by Parent in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.08_ and the assignment to Parent
of the authorities and responsibilities of the Company Board or any committee
thereof under the applicable Company Plans that govern such Company Options
and Company RSU awards. The substitution of the unvested Company 102 Awards
shall be effectuated in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of the
Ordinance and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained. The substitution of the
Company Awards subject to Section 3(i) of the Ordinance shall be effectuated
in accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance and the Option Tax
Ruling, if obtained.

  



  

Section 2.09 _Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Withholding Tax_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, the
Surviving Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the 102 Trustee or the Exchange
Agent (each, a " _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable under, or in connection with, this Agreement to any former
holder of Company Ordinary Shares or Company Awards (for the avoidance
of doubt, including Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs) (each, a
" _Payee_ ") pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law; provided,
however, that with respect to withholding of Israeli Tax, in the event any
Payee provides a Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate issued by the ITA
regarding the withholding (or exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from
the consideration payable in respect thereof in accordance with this _Section
2.10_ , then the deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance
or any other provision of Israeli Law or requirement shall be made only
in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate. Any amount
deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.10 _ and paid over to the
relevant taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the Payee in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or
shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the
appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Agent will be authorized to sell on
the open market any amount of shares of Parent Common Stock required to cover
any amount required to be deducted or withheld under this _Section 2.10_.

  



    

 | -28-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.10(a)_ above, with respect
to Taxes required to be withheld under Israeli Law, the consideration payable
to each Payee shall be retained by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of each
such Payee for a period of up to 180 days following the Closing (the "
_Withholding Drop Date_ "), during which time no Payor shall make any
payments to such Payee or withhold any amounts for Taxes due under Israeli Law
from the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided
below and during which time each Payee may obtain a Valid Tax Certificate. If
a Payee delivers, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Withholding Drop Date, a Valid Tax Certificate to Payor, then the
deduction and withholding of any Taxes due under Israeli Law shall be made
only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate and the
balance of the payment that is not withheld shall be paid to such Payee
subject to any non-Israeli withholding which is applicable to the payment (if
any). If any Payee (i) does not provide Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate, by
no later than five (5) Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date, or
(ii) submits a written request with Payor to release its portion of the
consideration prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Valid
Tax Certificate at or before such time, then the amount to be withheld from
such Payee's portion of the consideration shall be calculated according to the
applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by Parent in accordance
with applicable Law (increased by interest plus linkage differences, as
defined in Section 159A of the Ordinance, for the period between the fifteenth
(15th) day of the calendar month following the month during which the Closing
occurs and the time the relevant payment is made, and calculated in NIS
based on a USD-NIS exchange rate not lower than the effective exchange rate
at the Closing Date).

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file
with the ITA an application for a ruling, in a form provided to Parent prior
to the date hereof and acceptable to Parent, (i) with respect to holders of
Company Ordinary Shares that are non-Israeli residents (as defined in the
Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA), (A) exempting the applicable
Payor from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including the
Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation exists, or (B)
instructing such Payor how such withholding is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates
of withholding to be applied and how to identify any such non-Israeli
residents; and (ii) with respect to holders of Company Ordinary Shares (other
than Company 102 Shares or Company Ordinary Shares subject to the 104H Tax
Ruling) that are Israeli residents (as defined in the Ordinance or as will be
determined by the ITA) (x) exempting the applicable Payor from any obligation
to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation exists, or (y)
instructing such Payor how such withholding is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders of the
Company Ordinary Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate
or rates of withholding to be applied; and (iii) with respect to non-Israeli
resident holders of Company Awards or Company Ordinary Shares who were
granted such securities as awards in consideration for work or services, (x)
exempting the applicable Payor from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such
obligation exists, or (y) instructing such Payor how such withholding is to
be executed (the " _Withholding Tax Ruling_ ").

  



    

 | -29-|

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, the Company will cause its Israeli
counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an
application for a ruling, in a form provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof and acceptable to Parent, permitting any holders of the Company
Ordinary Shares that are not otherwise exempt from Israeli tax with respect
to the Merger Consideration to defer any applicable Israeli Tax with respect
to the Stock Consideration that such Payee will receive pursuant to this
Agreement until the sale, transfer or other conveyance for cash of such Stock
Consideration by such Payee or such other date set forth in Section 104H of
the Ordinance (the " _104H Tax Ruling_ "). If the 104H Tax Ruling is not
granted prior to the Closing or in accordance with the instructions of
the ITA, the Company shall take all necessary action to obtain an interim tax
ruling prior to the Closing, confirming, among other things, that Payor shall
be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any payments made with
respect to Company Ordinary Shares listed in such interim tax ruling to the
Exchange Agent or the trustee designated in such interim tax ruling in
connection with the Merger (the " _Interim 104H Tax Ruling_ "). If prior to
the Closing an Interim 104H Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all
references herein to the 104H Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such
Interim 104H Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive 104H Tax
Ruling is obtained.

  



  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall instruct its Israeli
counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an
application for a ruling, in a form provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof and acceptable to Parent, confirming that the treatment of the Company
102 Awards in accordance with _Section 2.08_ and exchange of the Company 102
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.06_ shall not be regarded as a violation
of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in Section 102 of
the Ordinance) so long as the consideration for such securities is deposited
with the 102 Trustee until the end of the respective holding period
(which ruling may be subject to customary conditions regularly associated
with such a ruling) (the " _Option Tax Ruling_ "). The Company shall include
in any request for the Option Tax Ruling a request to exempt any Payor and its
respective agents from any withholding obligation in relation to any payments
made with respect to any Company 102 Awards or Company 102 Shares. If
the Option Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the Closing or in accordance
with the instructions of the ITA, the Company shall take all necessary action
to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among other
things, that Payor shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation
to any payments made with respect to any Company 102 Awards or Company 102
Shares to the Exchange Agent or the 102 Trustee in connection with the Merger
(the " _Interim Option Tax Ruling_ "). If prior to the Closing an Interim
Option Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all references herein to the
Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such Interim Option Tax Ruling,
until such time that a final definitive Option Tax Ruling is obtained.

(f) Without limiting the generality of this _Section 2.10_ , each of the
Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and
accountants to coordinate all material activities and to cooperate with each
other with respect to the preparation and filing of such applications and in
the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Option Tax Ruling (including the Interim
Option Tax Ruling) the Withholding Tax Ruling and the 104H Tax Ruling
(including any interim ruling or approvals related thereto). In any event,
the final text of the Option Tax Ruling, the Withholding Tax Ruling and the
104H Tax Ruling (and any other interim rulings or approvals related thereto)
shall be subject to the prior written confirmation of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) of its receipt of any notice or information in
connection with any of the above rulings or approvals.

  



  

(g) Subject to _Section 7.13_ , each party hereto is relying solely on the
advice of his, her or its own Tax advisors with respect to the Tax
consequences of the Merger.

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 16,000,000

reported within the periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including
controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure of such information in
the Company's periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act.

provide or cause to be provided to Holdco and the Company debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the Transactions
and related fees and expenses and the other purposes set forth therein (the "

Financing Commitment and the Investment Agreement. No event has

Infiniti and the Company at the Effective Time, will be sufficient to pay the

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) that the Company is solvent immediately

results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, and after
giving effect to the Transactions, including the Financing, any alternative
financing and the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration, the Surviving
Company will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person means that, as of any date
of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets
of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities
of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date,
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person
on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date, and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

Infiniti Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, cause its Subsidiaries to and shall request that its
Representatives, immediately cease (i) any communications, discussions or
negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnishing to any Person (other than Parent,
Infiniti, Holdco, Merger Sub, their respective Representatives and the
Company's Representatives) any information with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) cooperating with, assisting in, participating
in, knowingly facilitating or encouraging a Company Acquisition Proposal and,
if applicable, shall request to have returned to the Company or destroyed any
confidential information that has been provided to any Person during any such
communications, discussions or negotiations occurring in the six (6) months
prior to the date hereof. From and after the date hereof until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 9_ , the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries or authorize or knowingly permit any of its
Representatives to (and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such
Persons not to), directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information which has not been
previously publicly disseminated) or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the
making or submission of any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or
offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) subject to _Section 5.02(b)_ , approve,
recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (C) subject to _Section 5.02(b)_ , approve, recommend, publicly
propose to approve or recommend or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding, in each case relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement) or a
Company Superior Proposal (each an " _Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "), (D) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (E)
agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , if, prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, following the receipt of a bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Superior Proposal and that was not solicited in violation of this
_Section 5.02(a)_ and was made after the date hereof, the Company may, in
response to such Company Acquisition Proposal and subject to compliance with
_Section 5.02(b)_ , furnish information with respect to the Company to the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that (1) prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any
such nonpublic information relating to the Company to such Person, the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement_
") that (x) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company
from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to Parent
required pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ and (y) contains provisions that in
the aggregate are no less restrictive on such Person than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (provided that such agreement does not need to contain any
provision prohibiting (including any direct or indirect "standstill" or
similar provisions that prohibit) the making of any Company Acquisition
Proposal), and (2) promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) following
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives).

  



    

 | -72-| 
---|---|--- 

 



     

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (and only if): (I) a written Company
Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of _Section 5.02(a)_
is made to the Company by a Third Party and such Company Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn; (II) the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal; and (III) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under the circumstances and applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , none of the Company, the Company Board or any
committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
authorize the Company to enter into any Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement unless:

  



  

(i) the Company Board provides Parent at least five (5) days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (it being understood that the
delivery of such notice and any amendment or update thereto and the
determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment shall not, by
itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice
shall specify in detail the reasons therefor and shall include the
information with respect to the Company Superior Proposal that is
specified in _Section 5.02(c)_ , as well as a copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and any related Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement;

  



  

(ii) during the five (5) days following such written notice described in the
foregoing clause (i) (or such shorter period as is specified in this _Section
5.02_ below), the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in
good faith with Parent (unless Parent has expressly agreed in writing not to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that may, at
Parent's sole discretion, be proposed by Parent in response to such Company
Superior Proposal (it being understood that any modification to the financial
or other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall result in a
new five (5) day period under this  _Section 5.02(b)(ii)_ ); and

  



  

(iii) at the end of the five (5) day period described in the foregoing clause
(i) (or such shorter period as specified in this _Section 5.02_ below), the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed), that the
Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal and
the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
Company under the circumstances and applicable Law.

  



  

Any amendment or modification to the conditionality, price or form of
consideration of any Company Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.02_ , and the
Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of occurrence)
notify Parent of any such new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Parties
shall comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.02_ with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the "matching period" set forth above shall in
such circumstance expire on the later of three (3) days after the Company
Board provides written notice of such new Company Acquisition Proposal to
Parent and the end of the original five (5) day period described in clause
(ii) above;  _provided_ , _further_ , (x) whether or not there is a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.01_ , the Company Board shall submit this Agreement
for approval by the Company shareholders at the Company Shareholders' Meeting
(provided, however that, for so long as there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall nevertheless be required in
such case to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the Transactions); and (y) in the event there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section 5.02_ with
respect to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01(f)_.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.02(a)_ and _Section 5.02(b)_ , the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing (i) of any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal that are received by,
or any non-public information with regard to such Company Acquisition
Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to
be initiated regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal with, the Company
(or any of its Representatives), indicating, in connection with such notice,
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the inquiry, proposal
or offer and the material terms and conditions of any such inquiries,
proposals or offers (and providing copies of all related written inquiries,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and (ii) of the
Company's intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal, information request or inquiry. In no event shall the
Company begin providing any such information or engage in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing Parent with the notice required by the
preceding sentence. The Company thereafter shall (x) keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any event, within 24
hours) of the status of any material discussions or negotiations with respect
to any such inquiries, proposal or offers and the details of any material
changes to the status and material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or
offers (including any material amendments thereto or any change to the scope
or material terms or conditions thereof, and including copies of any written
inquiries, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements and material
modifications thereto) and (y) substantially concurrently with the
delivery to any such Person, provide to Parent any information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such
Person or its Representatives unless such information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent.

  



  

Section 5.03 _Disclosure Documents_. None of the documents required to be
filed by the Company with the SEC after the date hereof in connection with
the Transactions will, on the date of such filing, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 5.03_ , the Company hereby covenants and agrees that
none of the information supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) a registration statement on
Form S-4 (or similar successor form) to register the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger (including any amendments or
supplements, the " _Registration Statement_ ") will, at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act (or, with
respect to any post-effective amendment or supplement, at the time such post-
effective amendment or supplement becomes effective), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or (b) the definitive Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus included in the
Registration Statement at the time it becomes effective to be sent to the
Company's shareholders in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions and Infiniti's stockholders in connection with the Transactions
(including any amendments or supplements, the " _Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ ") will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.03, no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to information or statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus which were not supplied by or on behalf of the Company.

Section 5.04 _Company Shareholders ' Meeting_. The Company shall duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholders ' Meeting_") as promptly as practicable after the date
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act
(except as provided in this _Section 5.04_ ) for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance
with applicable Law. In connection with the Company Shareholders' Meeting,
the Company shall (i) subject to _Section 5.02(b)_ , recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the Company's shareholders
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Subject to _Section 5.02(b)_ ,
regardless of whether there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of (it being understood that a proxy card will
be deemed "in favor of" a matter to be acted upon by the Company's
shareholders if it provides the shareholder with the ability to either vote
for, vote against or abstain from voting on such matter) the adoption of this
Agreement and take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to
secure the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by
the Company's shareholders, provided that nothing in this _Section 5.04_
shall prohibit the Company Board or any committee thereof from making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with this Agreement. The
Company shall keep Parent, Infiniti, Holdco and Merger Sub reasonably updated
with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent,
Infiniti, Holdco or Merger Sub, and shall direct its proxy soliciting agent
to provide Parent and its Representatives with the results of all proxy
tabulations provided by such proxy soliciting agent to the Company. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or
postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Company shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders'
Meeting: (i) after consultation with Parent, for not more than two (2) periods
not to exceed ten (10) Business Days each if on the date on which the Company
Shareholders' Meeting is then scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Ordinary Shares to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval; (ii) if on the date on which the Company
Shareholders' Meeting is then scheduled, there are insufficient Company
Ordinary Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders' Meeting;
or (iii) after consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or
postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting would reasonably be expected to be
a violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment
or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be timely provided
to the holders of Company Ordinary Shares. Once the Company has established a
record date for the Company Shareholders' Meeting, the Company shall not
change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company
Shareholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company's organizational documents. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Transactions (including the Merger) shall be the only matters (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by
the Company's shareholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the Transactions) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders' Meeting. Regardless
of whether there is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
Shareholders' Meeting shall be held in accordance with the terms hereof unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 9_.

at or prior to the Closing (the " _Loan Documents_ "), which Loan Documents
are set forth on _Section 5.06_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii)
the termination of the Loan Documents, (iii) the release of all Liens held
pursuant to or otherwise related to the Loan Documents, and (iv) such other
matters as Parent may reasonably request; unless, in all cases, the
counterparty to any such Contract provides a written unconditional waiver to
the Company, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of any and all
liabilities and obligations that the Company might have in connection with or
as a result of this Agreement or the Transactions, including, without
limitation, acceleration of any such liabilities and obligations. The
principal amount of the Debt Financing less such portion of the
Debt Financing to be used to pay the Cash Consideration shall be at least
equal to the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan Documents
as of the date hereof and shall be used to fulfill Porsche's undertaking under
this _Section 5.06_.

Section 6.02 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) At and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each past and present director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs,
executors or administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Company Indemnified Party), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
arising out of (i) actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) to the extent they are based on or arise out of or
pertain to the Transactions, including the Merger, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred
in enforcing such person's rights under this _Section 6.02_ ; ( _provided_
such Company Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to
which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, non-
appealable judgment such Company Indemnified Party is not ultimately
entitled), in each case to the same extent that the Company or its
Subsidiaries would have been required to do so pursuant to the
Company's organizational documents and indemnification agreements (to the
extent such agreements have been made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Company Indemnified Party notifies
the Surviving Company on or prior to the seventh anniversary of the Effective
Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ , the provisions of this _Section 6.02_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.02(a)_ , for seven years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, (i) except to the extent such agreement provides for an earlier
termination, cause to be maintained in effect the provisions regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses in any
agreements (other than insurance Contracts) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with any Company Indemnified Party that are in existence on the
date hereof, to the extent such agreements have been made available to Parent
prior to the date hereof, and (ii) not amend, modify or repeal such
provisions in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the
rights or protections thereunder of any such Company Indemnified Party in
respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, in consultation with Parent as provided in
this _Section 6.02(c)_ , the Company shall be permitted to, and if the
Company fails to do so, Parent shall, obtain and fully pay the premium for a
seven-year prepaid "tail" policy for the extension of the directors' and
officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery
period of seven years from and after the Effective Time, on terms and
conditions providing coverage retentions, limits and other material terms
substantially equivalent to the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall, in
cooperation with Parent, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
most favorable pricing and most comprehensive coverage reasonably available
for such "tail" policy and neither the Company nor Parent shall commit or
spend on such "tail" policy more than 300% of the last aggregate annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for the Company's

with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable in all material respects as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase comparable directors' and
officers' liability coverage for such seven-year period (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such seven-year period
thereunder have not exceeded the applicable statute of limitations) with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable in all material respects as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , in each case, in no
event shall Parent be required to commit or spend more than the Base Amount on
any such directors' and officers' liability coverage.

the agreements contained in this _Section 9.03_  are an integral part of the
Transactions, (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Infiniti, Holdco, Merger
Sub and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement and (iii) any
amount payable pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ is not a penalty, but rather

Parent of its rights under this _Section 9.03_ incurred in connection with
defending such Proceeding to collect such fees); and (B) the Company shall pay

Bloomberg L.P. on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be
paid). If neither Parent nor Infiniti pays when due any amount payable under
this _Section 9.03_ , then: (x) Parent and Infiniti, severally and jointly,
shall reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount and the enforcement by the Company of its rights under this
_Section 9.03_ incurred in connection with defending such Proceeding to
collect such fees); and (y) Parent and Infiniti, severally and jointly, shall
pay to the Company interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing
as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the Company in
full) at a rate per annum equal to 300 basis points over the "prime rate" (as
reported by Bloomberg L.P. on the date such overdue amount was originally

except in the case of a Willful Breach (and subject to _Section 9.03(d)_ ),
(i) if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee would be payable pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ , the

Section 10.08 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions, taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement, subject to  _Section 10.02_
, so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without

Parent may designate, prior to the Effective Time, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a party to
the Merger in lieu of Holdco or Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Holdco or Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall be deemed

and warranties made herein with respect to Holdco or Merger Sub, as
applicable, as of the date hereof) and all representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Holdco or Merger Sub, as applicable, as of the
date hereof shall also be made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of
the date of such designation and (b) Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub may
collaterally assign any or all of their respective rights or obligations
hereunder to any Debt Financing sources; _provided_ , _further_ , such
assignment shall not relieve Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub, as the case may
be, of its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other Party or due to Parent or such other Subsidiary. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. This Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

a party shall be considered, on the one hand, the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and, on the other hand, Parent and/or any of its Subsidiaries
and/or the Investors.

  



  

(e) Each Party and the Investors hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for
the benefit of each other party, that any legal action, suit or proceeding

Agreement. Infiniti further agrees that it will not agree, without the prior
written consent of the Company, to any amendment of or modification to, or
grant any waiver with respect to, the Investment Agreement as in effect on

information supplied by Shareholder specifically for use in any such

pursuant to the Merger Agreement and such Shareholder hereby consents to such
consideration, including the amount and form thereof.

  



  

3. _Termination_.

5. _General Provisions_.

  



  

(a) _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after any vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated
hereby, by written agreement of Infiniti, Audi and Shareholder at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment, modification or supplement that
materially and adversely affects the rights of the Company, or
materially increases the obligations of the Company, shall be made only with
the approval of the Company.

  



  

(b) _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to the remainder of this _Section 5(b)_ ,
at any time prior to the Closing, either Infiniti, Audi or Shareholder may,
to the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by: (i) in the case of any such waiver or
extension of which Shareholder is the beneficiary, each of Infiniti or Audi;
(ii) in the case of any such waiver or extension of which Infiniti or Audi is
the beneficiary, Audi or Infiniti, respectively, and, in each case,
Shareholder; and (iii) in the case of any such waiver or extension of which
the Company is the beneficiary, Shareholder, Infiniti and Audi. The failure of
any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by such Party, as the case may be, of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of
this Agreement and any schedules attached hereto, the following rules
of interpretation shall apply:

(ii) Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all genders, and
words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice
versa;

  



  

(iii) The division of this Agreement into Sections and other subdivisions and
the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified;

  



  

(iv) The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and "hereunder"
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which
such words appear unless the context otherwise expressly requires;

  



  

(v) The word "including" or any variation thereof means "including, without
limitation," and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that
it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following

(vi) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or

Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Investment Transactions and Transactions, taken as a whole,
are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties, as closely as

and Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic mail transmission (including in portable document
format (pdf) or otherwise) or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

     2.  | On  _13/3/19_ at a meeting that was duly convened, the
company's Board of Directors adopted a resolution to approve  the following,
after considering the financial condition of the merging companies and
determining that there is no reasonable  concern, in its opinion that, as a
result of the merger, the Surviving Company will not be able to fulfill the
company's  obligations to its creditors.

The  merger is a reverse triangular merger, meaning the Target Company will
merge into the  Surviving Company and will cease to exist, and the Surviving
Company will become a wholly  owned subsidiary of the PowerFleet Israel
Holding Company Ltd. (Priv. Co. No. 515984003)  ("Israeli Holding
Company")(the "Merger"), which is a wholly  owned subsidiary of PowerFleet,
Inc., a company incorporated in the State of Delaware  (the "Parent
Company"), and will be listed for trade on the Nasdaq upon completion  of the
merger. Holders of issued shares or shares which may be issued under the
terms  of securities that are convertible for shares in the Surviving Company
(collectively,  "Surviving Company Shareholders"), will receive consideration
in cash and  in Parent Company Shares, as agreed in the agreement between the
parties.

 



 

To  complete the picture, it is noted that simultaneously with the Merger,
the Parent Company will acquire (by means of a  parallel reverse triangular
merger under Delaware law) all of the ordinary shares of I.D. Systems, Inc., a
corporation  incorporated in the State of Delaware that is currently listed
for trade on the Nasdaq ("I.D. Systems"), and  the shareholders of I.D.
Systems will receive one ordinary share in the Parent Company for each
ordinary share of I.D.  Systems owned by them.

 _Principal Grounds Provided by the Target Company 's Board of Directors:_

  



     1.    | Since  the Target Company has no creditors, and based on a
review of the financial condition of the merging companies (in reliance, 
_inter alia_ , on the representations made by the Surviving Company which are
set forth in the merger agreement), there  is no reasonable suspicion that,
as a result of the Merger, the Surviving Company will not be able to meet the
Target Company's  obligations to its creditors. 
---|--- 
   2.  | The  Merger provides synergistic advantages between the relevant
companies, as they operate in similar fields around the world. 
   3.  | The  proposed Merger is fair and benefits the Target Company and
its parent company.

 _Principal Grounds Provided by the Surviving Company 's Board of Directors:_

  



  

The proposed Merger is fair and benefits the Surviving Company, _inter alia_
, in light of the following:

  



     1.    | The  Surviving Company's Board of Directors' familiarity
with the business, financial condition, outcome from operations,  current
business strategy, and forecasts of the Surviving Company, as well as the
risks involved in the fulfillment of these  forecasts and targets under
current market and industry conditions, the nature of the markets in which it
operates, and its  standing in these markets. 
---|--- 
     | 
   2.    | There  is no reasonable concern that, as a result of the
Merger, the Surviving Company will not be able to meet its obligations to 
its creditors, taking into account the financial condition of the Surviving
Company and the Target Company. The foregoing  is based on: (i) the debt
schedule of the merging companies and the sources available to them for the
purpose of repayment;  (ii) the representations in the merger agreement;
(iii) the due diligence processes performed by the Surviving Company and  its
advisors; (iv) the decrease of the level of the Surviving Company's new debt
after the Merger and the concomitant  change in consideration resulting from
the negotiations prior to signing the merger agreement; (v) the fact that the
Target  Company: has no material assets or liabilities, other than its rights
and obligations arising under the merger agreement (and  based in part on the
representations of the Target Company), has had no commercial operations since
inception and is not expected  to have any such operations prior to the
closing of the Merger; (vi) the opportunities open to the Surviving Company
following  the closing of the Merger for business development, improving its
liquidity and capital structure, decreased financing costs  and savings in
regulatory costs; and (vi) additional information presented by management of
the Surviving Company in response  to questions from the Board of Directors. 
     | 
   3.    | The  possible alternatives to the Merger, including the
possibility of continuing to operate the Surviving Company in its current 
format and the limitations on the company's growth. 
     | 
   4.  | The  financial terms, as well as the other terms of the merger
agreement as reviewed by the Surviving Company's Board of  Directors, and the
fact that these terms are the result of negotiation between the parties. 
     | 
   5.    | The  fact that the consideration for the Merger will be paid
partly in cash and partly in Parent Company Shares, such that it will 
benefit the Surviving Company's shareholders in the short term and will permit
them to enjoy the potential growth of  the Parent Company in the long term. 
     | 
   6.    | According  to the fairness opinion of ROTH Capital Partners,
which was delivered to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Company,  as
of the date of the opinion, the consideration to be paid to the shareholders
of the Surviving Company pursuant to the merger  agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such shareholders.

facts of the transaction. 
---|--- 
     |

company traded on the Nasdaq with extensive operations that will  allow
improvement in the options for the financing and business development of the
Surviving Company and the marketing of  its products. 
     | 
   9.    | The  financial ability and industrial experience of the Parent
Company and its new investor, Abry Partners, which is a reputable  investment
fund which can contribute to the Parent Company's success to the benefit of
all of its shareholders.
