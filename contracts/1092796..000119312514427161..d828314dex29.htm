amended Tax Returns and any Tax Proceeding in connection therewith. The cost
of preparing and filing such amended Tax Returns shall be borne by the Seller.

 

(iv) The Seller shall be entitled to any refund or credit of Tax received by
the Company or its Subsidiary after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-
Closing Period, to the extent such amount exceeds the amount set forth on the

amount equal to any such refund or credit after adjustment for any Tax effect
to the Company as a result of such refund or credit, within ten (10) days

treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

(v) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company or
its Subsidiary to file a Tax Return with respect to a taxable period that
ended on or prior to the Closing (or amend a Tax Return filed pursuant to
clause (ii) above after the Closing but including the Closing Date) without
the Sellers prior consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

(vi) The Buyer shall retain (or cause the Company to retain) all Books and

Governmental Entity.

arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer shall
timely file all Tax Returns relating to such Taxes and timely remit to the
appropriate Governmental Entity any such Taxes, and shall give a copy of such

payment of the Tax, if any, shown thereon to be due. The Buyer shall give a
copy of each such Tax Return to the Seller prior to filing for its review and

affect the Sellers rights set forth in Article 10).

(viii) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall
elect (and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to elect) to treat the
taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date with respect
to any Tax of the Company or its Subsidiary as ending at the end of the
Closing Date, and shall take such steps as may be necessary therefor. If such
an election cannot be made, for purposes of this Agreement, any Tax for a
taxable period that includes but that does not end on the Closing Date shall
be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the balance of the taxable
period based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any real or personal property Tax, fixed
dollar franchise Tax and any annual exemption amount shall be allocated based
on the relative number of days in the Pre-Closing Period and the balance of
the taxable period.

(g)  _Insurance Policy_. The parties acknowledge that the Buyer has obtained
the RandW Insurance Policy, in the amount of $20,000,000 bound as of the date
hereof and to remain in effect with respect to particular representations
and warranties for such time as such representations and warranties survive
(as set forth in Section 10.4 below), but no longer than six years from the
date of Closing. The RandW Insurance Policy has been issued by a recognized
insurance carrier (the "Carrier") rated by AM Best at A or better for the
benefit of the Buyer and the Company and customized based on the terms of this
Agreement. The RandW Insurance Policy is a "Buyers" policy and has
been negotiated by the Buyer and the Carrier in consultation with the Seller.
The premium (including the underwriting fee, taxes and other fees of the
insurer) for the RandW Insurance Policy shall be paid by the Seller at Closing
up to a maximum amount of $780,000 (which shall include the $78,000 deposit
paid by the Buyer to the Insurer on the date hereof). Any portion of the
premium for the RandW Insurance Policy in excess of the $780,000 to be paid by
Seller shall be paid by the Buyer at Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event that the Closing shall not take place, Seller shall not be required
to pay such premium.

 

(h) _HSR Act Filing_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each of the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiary, on
the other hand, agrees to file (and the Buyer agrees to cause any Person that
may be deemed to be the ultimate parent entity or otherwise to control the
Buyer to file, if such filing is required by law) as soon as practicable, and
in any event (i) if this Agreement is executed

 



39  prior to 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, on the day of execution, unless this
Agreement is not executed on a Business Day, in which case on the next
Business Day following the day of execution or (ii) if this Agreement is
executed at or after 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, on the next Business Day
following the day of execution, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR
Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and to request
for early termination.

(ii) The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiary, on the other hand, to (i) respond as promptly as practicable
to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity for
additional information or documentation, and (ii) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer shall
take reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible and to avoid any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing. Each party shall (i)
promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party or
its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable Law,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate, or to
permit its Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their
Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except that the Company shall be under no obligation of any
kind to provide any other party documents, material or other information
relating to the valuation of the Company or to alternatives to the proposed
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(iii) The Seller on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand, may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) as "outside counsel only"; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials concerning the valuation of the Business may be
redacted. Materials designated as for "outside counsel only" and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the material or its legal counsel.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, in case at any
time after the Closing Date any further

 



40  action is necessary or desirable to secure the approvals from any and all
Governmental Entities necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and/or directors of the parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all such
necessary action.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to make any divestitures.

 

(v) All filing fees under the HSR Act shall be borne by the Buyer.

 

(i) _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance_. At the Closing,
the Seller shall obtain a "tail" policy providing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage, for the benefit of the Covered Persons, for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Closing that is at least equal to the coverage
provided under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policies in effect as of the date of this Agreement and which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiary or any of their respective
directors or officers. The cost of such "tail" insurance policy shall be borne
by the Buyer. "Covered Persons" means each of the Companys and its
Subsidiarys present and former managers, directors and officers who have
served in such capacities since January 1, 2006 through the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to, maintain in
effect in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and its
Subsidiary provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of
expenses that are no less favorable to the Covered Persons than they are with
respect to the then-current managers, directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiary. The obligations of the Buyer under this Section 8.1(i)
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Covered Person to whom this Section 8.1(i) applies without the express
written consent of such affected Covered Person.

(j) _Exclusivity_. In consideration of the Buyer entering into this Agreement
and devoting significant time and resources towards exploring a possible
transaction, until the Release Time (i) each Member will cease, and will cause
the Company, its Subsidiary and their respective employees, legal counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, accountants, consultants and other
representatives to cease all existing discussions among the Company, its
Subsidiary, the Seller and the Members with any Third Party with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) and (ii) prior to any termination
of this Agreement as set forth in Article 11 hereto, the Company, its
Subsidiary, the Seller and each Member will not engage in or continue any
Solicitation (as defined below) or take any action to authorize or permit any
of the foregoing to engage in or continue any Solicitation. The Seller and
each of the Members hereby represent that neither it, the Company nor its
Subsidiary is now engaged in discussions or negotiations with any other party
other than the Buyer with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal for (A) a sale or issuance of
any shares of capital stock in the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary, (B)
a merger, consolidation, sale of a substantial portion of the assets or any
similar transaction or business combination involving the Seller, the Company
or its Subsidiary, (C) any other transaction involving the Seller, the 

 



41  Company or any of its securities or assets that would have an effect similar
to the transactions described in (A) or (B), or (D) any other transaction that
would reasonably likely have the effect of proscribing the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, including, without limitation, a
recapitalization or refinancing. The term "Solicitation" shall mean any action
or activity pursuant to which any Person, directly or indirectly, solicits,
entertains or enters into any agreement, negotiations with, or furnishes any
information to any Person (other than the Buyer or any agent, Affiliate,
representative or other designee of the Buyer), with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, including, without limitation, discussions between or
among the Members.

(k) _Books and Records_. 

(i) In order to facilitate the resolution of any Claims made against or
incurred by the Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable
purpose, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing, the Buyer shall:

(A) retain the Books and Records (including personnel files) of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent
with the prior practices of the Company; and

 

(B) upon reasonable notice, afford the Seller reasonable access (including the
right to make, at the Sellers expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such Books and Records.

(ii) In order to facilitate the resolution of any Claims made by or against
or incurred by the Buyer or the Company after the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of three (3) years following the Closing, the
Seller shall:

 

(A) retain the Books and Records (including personnel files) of the Seller
which relate to the Company and its operations for periods prior to the
Closing; and

(B) upon reasonable notice, afford the Buyer or the Company reasonable
access (including the right to make, at the Buyers expense, photocopies),
during normal business hours, to such Books and Records.

 

(iii) Neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall be obligated to provide the other
party with access to any Books and Records (including personnel files)
pursuant to this Section 8.1(k) where such access would violate any Law.

8.2 _Mutual Covenants_. The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with each
other with respect to the following:

(a) _Satisfaction of Conditions_. The Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer,
on the other, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligation of all parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



42 (b) _Public Statements_. During the period prior to Closing, before the Buyer,
on the one hand, or the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary on the other
hand, shall release any information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby which is intended for or may result in public
dissemination thereof; such party shall furnish drafts of all documents or
proposed oral statements to the other party, for comments, and shall not
release any such information without the written Consent of the other party.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent any party hereto from releasing any
information (i) to any Governmental Entity if required to do so by Law
(including any filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission),
and (ii) after the Closing if such information is not Proprietary
and Confidential Information and (x) is of a nature customarily conveyed by
private equity funds to the general public in a tombstone or other similar
announcement or (y) is of a nature customarily conveyed by private equity
funds to investors, potential investors, lenders and the like.

each Member, severally and not jointly, and on a pro-rata basis hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against

or warranty.

10.2  _Limitations on Indemnification; R andW Insurance Policy_.

(a) _Certain Limitations on the Buyer s Indemnification with Respect to
Claims_.

(i) _Member Liability_. With respect to indemnification for any Claims
based upon, attributable to or related to (A) Section 10.1(a)(i) hereof, the
Members shall not have any liability as all such related Claims will be made
solely against the RandW Insurance Policy and (B) Section 10.1(a)(ii)
hereof, the Members shall not have any liability that exceeds an amount equal
to the Purchase Price.

(ii) _Seller Liability_. With respect to indemnification for any Claims based
upon, attributable to or related to (A) Section 10.1(b)(i) hereof, the Seller
shall not have any liability as all such related Claims will be made solely
against the RandW

 



44  Insurance Policy and (B) Section 10.1(b)(ii) hereof, the Seller shall not
have any liability that exceeds an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

 

(b) _Certain Limitations on the Seller s Indemnification with Respect to
Claims_. With respect to indemnification for any Claims based upon,
attributable to or related to Section 10.1(c) hereof, (A) the Buyer shall not
have any liability unless the aggregate amount of Losses to all Seller
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Buyer Basket and thereafter Buyer shall be
liable for the total amount of such Losses (and the Buyer Basket limitation
shall not apply) and (B) no amounts of indemnity shall be payable by the Buyer
which exceed the Buyer Indemnity Cap.

 

(c) _Buyer Basket and Buyer Indemnity Cap Not Applicable_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to
indemnification for any Claims based upon, attributable to or related to: (x)
the amount of indemnity payable by the Buyer as a result of Claim arising
under the first two sentences of Section 5.1(b) of this Agreement (Authority,
etc.), Section 5.1(c) (Consents of Governmental Entities), Section 5.1(e)
(Brokerage) (collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental Representations") and (y)
Claims with respect to breaches of covenants or fraud, the Buyer Basket and
the Buyer Indemnity Cap shall not apply to any such Claim and the Buyer shall
be liable up to the Purchase Price.

 

(d) _R andW Insurance Policy_. The Buyer, the Members and the Seller acknowledge
that Buyer has obtained the RandW Insurance Policy for coverage of the Members
and the Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to Sections 10.1(a)(i)
and 10.1(b)(i) with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Members and the Seller contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any and all Losses that are
based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of any
representation or warranty of the Members or the Seller set forth in Articles
3 or 4 of this Agreement or any representation or warranty contained in the
certificates delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(d) and (k) hereof, by or on
behalf of the Members or the Seller to be true and correct in all respects as
of the date made, the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive recourse
for the Members and the Sellers indemnification obligations under Sections
10.1(a)(i) and 10.1(b)(i) shall be limited to the RandW Insurance Policy. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Members and the Seller shall have no liability
with respect to Claims made hereunder pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(i) and
10.1(b)(i) even in the event a Claim is denied in whole or in part by the
Carrier. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members and the Sellers liability
for any Claim based on Sections 10.1(a)(ii), 10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(ii), or
10.1(b)(iii) (which Claims the Parties acknowledge are not subject to the RandW
Insurance Policy) shall not be limited, except as set forth in Section
10.2(a).

10.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim made against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may be
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however,

 



45  relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except
and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses
by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to this Section 10.3(a),
it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided,
that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A)
there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Third Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 10.3(b), pay, compromise, or defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating
to such Third Party Claim; provided; however, that the Indemnified Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts in the defense of all such claims.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 10.3(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to
assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle
the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to Section 10.3(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



46 (c) _Direct Claims_. Any Claim by an Indemnified Party pursuant to
Sections 10.1(a)(ii), 10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(ii), 10.1(b)(iii), or 10.1(c) on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to
the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including reasonable access to the Indemnified Partys premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records
upon reasonable notice and during business hours) as the Indemnifying Party or
any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available
to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

(d) In the case of any amount payable to any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article 10, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnifying Party
notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the Claim shall be satisfied as
follows:

(i) In the case of any amount payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party, with
respect to Claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties related to (A) any breach
of any representation or warranty, such amount shall be satisfied solely from
the Carrier pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy (and if such Claim is denied
in whole or in part by the Carrier, the Members and the Seller shall continue
to have no liability with respect to such Claims), and (B) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, or any breach of any covenant in this Agreement, such
amount shall be satisfied by the Members, severally on a pro-rata basis,
payable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within ten (10) Business Days.

 

(ii) In the case of any amount payable to a Seller Indemnified Party, the
Buyer shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the Seller
Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of such notice.

 

(e) The failure of the Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of
any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying
Partys obligations with

 



47  respect thereto except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party can
demonstrate actual Loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.3 to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement of any Claim effected
without its written Consent, which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party shall have the exclusive
authority to defend such Claim under this Section 10.3, and the Indemnified
Party nevertheless settles such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability with respect to such settlement.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Claims made pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)(i) and 10.1(b)(i) shall be made solely against the RandW
Insurance Policy and shall not be subject to the provisions of Section
10.3(a), (b), (c) and (f) above. 

(h) _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(i) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article 10 (including any payment received by Buyer under the RandW Insurance
Policy) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by Law.

10.4 _Survival of Claims_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.4, all representations and
warranties of the Seller and the Buyer contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date for a period of fifteen (15) months following the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, (i) the Fundamental Representations, (ii) Claims with respect to
fraud, and (iii) any Claim for a breach of a covenant made pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto. 

(b) The indemnification provided for in this Article 10 shall terminate at the
applicable time set forth in Section 10.4(a) (and no Claims shall be made by
any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party thereafter), except
that such indemnification by the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall
continue as to any Losses with respect to which any Buyer Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, has validly given a notice of a
Claim to the Seller or to the Buyer, as applicable, in accordance with the
requirements of Section 10.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification
would otherwise terminate in accordance with Section 10.4(a), as to which the
obligation of the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall continue solely
with respect to the specific matters described in such notice of a Claim until
the liability of the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall have been
determined pursuant to this Article 10 and the Seller shall have reimbursed
all Buyer Indemnified Parties, or the Buyer shall have reimbursed all Seller
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, for the full amount of such Losses that
are payable with respect to such notice of a Claim in accordance with this
Article 10.

10.5  _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the event of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, and subject to the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
to recover under the RandW Insurance Policy, the rights to indemnification set
forth in this Article 10 shall be the sole

 



48  and exclusive remedy of an Indemnified Party for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek to specifically
enforce any covenant of Members or the Seller. Except in the event of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the
other parties hereto and their Affiliates arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
10. For purposes of clarity, as between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
issuer of the RandW Insurance Policy, on the other hand, none of the limitations
and restrictions (including time for asserting claims) on indemnification set

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
terminated:

 

(a) _Agreement_. By mutual consent in writing of the Buyer and the Seller;

 

(b) _By the Buyer_. By the Buyer: (i) upon written notice to the Seller if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or
prior to January 22, 2015, unless such failure of consummation shall be due to
the failure of the Buyer to perform or observe in all material respects the
covenants and agreements hereof to be performed or observed by the Buyer; or
(ii) if the Seller has breached any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Buyer has notified

(c) _By the Seller_. By the Seller: (i) upon written notice to the Buyer if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on

material respects the covenants and agreements hereof to be performed or
observed by the Seller or the Members; or (ii) if the Buyer has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in
any material respect, the Seller has notified the Buyer of the breach, and

pursuant to Section 11.1, all further obligations of the parties under this

have as a result of a breach by another party of any covenant under this
Agreement and (ii) the obligations of the parties contained in Section 12.3
hereof shall survive any such termination.

12.2  _Waiver of Compliance_. Any failure of the Members or the Seller, on
the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be expressly waived in
writing by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure by the Company, the Seller,
the Members or the Buyer.

12.3 _Expenses_. In the event that the Closing shall not take place, then
subject to all rights and remedies that a party may have against another party

51 12.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor

12.10 _Entire Agreement; Schedules_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto and the Transaction Documents set forth the entire agreement
of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and
therein, and supersede all prior agreements, whether oral or written, by any
officer or employee of any party hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof. To the extent that any disclosure in any single Schedule
reasonably puts the Buyer on actual notice of the facts reflected therein and
the significance of such facts with respect to this Agreement, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a disclosure in all other Schedules under this
Agreement as to such facts.

12.11 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically set forth or
referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other than the parties
hereto and their successors or assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement.

12.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be
held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision shall be
reformed to the maximum extent permitted to preserve the parties original
intent; failing which, it shall be severed from this Agreement with the
balance of this Agreement continuing in full force and effect. Such
occurrence shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question
invalid in any other jurisdiction or in any other case or circumstances, or of
rendering invalid any other provisions contained therein to the extent that
such other provisions are not themselves actually in conflict with any
applicable Law.

12.13 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against the Persons that are parties hereto and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Except as expressly set forth herein, no past, present
or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or seller of any such party or of
any or assignee thereof, shall have any liability for any obligation of a
party to this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection

 



52  with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law (it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any current or future officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or seller of any such party or any
current or future member of any such party or of any assignee thereof).

 

12.14 _Attorney-Client Privilege_. The parties agree to take the steps
necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel
representing the Company in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will survive the Closing and remain in effect; provided, that from and after
the Closing such privilege will be controlled by the Seller and not the
Company. In addition, Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause the Company to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
such counsel representing the Seller after the Closing, including in
connection with a dispute with the Buyer or the Company following the Closing.

 

12.15 _Acknowledgement by the Buyer; Disclaimers_.

 

(a) The Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the financial condition, operations, assets,
liabilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiary and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Buyer has relied and will rely on the results of its own
independent investigation and the representations and warranties of the
Members and the Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement,
including the Schedules.

 

(b) The Buyer agrees that none of the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary or
any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to the Buyer or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Buyer, or the Buyers
use of, the Confidential Information Memorandum prepared by Robert W. Baird and
Co. Incorporated and any information, document or material made available to
the Buyer in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any other form
in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With
respect to all materials that are described as having been made available
or delivered to the Buyer, such materials shall be deemed to have been
delivered or made available to the Buyer if the Buyer or agents have been
granted access to a dataroom, electronic dataroom or website in which such
materials were available or by transmitting such materials to the Buyer or
agents by any other electronic means prior to three (3) Business Days before
the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE MEMBERS AND THE SELLER
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLES 3 AND 4 CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE MEMBERS, THE SELLER, THE COMPANY AND ITS
SUBSIDIARY TO THE BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, AND THE BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED (INCLUDING, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL

 



53  FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR
PROSPECTS OF ANY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY), ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE SELLER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MEMBERS. THE BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT DID NOT RELY ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY NOT
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT WHEN MAKING ITS DECISION TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND WILL NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN DECIDING
TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

(d) In connection with the Buyers investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiary, the Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiary certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its
Subsidiary for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014 and for subsequent
fiscal years and certain business plan information for such fiscal year and
succeeding fiscal years. The Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections, that the Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, that the Buyer is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections so
furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such projections), and that the Buyer shall have no Claim against
the Seller, the Company, its Subsidiary or any other Person with respect
thereto. Accordingly, none of the Seller or the Company makes any
representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such projections
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections).
