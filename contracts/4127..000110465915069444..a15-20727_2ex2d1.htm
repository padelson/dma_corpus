 **ARTICLE III _ 
CONVERSION OF SHARES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become

 



      
 

 



 

one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury shares and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or
any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective
Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock then issued and
outstanding (other than Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and the holders of
Book Entry Shares and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented outstanding Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than the right to receive, upon transfer of such Book Entry Shares or delivery
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, for each such share of the Company Common Stock.

 



 

(d) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
any change in the number of issued or outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, share
split (including a reverse share split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or share distribution (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock) with a record date during such period, the amount of the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(c) shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a United States bank or
trust company or other independent financial institution in the United States
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act,
among other things, as paying agent for the Merger and to deliver the Merger
Consideration to former stockholders of the Company. The Company and Parent
shall enter into a Paying Agent agreement with the Paying Agent, which
agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the
Paying Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Paying Agent, for the account and benefit of the former holders of Company
Common Stock, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Article III (such cash shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Consideration Fund_ "). In the event the Consideration
Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (including with
respect to Company Common Stock held by stockholders who did not vote in favor
of the Merger but who did not exercise, or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, their rights to appraisal of such Company Common Stock
under the DGCL), Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered,
additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the
deficiency required to make such payments.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each stockholder whose shares were converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1: (i) a letter of
transmittal, in customary form, that shall specify that delivery of such
Certificates or transfer of such Book Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Book Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or transfer of the Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of
transmittal and instructions shall be as reasonably agreed to by the Company
and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry
Share or surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, in
each case together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Book Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Book
Entry Share so transferred or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or
Certificates in connection with, or accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If
any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the stockholder
in whose name the Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the stockholder owning the Book Entry Share transferred or
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(c) The cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States. Earnings on the Consideration
Fund in excess of the amounts payable to the Companys former stockholders
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall be paid as Parent
directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this Article III, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Companys stockholders at the Effective Time in
the amount of such losses to the extent the funds in the Consideration Fund
are insufficient for such purposes, which additional funds will be deemed to
be part of the Consideration Fund.

 



 

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the share
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any

 



      
 

 



 

reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article III, except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Company stockholders
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for no
consideration. Any Company stockholder owning Certificates or Book Entry
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article III with respect to
such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
not have been surrendered or transferred, respectively, prior to the date on
which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law,
any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any stockholder of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (which affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this Article III.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, but
rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1. The Company shall provide prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the opportunity to
participate in and direct any and all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such

 



       
 

 



 

demands. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the prior written
consent of the other party, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock
Units; and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested Company Stock Option
and each outstanding Underwater Option (whether unvested or vested) shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and
converted into an option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Option (modified as appropriate to reflect
the assumption), that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, and (y) the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the Parent
Measurement Price (the " _Option Ratio_ "), at an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such assumed Company Stock
Option equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (each, as so adjusted, a " _Converted
Parent Option_ ").

 



 

(b) The Converted Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any applicable change of control or other accelerated vesting
provisions, provided that this transaction shall constitute the change of
control for all relevant provisions that accelerate vesting) as the Company
Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions as such
Company Stock Options (modified as appropriate to reflect the assumption);
_provided_ , that Parent shall convert Company Stock Options into Converted
Parent Options in a manner intended to ensure that the Converted Parent
Options are not subject to Section 409A of the Code as a result of the
assumption and conversion.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Stock Option
(other than any such vested Company Stock Option that is an Underwater Option
and including those Company Stock Options that become vested by their terms
immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time) shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive therefor (subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld) an
amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), if any, equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which such
Company Stock Option was vested and exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time (giving effect to any acceleration of vesting resulting solely
from the Merger), and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Stock
Option shall no longer be exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock and
shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to the payment
described in this Section

 



      
 

 



 

3.4(c), which shall be made by the Surviving Corporation in the next
practicable payroll following the Effective Time.

shares of the Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Units, and (y) the Option Ratio. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this
Section 3.4(d) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Restricted Stock Units (including any applicable
change of control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this
transaction shall constitute the change of control for all relevant provisions
that accelerate vesting), with the terms and conditions modified as
appropriate to reflect the assumption.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company Restricted
Stock Unit (including those Company Restricted Stock Units that become vested
by their terms immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time) shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to
any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by
applicable Law to be withheld) an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit. The payment described in this Section 3.4(e) shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation in the next practicable payroll following the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that such payment shall be made at such other time or times
following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company
Restricted Stock Unit to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of
additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(f) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into that number of restricted
stock units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share
("Converted PRSUs") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Restricted Stock
Units, assuming achievement of target-level performance with respect to each
performance period, performance cycle or measurement cycle applicable to such
Company Performance Restricted Stock Units and (y) the Option Ratio. Any
Converted PRSUs issued pursuant to this Section 3.4(f) shall continue to be
subject to the vesting schedule applicable to the Company Performance
Restricted Stock Units, including that the Converted PRSUs will be settled no
later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month
following the end of the applicable measurement cycle or the applicable
vesting date, as applicable, subject only to the continued service of the
grantee with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate through each
applicable vesting date or measurement cycle end date but shall not be subject
to any performance metrics following the Effective Time, and shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions (modified as appropriate to
reflect the assumption) as were applicable under such Company Performance
Restricted Stock Units (after giving effect to and including any applicable
change of control or

 



      
 

 



 

other accelerated vesting provisions, for which purposes this transaction
shall constitute the change of control).

 



 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the provisions set forth in this Section 3.4; _provided_ , that
no action taken by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to
develop mechanisms with respect to any Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units held by
individuals subject to the Laws of a country other than the United States to
mitigate the tax impact of the provisions set forth in this Section 3.4 and
adhere to applicable Law (without creating obligations that extend to future
grants).

 



 

(h) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Companys 2008 Equity
Plan shall be assumed by Parent.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Paying Agent, Parent, Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger
Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as may be required under the Code or any other provision of applicable
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Company Special Shares_. The special shares (the " _Company
Special Shares_ ") of PMC-Sierra, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary of the Company,

thereof, in lieu of each share of Company Common Stock that would have been
issuable in respect of such redacted Company Special Shares, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration, under that certain
Exchange Agreement, dated as of September 2, 1994, as amended (the " _Exchange
Agreement_ ") among the Company, PMC-Sierra, Ltd. and the other parties
thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement.

be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has not conducted any business prior to the
date hereof, and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its

Section 5.10 _Availability of Funds; Financing_. Parents and Subs
obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parents or
Subs obtaining of funds to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and/or Sub will have available to it sufficient
funds to pay the Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be
paid by Parent and Sub in connection with the consummation of the Merger on
the Closing Date and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including all
related fees and expenses. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of a fully executed commitment letter, together with the
related fee letter (solely in the case of the fee letter, with only the fee
amounts, pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms that do
not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or conditionality of, or
the aggregate amount of proceeds available under, the Debt Financing contained
therein redacted), each in effect as of the date of this Agreement from
Barclays Bank PLC (together, as they may be amended, modified or replaced in
accordance with Section 6.13 and together with all annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") to
provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner, and, as of
the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no amendment or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter is contemplated. The Debt
Commitment Letter, including the commitments contained therein, has not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission
is contemplated. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees and amounts in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full

 



      
 

 



 

force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect, affecting creditors
rights and remedies generally, and to general principles of equity. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Subject to Section 6.13(c), as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements or contracts of any kind, in each case to which Parent is a party,
relating to the Debt Financing that could affect the availability of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would
constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, under the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 are satisfied at Closing and assuming the
performance by the Company of its obligations under Section 6.13, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied by Parent prior to the Closing Date or that
the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Immediately following the Closing after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
excluding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in Article IV, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will
be Solvent. As used herein, "Solvent" means with respect to any Person on a
particular date, that on such date (a) the fair value of the property of such
Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including, contingent
liabilities, of such Person, (b) the present fair salable value of the assets
of such Person is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become absolute and
matured, (c) such Person has not incurred, and does not intend to incur, debts
or liabilities beyond such Persons ability to pay such debts and liabilities
as they mature and (d) such Person is not engaged in business or a
transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a transaction, for
which such Persons property would constitute an unreasonably small capital.
The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed under this
Section 5.11 as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that is probable to
become an actual or matured liability.

customers, suppliers or service providers granted in the ordinary course of
business;

 



 

(xv) change any material method of Tax accounting, settle or compromise any

these purposes any settlement or compromise relating to a Tax item to the
extent that such settlement or compromise does not materially exceed the
reserves for such Tax item established in the Company Financial Statements),

(xvi) enter into, modify or amend any material Contract outside of the

(xviii) enter into any Contract, commitment or arrangement to do any of the

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but, in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall provide
the information with respect to non-U.S. employees, Foreign Benefit Plans, and
non-U.S. based equity compensation that it was unable to provide before the
date of this Agreement. The Company and each Subsidiary shall comply (prior to
the Closing Date) with their respective obligations, if any, to inform,
consult with, and/or obtain consent from any of its employees or their related
trade unions, works councils, or other collective representatives about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. The Company shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) afford to directors, officers, employees, counsel,
investment bankers, accountants and other authorized representatives ("
_Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not unreasonably
disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries in each case as may reasonably
be requested for reasonable purposes related to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose any information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, be expected to (i) violate applicable Law
or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement (as long as the
Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the
other party to the agreement), or (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client, work product doctrine or other legal privilege held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided further_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any invasive
additional diligence investigation after the date of this Agreement, including
investigations or sampling at any property owned, operated or leased by the
Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it
shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or
information and shall use its reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to information furnished
hereunder by or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). The Company
agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to permit the
inclusion of all actual or prospective sources of debt financing (including
convertible or equity-linked debt) (and representatives of such financing
sources) in the term "Representative" as such term is defined therein.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees and
other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit,
seek or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage, any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any negotiations,
inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in
connection with any such inquiries, proposals or offers, disclose or furnish
any nonpublic information or data to any Person concerning the Companys
business or properties or afford any Person other than Parent or its
Representatives access to its properties, books, or records pursuant to a
governmental subpoena or other governmental request for information, (iv)
enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (v) approve, endorse, recommend or make
or authorize any public statement, recommendation, or solicitation in support
of, or submit to the Companys stockholders, any Acquisition Proposal, (vi)
take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through (vi). The
Company and its Subsidiaries will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all
activities, discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of
this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall terminate access to
any virtual data room established by the Company and request that all
confidential or proprietary information previously furnished to any party
(other than Parent) in connection with any such discussions and negotiations
be promptly returned or destroyed. The Company acknowledges and agrees that,
in the event any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
takes any action that if taken by the Company would be a breach of this
_Section 6.3_, the taking of such action by such Representative shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.3, the
Company and its board of directors may (subject to compliance with this
Section 6.3) participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company containing terms that are
not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, which may not provide for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying
with this Section 6.3(b)) making such contact or making such Acquisition
Proposal and their respective Representatives and potential sources of
financing, if prior to Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons have submitted
to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure

 



      
 

 



 

to participate in such discussions or negotiations, furnish such information,
enter into any agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or accept any
offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys
directors under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) (i) notify Parent of the receipt
by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent a copy
of such Acquisition Proposal (if written), or a summary of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (if oral), including the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and copies of all written
communications with such Person with respect to such actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of any
decision of its board of directors as to whether to consider any Acquisition
Proposal or to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public information with respect to the
Company to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable
after such determination was reached (and in any event no later than twenty
four (24) hours after such determination was reached). The Company will (i)
provide Parent with written notice setting forth all such information as is
reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in all material respects of the
status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any material
amendments thereto, (ii) keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable with
respect to any changes to the material terms of an Acquisition Proposal
submitted to the Company (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
following any such changes), including by providing a copy of all written
proposals and a summary of all oral proposals or material oral modifications
to an earlier written proposal, in each case relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
following the provision of any non-public information of the Company to any
such Person, provide such information to Parent (including by posting such
information to an electronic data room), to the extent such information has
not previously been provided or made available to Parent, and (iv) promptly
(and in any event within twenty four (24) hours of such determination) notify
Parent of any determination by the Companys board of directors that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 6.3(e) and Section 6.3(f), neither the board of
directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or
indirectly, (A) (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in the case of
any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to
recommend against such Acquisition Proposal, or fail to confirm the Board
Recommendation, within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) in the case of any publicly announced
Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to
issue a press release confirming the Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days following Parents written request to the board of directors of
the Company that the board of directors of the Company issue such press
release (provided the board of directors shall not be required to issue more
than one such press release in response to any Acquisition Proposal), or (v)
make any public statement that is inconsistent with the Board Recommendation
(it being understood that a statement to the effect that the board of
directors of the Company is

 



      
 

 



 

considering an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement and its fiduciary duties and confirming the Board
Recommendation shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation) (any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) being
referred to as a "Change of Recommendation") or (B) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar agreement,
arrangement, or understanding (i) constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting,
the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under
applicable Law, make a Change of Recommendation unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation
proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.3(f)) in response to an
Intervening Event; _provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) the Company has provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice must specify
the reasons for proposing to take such action, and include a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event; and

 



 

(ii) Parent shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would be binding
on Parent and that has not been withdrawn, within three (3) Business Days
(during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding any proposal by Parent)
after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such manner that would obviate the
need for the Companys board of directors to effect such Change of
Recommendation.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting,
the Companys board of directors may, if the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under
applicable Law, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) the Company has provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice must specify
the reasons for taking such action and, a written copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the party making such potential Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, the identity of such party and a summary description of the material
terms and conditions of such potential Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) Parent shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would be binding
on Parent and that has not been withdrawn, within three (3) Business Days
(during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding any proposal by Parent)
after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any revisions to the
Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or mix of
consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of such
potential Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to provide Parent
with notice of such material amendment and there shall be a new two (2)
Business Day period following such notification during which the Company shall
negotiate with Parent and otherwise comply again with the requirements of this
Section 6.3(f) and the board of directors of the Company shall not make a
Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any such period as so extended.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such disclosure referred to in
clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation unless (x) the board of directors of the Company
expressly reaffirms the Board Recommendation in such disclosure or (y) such
disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this Section 6.3(g) shall not be deemed to
permit the Companys board of directors to make a Change of Recommendation or
to take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.3(e) or Section 6.3(f),
except, in each case, to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.3(e) or
Section 6.3(f), as applicable.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed
as of the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ "), for a period of 12 months
following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during an Employees period of
employment or December 31, 2016), Parent agrees to provide or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide (i) each
Employee with (x) a base salary or wage rate and (y) aggregate incentive
compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than the base salary or
wage rate and aggregate incentive compensation opportunity in effect for such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (but without any requirement
to provide comparability for any equity or cash awards granted in connection
with or anticipation of the Merger or with any change of

 



      
 

 



 

control or retention features or as new hire awards), and (ii) the Employees
as a whole with employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those in effect for the Employees on the date hereof (excluding
any change in control or retention benefits, defined benefit plans, and post-
employment welfare benefits). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as conferring, or intending to confer, on any
Employee a right to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. This Section 6.4 shall not apply
with respect to individuals covered by collective bargaining agreements or
other collective representations, in which case the terms of the applicable
collective bargaining agreement or collective representation shall apply, or
(other than with respect to equity-based incentive compensation) with respect
to individuals subject to non-United States law, in which case Parent agrees
to comply with any applicable laws or employment agreements with respect to
compensation and benefits.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all material Benefit Plans and material Foreign
Benefit Plans.

 



 

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, service-based accrual rates of and entitlement to
benefits (including without limitation severance plans and arrangements),
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service
with Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall take
commercially reasonable steps to waive eligibility waiting periods and pre-
existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not included under the
corresponding Benefit Plan providing medical coverage, for purposes of the
first plan year ending after the Closing Date. Parent agrees to take
commercially reasonable steps to give or cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to give the Employees credit under the applicable
Parent Plan (in the first such Parent Plan year ending after the Effective
Time) for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Plan.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will in good faith
discuss the development of retention programs in connection with the Employees
continuing employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the
Effective Time.

 



 

(e) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
have received evidence that the Company has terminated, if and to the extent
requested by Parent, the Benefit Plan intended to comply with Section 401(k)
of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") and any other Benefit Plan or
other similar Contract maintained by the Company in each case as identified on
_Schedule 6.4(e)_ , in a form and on terms and timing reasonably satisfactory
to Parent (and, with respect to the Company 401(k) Plan, prospectively
effective no later than the day before the Effective Time).

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.4 with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall
not create any direct or third party beneficiary right (i) in any other
Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or any
beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Parent Plans,
or (ii) to continued employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent or prohibits Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be approved by
each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor Parent
(nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release
or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior review and approval of the
other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making
any such public announcements; _provided_ , that the Company will not be
required to obtain the prior approval of or consult with the other party in
connection with any such press release or public announcement if (a) the
Companys board of directors has effected a Change of Recommendation pursuant
to Section 6.3(e), (b) in connection with any such press release or public
announcement pursuant to Section 6.3(f), or (c) such press release or public
announcement consists solely of information previously disclosed in all
material respects in a previously distributed press release or public
announcement.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and by the by-laws of the Company or any
applicable Subsidiary, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and the by-laws of the Company or any applicable Subsidiary.
After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all rights to exculpation or
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
existing as of the Effective Time in favor of directors and officers of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors in their capacity as

 



      
 

 



 

officers or directors, and the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and
administrators of such officer or director (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as
provided in the Companys or each of its Subsidiaries respective certificate
of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational or governing
documents) or in any agreement, shall survive the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor
such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained
in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6) year period, such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company
pay, and in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
pay, an aggregate premium for any such insurance policy or policies in excess
of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premium of such policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance
carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies, or
(ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the DandO
Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than
the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and _provided further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth in reasonable detail a description of the Companys DandO Insurance
existing as of the date hereof, including the annual premium for such DandO
Insurance.

 



 

(c) This Section 6.6 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party or DandO
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.6.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law, its organizational documents and Nasdaq Rules to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ "),
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting only if and to the extent
the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Parent, that (i)
the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
by applicable Law or a written request from the SEC or its staff and the
Company uses its commercially reasonable efforts to hold or resume the Company
Stockholder Meeting as soon as practical, (ii) it is required by applicable
Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to give its
stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that
the Company has sent to its stockholders;, (iii) the Company reasonably
believes that it will not have enough shares of Common Stock represented to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholder Meeting or (iv) the Company reasonably believes that it will not
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _further_ that (x)
nothing in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall permit any postponement or
adjournment to a date on or after ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Termination Date and (y) subject to the foregoing clause (x), the Company
shall be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
pursuant to clause (iv) only once and only for up to fifteen (15) Business
Days.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (i) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement
relating to the Merger and this Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") (it
being understood that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

occur prior to the end of an Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) ("
_Offering Period_ "), the Company shall take action to provide for an earlier

assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding. Parent shall at
times ensure that there will remain a sufficient amount of unissued shares of
Parent Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations in connection with
the Company Performance Restricted Stock Units, Company Restricted Stock Units

Company) or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) that are
related to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
transaction litigation brought by a stockholder of the Company or Parent, as
applicable). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence of any
event, which would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality to not be true and accurate in any respect as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such representation
or warranty that is not so qualified to not be true and accurate in any
material respect as if such representation were made at such time, or (ii) the
Company or Parent, as applicable, to fail to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such notification

warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to arrange
and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms thereof (including any "market
flex" provisions) including using its reasonable best efforts to seek to
enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach
thereof by the financing provider(s) thereunder. Parent shall not, without the
Companys prior written consent, permit any amendment, supplement, replacement
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement, replacement, modification or
waiver (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the cash proceeds from the Debt
Financing or (B) imposes new or additional conditions to the initial funding
or otherwise expands any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the
Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x)
delay or prevent the funding in full of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date, or (y) adversely
affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (
_provided_ , that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true,
complete and correct copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, use
its reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter (provided that the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented,
replaced, modified or waived as provided in this Section 6.13), (B) to
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_
") on the terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to
Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) to satisfy on a
timely basis (or obtain the waiver of), and in a manner that will not impede
the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger, all conditions to receipt
of the full amount of the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein that
are within its control or subject to its influence and, upon satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing, (D) to comply with its obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letter, and (E) to consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that all conditions precedent
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have been or, upon funding
of the Debt Financing will be, satisfied, Parent and Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to enforce their rights under, and cause the Financing
Sources, lenders and the other persons providing or committing to provide the
Debt Financing to comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter and definitive financing agreements and to fund on or before the
Effective Time the Debt Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing, and, promptly following request by the Company, provide to
the Company copies of all executed Debt Financing Agreements.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior
to the Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is terminated for any
reason, (ii) Parent becomes aware of any breach or default (A) by any
Financing Source party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Agreement or (B) any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt
Financing Agreement if, in the case of this clause (B), such breach or default
would reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Debt Financing
or (iii) a counterparty indicates in writing or orally that it will not
provide, or it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein.
Parent shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstances referred to in this Section 6.13(c).
Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any
transaction that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or
prevent consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing.

 



 

(d) Parent shall have the right to substitute the net cash proceeds received
by Parent after the date hereof and prior to the Closing from consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) by Parent for all or
any portion of the Debt Financing by reducing commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that (v) such offering or other incurrence of debt
does not result in a breach or default under, or violation of, the Debt
Commitment Letter, (w) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing committed
under the Debt Commitment Letter following such reduction, together with other
cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (x) the proceeds of such debt offerings or other
incurrences have been received by Parent in cash, (y) Parent promptly notifies
the Company of such substitution and reduction and (z) true, correct and
complete copies of each material amendment or modification to the Debt
Commitment Letter relating thereto will be promptly provided to the Company.
If commitments under the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter have been reduced to zero in connection with the preceding
sentence, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 6.14 shall no longer be in effect. Further, Parent shall have the
right to substitute commitments in respect of other financings for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources so long as the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, together with
other cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and all conditions precedent to funding of such financing
are, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent to (or more favorable to
the Company than) the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, to supplement or replace the Debt Financing (" _Alternative Debt_
_Financing_ "). True, correct and complete copies of each alternative
financing commitment in respect of such Alternative Debt Financing (each, a "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), together with all related fee letters and
associated engagement letters (solely in the case of the fee letter, with only
the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms
that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or
conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of proceeds available under, the
Debt Financing contained therein redacted), will be promptly provided to the
Company. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter which
is not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and
each New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (iii) any
reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee
letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded by any
New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and each New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



 

(e) On the Closing Date, Parent shall provide all funds required to effect the
repayment of all indebtedness under the Company Credit Agreement in full in
accordance with the Company Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with
Section 6.14(a)(iii).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parents
obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parents or any
of its Affiliates obtaining funds to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.(a) (a) Subject to 6.14(b) and (c), prior
to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and their
officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting
advisors to, provide, at Parents sole cost and expense, to Parent all
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Financing, including (i) participation by senior management in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, and due diligence sessions at
times and locations mutually agreed and reasonably coordinated in advance
thereof as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) reasonably
assisting with the preparation of materials (to the extent relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries) for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, lender

 



      
 

 



 

presentations, and similar marketing documents to be used in connection with
the Debt Financing, including such information and data related to the Company
and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably required by Parent for Parent to produce
the financial statements and information identified in paragraphs 4 and 5 of
Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter and (iii) obtaining customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge in respect of the
payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all obligations under
the Company Credit Agreement, including releases of liens relating thereto, in
each case as reasonably requested by Parent.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit
the taking of any action to the extent it would (1) interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (2)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates to pay (or agree to pay) any fees, or reimburse any expenses prior
to the Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed, or otherwise incur any
other obligations or give any indemnities prior to the Closing that are not
contingent on the Closing, (3) cause any representation or warranty or
covenant in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (4) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (5) conflict with the
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Laws, (6) result in the contravention or breach of, or default under, any
Material Contract, (7) provide access to or disclose information that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (8) prepare
separate financial statements for any Subsidiary of the Company or change any
fiscal period; or (y) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors or officers shall be obligated to adopt resolutions
or execute consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that this clause (y) shall not prohibit the adoption or
execution of any resolutions or consents effective no earlier than the Closing
Date by any persons that shall remain or will become officers or directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time; and (z) any
documentation executed by the Company of any of its Subsidiaries shall not
become effective until the Effective Time. Parent shall (1) promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, as applicable, in
connection with the Debt Financing and providing the assistance contemplated
by this Section 6.14 and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "
_Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith or
providing the assistance contemplated by this Section 6.14, in each case other
than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct of such Financing Indemnitee, as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (the obligations of
Parent in this clause (2), the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The
Financing Cooperation Indemnity shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and any termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or any of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Affiliates
or Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, other than
with respect to any litigation where Parent is adverse to the Company, the
Company will give Parent the reasonable opportunity, at Parents sole cost and
expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in
(but not control) the defense of any action, claim, suit or proceeding against
the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement will be agreed to or
offered without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to consent to any settlement (i) which does not include full
release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), or (ii) that would result in the
payment by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any amount in
excess of the retention or deductible under any applicable insurance policy of
the Company. Subject to applicable Law, other than with respect to any
litigation where the Company is adverse to Parent, Parent will give the
Company the reasonable opportunity, at the Companys sole cost and expense, to
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in (but not
control) the defense or settlement of any action, claim, suit or proceeding
against Parent or its directors or officers relating to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the consummation of the Merger,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not settle any
action, claim, suit or proceeding related to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby unless such settlement provides a full and unconditional
release for the Company and each officer and director of the Company party to
such litigation. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their

(c) Parent shall have received a certificate signed by an authorized officer

which event such representation or warranty shall be true and correct only as

the case of this clause (ii), where the failure to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality", "Parent Material

or Section 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused
by a material breach of this Agreement by such party, or in the case of Parent
or Sub, by either Parent or Sub.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred at or prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York

obligations under Section 6.8(a), or (y) Parent or Sub is seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) and the Governmental Entity

warranty such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) would not be
satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination is the Closing Date);

prior to the Effective Time; or

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Sub,
or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Sub shall be untrue, in any

would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination is the
Closing Date); _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably capable of being
cured by Parent and Sub through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts
during the forty-five (45) day period following notification by the Company to
Parent of such breach or inaccuracy and Parent and Sub continue to exercise
such reasonable best efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(c)(i) prior to the expiration of such period; _provided
further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

 



      
 

 



 

8.1(c)(i) shall not be available to the Company if it has failed to perform in
any material respect any of its obligations under or in connection with this
Agreement or is in breach of any representation or warranty such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) would not be satisfied (assuming that
the date of such determination is the Closing Date);

 



 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if all of the

Section 6.3; (C) the board of directors of the Company approves, and the
Company substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement,
enters into, a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
and (D) prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays to the Parent the amounts contemplated by Section 8.2(b); or

 



 

(d) by Parent:

 



 

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue, in any case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would
not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination is the Closing
Date); _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably capable of being cured
by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts during the
forty-five (45) day period following notification by Parent to the Company of
such breach or inaccuracy and the Company continues to exercise such
reasonable best efforts, Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(d)(i) prior to the expiration of such period; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(d)(i) shall not be available to Parent if it has failed to perform in any
material respect any of its obligations under or in connection with this
Agreement or is in breach of any representation or warranty such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied (assuming that
the date of such determination is the Closing Date); or

 



 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if either of
the following occur: (A) if a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or

Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made (other than in the case of termination pursuant to Section
8.1(a)), and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there
shall be no damages or liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company

 



      
 

 



 

or their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Sub
and the Company, the obligations pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement,
this Section 8.2, and Article IX. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall
relieve Parent, Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or a Knowing and
Intentional Breach of this Agreement and, if it shall be judicially determined
that termination of this Agreement was caused by fraud or a Knowing and
Intentional Breach, then, in addition to other remedies at law or equity for
such fraud or Knowing and Intentional breach, the party so found to have
committed fraud or Knowingly and Intentionally breached this Agreement shall
indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the other parties for their respective
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of their counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, and other experts and advisors as well as
fees and expenses incident to negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement and related documentation and stockholders meetings and consents.

 



 

(b) If, but only if,

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), or

 



 

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company (1)
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) (but only if at such time Parent would not be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement by the first proviso in Section
8.1(b)(i)) without a vote of the Companys stockholders being taken, or (2)
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), (B) there has been received after the date of
this Agreement and not withdrawn or publicly disclosed prior to the
termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (A)(1) or there has been
publicly disclosed for the first time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting in the case of clause
(A)(2), an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, either (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Qualifying Transaction, which is subsequently consummated, or (2)
a Qualifying Transaction is consummated,

 



 

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of seventy million
dollars ($70,000,000) in cash,

 



 

(x) concurrently with any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii);

 



 

(y) within three (3) Business Days following any termination pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii); and

 



 

(z) within three (3) Business Days after the consummation of a Qualifying
Transaction following a termination of this Agreement under the circumstances
set forth in Section 8.2(b)(ii);

 



 

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
fee referred to in this Section 8.2(b) on more than one occasion. Upon payment
of such fee, the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

have no further liability to Parent or Sub with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
release any party from liability for fraud or a Knowing and Intentional Breach
of this Agreement. All payments contemplated by this Section 8.2(b) shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. If the Company
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, or any
portion thereof, (i) such amount or portion shall accrue interest from the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment at the
Prime Rate in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus
five percent (5%) and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent or Sub its out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with any
suit that results in a judgment against the Company in respect of the amount
set forth in Section 8.2 or any portion thereof.

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof

subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be included in each other section or subsection of such
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule to which the
relevance of such information would be reasonably apparent on the face thereof
without further inquiry. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any
standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever. References to "$",
"dollar", or "dollars" are to the lawful currency of the United States.

agreement.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
exhibits and instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement
(a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, (b) are not intended to confer upon any Person or any
of their respective successors and permitted assigns, other than the parties
hereto, any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except for (i)
prior to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, the
rights of Company stockholders to pursue claims for damages based on loss of
the economic benefits of the transaction to the stockholders of the Company in
the event of Parents or Subs fraud or Knowing and Intentional Breach of this
Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Sub,
and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, as provided in this Section 9.6
and in Section 6.6 (which is intended for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties and the DandO Indemnitees) and in Section 6.14 (which is intended for
the benefit of the Financing Indemnitees); _provided_ , that each of the
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of the first
proviso in Section 9.1 (Amendment and Modification), Section 9.8(b) (Governing
Law), Section 9.9(b) (Jurisdiction), Section 9.11(b) (Specific Performance;
Remedies), Section 9.16 (Waiver of Jury Trial) and this proviso in this
Section 9.6, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources and each of the Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely
on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. The rights granted pursuant
to the foregoing clause (i) of this Section 9.6 shall be enforceable on behalf
of the stockholders of the Company only by the Company in its sole and
absolute discretion, as agent for the stockholders of the Company, it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in any claims arising
therefrom shall attach to such shares of Company Common Stock and subsequently
transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other
amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims (net
of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the
Companys sole and

 



      
 

 



 

absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any date
determined by the Company or (B) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company
deems fit.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. (a) This Agreement and all litigation, claims,
actions, suits, hearings or proceedings (whether civil, criminal or
administrative and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or
indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Sub or
the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
hereof or thereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any and all
claims or causes of action (whether civil, criminal or administrative and
whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising
out of or relating to the Debt Financing (including any claim, controversy or
dispute against or involving any Financing Source, including their respective
successors and permitted assigns) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as otherwise
provided in the Debt Commitment Letter), without giving effect to any choice
of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York; _provided,_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any proceeding
with respect to the Debt Financing, any Financing Source or the Debt
Commitment Letter involving (a) the interpretation of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect" (and whether or not a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred), (b) the determination of the accuracy of any
Specified Merger Agreement Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent and/or Sub
have the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement or decline to
consummate the Merger and (c) the determination of whether the Merger has been
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any United States federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state

 



      
 

 



 

court) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court); _provided_ ,
that each of the parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any United States federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in any
other court or jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties hereto will bring, or
support, any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, anywhere other than in (i) any New York
State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or (ii) the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in Section 9.9 in any such action or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by mailing copies thereof by
registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.3. However, the foregoing
shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other
party by any other legally available method.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. (a) The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements
and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are
necessary on its part to consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable injury
to the non-breaching parties, for which damages, even if available, will not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the granting
of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, and to compel performance of such partys obligations (including the
taking of such actions as are required of such party to consummate the
Merger), this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled under this Agreement. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which a party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Company
Related Party (other than Parent and Sub) shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing
Source shall have any rights or claims against any Company Related Party
(other than Parent or Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the

 



       
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, following the Closing and the
consummation of the Debt Financing, the foregoing will not limit any rights
the Financing Sources have against the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that the Parent and/or Sub may assign
this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
without the consent of the Company; _provided_ that Parent and/or Sub, as the
case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. Any assignment in violation of
this Section 9.12 shall be null and void.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby is consummated.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 



 

Section 9.16 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE) ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DEBT FINANCING AND ANY RELATED COMMITMENT
LETTER OR FEE LETTER RELATED THERETO) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH

 



      
 

 



 

PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.16.

 



 

 _[Remainder of page intentionally left blank.]_

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Parent and Sub have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first written above.
