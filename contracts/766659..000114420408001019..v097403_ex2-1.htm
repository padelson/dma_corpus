incorporation, and has the requisite  power  to carry on its business as now
conducted.

 



 

2.2  _Capitalization_.  The  authorized share capital of PSI consists of
10,000 ordinary shares, of which  at  the Closing, no more than 10,000
shares shall be issued and outstanding. All  of  the issued and outstanding

as a company and is in good standing under the  laws of the British Virgin
Islands, and in each other jurisdiction in which  the  ownership of its
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be  so  qualified,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material 
Adverse Effect on PSI's financial condition, results of operations or
business.  PSI has full corporate power and authority and all authorizations,
licenses  and  permits necessary to carry on the business in which it is
engaged and to own  and  use the properties owned and used by it.

 



 

2.4  _Authority  Relative to this Agreement_.  PSI has  the requisite
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry  out  its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this 
Agreement by PSI and the consummation by PSI of the transactions
contemplated  hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of
PSI and no other  actions on the part of PSI are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly  executed and delivered by PSI and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement  of  PSI, enforceable against PSI in accordance with its
terms, except as such  enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar laws  affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights

2.5  _Consents  and Approvals; No Violations_.  Except  for applicable
requirements of federal securities laws and state securities  or  blue-sky
laws, no filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval  of,
any third party, public body or authority is necessary for the consummation 
by PSI of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the
execution  and delivery of this Agreement by PSI nor the consummation by PSI
of the  transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by PSI with any of
the  provisions hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of
any  provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of PSI, (b)
result  in a  violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse  of  time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of

conditions or provisions of any note,  bond, mortgage, indenture, license,
contract, agreement or other instrument  or  obligation to which PSI is a
party or by which they any of their respective  properties or assets may be
bound or (c) violate any order, writ, injunction,  decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to PSI, or any of its properties  or assets, except in
the case of clauses (b) and (c) for violations, breaches  or  defaults which

the Company prior to the Closing fully  and  fairly reflect the transactions
to which PSI is a party or by which it or its  properties are bound and there
shall be no material difference between the  unaudited financials of PSI
given to the Company and the actual reviewed US  GAAP  results of PSI for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2007.

 



 

2.7  _Intellectual  Property_.  PSI has  no knowledge of any claim that,
or inquiry as to whether, any product, activity  or operation of PSI

proprietary rights of any other person, corporation or other entity;  and no
proceedings have been instituted, are pending or are threatened. 

 



 

2.8  _Litigation_.  PSI is  not subject to any judgment or order of any
court or quasi-judicial or  administrative agency of any jurisdiction,
domestic or foreign, nor is there  any  charge, complaint, lawsuit or
governmental investigation pending against PSI.  PSI is not a plaintiff in
any action, domestic or foreign, judicial or  administrative. There are no
existing actions, suits, proceedings against or  investigations of PSI, and
PSI knows of no basis for such actions, suits,  proceedings or
investigations. There are no unsatisfied judgments, orders,  decrees or
stipulations affecting PSI or to which PSI is a party.

parties thereto. No notice of default or similar notice has been  given or
received by PSI under any of such Material Contracts.

 



 

2.11  _Disclosure_.  The  representations and warranties and statements of

where  such noncompliance could not have or reasonably be expected to result

(n) _Regulatory  Permits_.  The  Company possesses all certificates,
authorizations and permits issued by the  appropriate federal, state, local

businesses as described in the SEC Reports, except  where the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably  be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the  **" Intellectual  Property
Rights"**).  No  Existing Company Entity has received a written notice that

or such  employee or, to the knowledge of the Company, any entity in which
any officer,  director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is
an officer,  director, trustee or partner. The Energroup Parties do not owe
any money or  other compensation to any of the respective officers or
directors or  shareholders of the Company. The Company has no present
obligations, agreements  or dealings with any past or present customer.

 

 

(s) _Internal  Accounting Controls_.  The  Company maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide  reasonable assurance that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with  management's general or
specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded  as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with  GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted  only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv)  the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets  at 
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any 
differences. The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures 
(as  defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for itself and
designed  such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information  relating to the Company is made known to the certifying officers
by others  within those entities, particularly during the period in which the
Company's  Form 10-KSB or 10-QSB, as the case may be, is being prepared. The
Company's  certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's controls  and procedures in accordance with Item 307 of Regulation
S-B under the Exchange  Act for the Company's most recently ended fiscal
quarter or fiscal year-end  (such date, the **" Evaluation  Date"**). 
The  Company presented in its most recently filed Form 10-KSB or Form 10-QSB
the  conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the
disclosure  controls and procedures based on their evaluations as of the
Evaluation Date.  Since the Evaluation Date, there have been no significant
changes in the  Company's internal controls (as such term is defined in Item
308(c) of  Regulation S-B under the Exchange Act) or, to the Company's
knowledge, in other  factors that could significantly affect any of the
Company's internal  controls.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(t) _Solvency_.  Based  on the financial condition of the Company, as of the
Closing Date (and assuming  that the Closing shall have occurred), (i) the 
Company's  fair  saleable value of their respective assets exceeds the
amount that will be  required to be paid on or in respect of the Company's
existing debts and other  liabilities (including known contingent
liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the  Company's assets do not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on their  respective business for the
current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed  to be conducted
including its capital needs taking into account the particular  capital
requirements of the business conducted by the Company, and projected  capital
requirements and capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current  cash
flow of the Company, together with any proceeds that the Company would 
receive (exclusing the proceeds from the Financing), were the Company to 
liquidate all of its respective assets, after taking into account all 
anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or 
in  respect of its debt when such amounts are required to be paid. The
Company  does  not intend to incur debts beyond its respective ability to
pay such debts as  they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of
cash to be payable  on  or in respect of its debt).

 

 

(u) _Certain  Fees_.  Except  as described in _Schedule  4.1(u)_ ,  no 
brokerage or finder's fees or commissions are or will be payable by the

transactions  contemplated under this Agreement.

representations and warranties of PSI and the  PSI  Shareholders set forth

Shareholders under this Agreement. The Company is eligible to register  its
common stock for resale by the investors acquiring shares under the 
Securities Purchase Agreement under Form S-1 promulgated under the
Securities  Act. Except as specified in _Schedule  4.1(v)_ ,  the  Company
has not granted or agreed to grant to any Person any rights (including 
"piggy-back" registration rights) to have any securities of the Company 
registered with the Commission or any other governmental authority that have 
not  been satisfied.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(w) _Listing  and Maintenance Requirements_.  Except  as specified in the
SEC Reports, the Company has not, in the two years preceding  the date
hereof, received notice from any Trading Market to the effect that  the 
Company is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements 
thereof. The Company is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in
the  foreseeable future continue to be, in compliance with the listing and 
maintenance requirements for continued listing of its common stock on the 
Trading Market on which its common stock is currently listed or quoted. The 
issuance of the Energroup Shares does not contravene the rules and
regulations  of the Trading Market on which its common stock is currently
listed or quoted,  and no approval of the shareholders of the Company
thereunder is required for  the Company to issue and deliver the Energroup
Shares to the PSI Shareholders  under this Agreement.

of, and immediately following the  Closing will not have become, an
"investment company" within the meaning of the  Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

 

 

(y) _Application  of Takeover Protections_.  The  Company has taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable  any control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including  any  distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision  under the
Company's Articles of Incorporation (or similar charter documents) or  the
laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to 
the  PSI Shareholders as a result of such shareholders and the Company
fulfilling  their obligations or exercising their rights under this
Agreement.

 

 

(z) _OFAC_.  The  Company, nor any of its directors, officers, agents,
employees, Affiliates  or  Persons acting on behalf of the Company, are not
currently subject to any U.S.  sanctions administered by the Office of
Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.  Treasury Department (" **OFAC** "). 

 

 

(aa) _Money  Laundering Laws_.  The  operations of the Company are and have
been conducted at all times in compliance  with the money laundering statutes
of applicable jurisdictions, the rules and  regulations thereunder and any
related or similar rules, regulations or  guidelines, issued, administered or
enforced by any applicable governmental  agency (collectively, the "
**Money  Laundering Laws** ")  and no  action, suit or proceeding by or
before any court or governmental agency,  authority or body or any arbitrator
involving the Company with respect to the  Money Laundering Laws is pending
or, to the best knowledge of the Company,  threatened.

 

 

(bb) _Registration  Rights_.  Except  for the registration rights provided
to the Energroup Shareholder in connection  with the transaction contemplated
under this Agreement, at the time of Closing  the Energroup Shareholder has
no registration rights or agreement with the  Company to provide any similar
rights.

 

 

4.2 _No  Liabilities_.  Except  as otherwise disclosed in the Company's
Financial Statements or incurred in the  ordinary course of business after
the quarter ended September 30, 2007 (the  financial statements of which were
filed with the SEC along with the Company's  quarterly report on Form 10-QSB
on November 1, 2007), the Company has no other  undisclosed liabilities
whatsoever, either direct or indirect, matured or  unmatured, accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise. The Company and the  Energroup Shareholder
represent that at the date of Closing, the Company shall  have no liabilities
or obligations whatsoever, either direct or indirect,  matured or unmatured,
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3  _Tax  Matters_.  Except  as disclosed in Schedule 4.3:

 



 

(a)  The  Company has duly filed all material federal, state, local and
foreign tax  returns required to be filed (if any) by or with respect to them
with the  Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authority, and
no extensions  with respect to such tax returns have been requested or
granted;

 



 

(b)  The  Company has paid, or adequately reserved against in the Company's
Financial  Statements, all material taxes due, or claimed by any taxing
authority to be  due, from or with respect to them (if any);

 



 

(c)  To  the  best knowledge of the Company, there has been no material
issue raised or  material adjustment proposed (and none is pending) by the
Internal Revenue  Service or any other taxing authority in connection with
any of the Company's  tax returns;

 



 

(d)  No  waiver  or extension of any statute of limitations as to any
material federal, state,  local or foreign tax matter has been given by or
requested from the Company;  and

therefore either be paid or adequately reserved against in  the  Company's
Financial Statements) only on the last date payment of such tax can be  made
without interest or penalties, whether such payment is due in respect  of 
estimated taxes, withholding taxes, required tax credits or any other  tax.

 



 

4.4  _Books  and Records_.  The  books and records of the Company
delivered to PSI and the PSI Shareholders  prior  to the Closing fully and
fairly reflect the transactions to which the Company  is  a party or by
which they or their properties are bound.

 



 

4.5  _Other  Agreements_.  The  Company has no material contracts,
leases, arrangements or commitments (whether  oral or written). The Company
is not a party to or bound by or affected by  any  contract, lease,

employment of any person; (b) collective bargaining with, or any 
representation of any employees by, any labor union or association; (c) the 
acquisition of services, supplies, equipment or other personal property; (d) 
the  purchase or sale of real property; (e) distribution, agency or
construction;  (f)  lease of real or personal property as lessor or lessee
or sublessor or  sublessee; (g) lending or advancing of funds; (h) borrowing
of funds or receipt  of credit; (i) incurring any obligation or liability; or
(j) the sale of  personal property.

 



 

4.6 _No  SEC  or NASD Inquiries_.  Neither  Energroup nor any of its past
or present officers or directors is, or has ever  been, the subject of any
formal or informal inquiry or investigation by the  SEC  or NASD.

fact made by the Energroup  Parties in this Agreement are, as applicable,
accurate, correct and complete  and  do not contain any untrue statement of

**ARTICLE  5**

 



 

**INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

5.1 _Energroup  Shareholder Indemnification_.  For a  period of twenty four
(24) months after the Closing, the Energroup Shareholder  ("Indemnifying
Party") agrees to indemnify PSI, the PSI Shareholders and each of  the
officers, agents and directors of PSI or the PSI Shareholders (each an 
"Indemnified Party") against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense 
(including, but not limited to, any and all expenses whatsoever reasonably 
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, 
commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever) (each, a "Claim") to which
it  or they may become subject arising out of or based on either (i) any
breach  of  or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties or
covenants or  conditions made by the Company and/or the Energroup Shareholder
herein in this  Agreement; or (ii) any and all liabilities arising out of or
in connection  with:  (A) any of the assets of the Company prior to the
Closing; or (B) the operations  of the Company prior to the Closing (the
"Energroup Shareholders  Indemnification"). During the period of the
Energroup Shareholders  Indemnification, if PSI or the PSI Shareholders shall
become reasonably aware  of  any Claim covered by this Section 5.1, and
while such Claim is unresolved,  PSI  shall have the right to issue stop
transfer instructions to its transfer agent  with respect to the the Company
shares held by the Indemnifying Party. 

 



 

5.2 _Indemnification  Procedures_.  If any  action shall be brought against
any Indemnified Party in respect of which  indemnity may be sought pursuant
to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party  shall  promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing, and the Indemnifying Party  shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own  choosing. Any
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel  in any
such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and 
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party 
except to the extent that the employment thereof has been specifically 
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, the Indemnifying Party has 
failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to
employ  counsel or in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such
separate  counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the
position of  the  Indemnifying Party and the position of such Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying  Party will not be liable to any Indemnified Party
under this Article 5 for  any  settlement by an Indemnified Party effected
without the Indemnifying Party's  prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;  or  to the extent, but only to the extent
that a loss, claim, damage or liability  is  attributable to any Indemnified
Party's indemnification pursuant to this Article  5.
