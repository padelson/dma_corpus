Section 2.3   _Organizational Documents_.

  



  

(a)   _New Liberty Holdco Organizational Documents_. Immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, New Liberty Holdco shall, and the
Company shall cause New Liberty Holdco to, amend the New Liberty Holdco

or winding-up.

Partnership_. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, (i) the Company shall
continue to be the general partner of the Partnership, until replaced in
accordance with applicable Law, and (ii) the Partnership Agreement as in

19

Governing Documents.

  



  

(e)   _Organizational Documents of Prologis Merger Sub_. At the
Topco Merger Effective Time, the articles of organization and operating

(a)   _Membership Interests of Company Merger Sub and Company
Common Shares and New Liberty Holdco Common Shares_. As of the Company Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of any Company Common Shares, shares of beneficial
interest of New Liberty Holdco or membership interests in Company Merger Sub,
the following shall occur:

  



  

(i)   _Membership Interests of Company Merger Sub_. Each
membership interest of Company Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable common share of beneficial
interest, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company as the surviving entity
of the Company Merger.

  



  

(ii)   _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one (1) newly issued
common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.001 per share, of New
Liberty Holdco (a "New Liberty Holdco Common Share"). As a result of
the Company Merger, all Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate (or book-entry share) previously evidencing Company
Common Shares shall thereafter represent the New Liberty Holdco Common Shares
into which such Company Common Shares were converted (and, following the Topco
Merger Effective Time, shares of Parent Common Stock into which such New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares will be converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_).

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(iii)   _Conversion of Rights to Redeem or Exchange Partnership
Units_. Each right of a limited partner in the Partnership to redeem or
exchange its Partnership Units for Company Common Shares (or cash equivalents
thereof) pursuant to the Partnership Agreement outstanding immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the
right to redeem or exchange such Partnership Units for a number of New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares (or cash equivalents thereof) equal to the
number of Company Common Shares that such limited partner would have received
if the redemption or exchange occurred immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, as such number of shares may be adjusted and on the
terms pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.

  



  

(b)   _New Liberty Holdco Common Shares and Membership Interests
of Prologis Merger Sub_. As of the Topco Merger Effective Time, by virtue of
the Topco Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of
beneficial interest of New Liberty Holdco or any membership interests in
Prologis Merger Sub, the following shall occur:

  



  

(i)   _Conversion of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares_.
Subject to _Section 3.6_, each New Liberty Holdco Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time, other than

receive 0.675 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the  "Merger Consideration"),
without interest, but subject to any withholding required under applicable tax
Law, plus the right, if any, to receive pursuant to _Section 3.8_, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Fractional Share
Consideration") into which such New Liberty Holdco Common Shares would have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)(i)_. All New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a

applicable, formerly evidencing Company Common Shares as of immediately prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time) shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such New Liberty Holdco Common Shares, except, in all cases, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance
with this _Section 3.1(b)(i)_, including the right, if any, to receive the
Fractional Share Consideration, together with the amounts, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_.

Units_. Each right of a limited partner in the Partnership to redeem or
exchange its Partnership Units for New Liberty Holdco Common Shares (or cash
equivalents thereof) pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ shall be
automatically converted into the right to redeem or exchange such Partnership
Units for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash equivalents
thereof) equal to the product of the number of New Liberty Holdco Common
Shares that such limited partner would have received if the redemption or
exchange occurred immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, as such number of shares may be adjusted
and on the terms pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(iii)   _Cancelation of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares_. Each New
Liberty Holdco Common Share owned by any of the Company Parties or any wholly
owned Company Subsidiary and each New Liberty Holdco Common Share owned by any
of the Parent Parties or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries,
in each case, as of immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective
Time, shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(iv)   _Membership Interests of Prologis Merger Sub_. All
membership interests of Prologis Merger Sub issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding membership interests of Prologis Merger Sub.

this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect
the effect of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Shares, New Liberty Holdco Common Shares, Partnership OP Units, Partnership
Preferred Units, Parent Common Stock or Parent Partnership Units, as the case
may be), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company
Common Shares, New Liberty Holdco Common Shares, Partnership OP Units,
Partnership Preferred Units, Parent Common Stock or Parent Partnership Units,
as the case may be, outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Topco
Merger Effective Time and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, so as to provide the holders of Company Common Shares, New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares, Partnership OP Units and Partnership
Preferred Units with the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

Section 3.2   _Effect on Partnership Interests_. As of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Partnership OP Units,
Partnership Preferred Units or any membership interests in Prologis OP Merger
Sub, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a)   _Membership Interests of Prologis OP Merger Sub_. Each
membership interest of Prologis OP Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into and become one (1) new validly issued
Partnership OP Unit, and such Partnership OP Unit shall be owned by Parent OP.

  



  

(b)   _General Partner Interests in Partnership_. The general
partner interests in the Partnership as of immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (other than any Partnership OP Units or
Partnership Preferred Units held by the Company, which shall be converted
pursuant to clauses (c) and (d) of this _Section 3.2_) shall remain the
general partnership interests in the Partnership.

  



  

(c)   _Conversion of Partnership OP Units_. Each Partnership OP
Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into a number of new
validly issued Parent OP Units ("New OP Units") in an amount equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the "Partnership Merger Common Consideration"), and each
holder of Partnership OP Units shall be admitted as a limited partner of
Parent OP following the Partnership Merger Effective Time in accordance with
the terms of the Parent Partnership Agreement. No fractional New OP Units will
be issued in the Partnership Merger. Any fractional New OP Unit that would
otherwise be issued to any holder of Partnership OP Units shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole number and the holders of Partnership OP Units shall not
be entitled to any further consideration with respect thereto.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(d)   _Conversion of Partnership Preferred Units_. Each
Partnership Preferred Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall automatically be converted into
one (1) new validly issued New Preferred OP Unit (the "Partnership Merger
Preferred Consideration"), and each holder of Partnership Preferred Units
shall be admitted as a limited partner of Parent OP following the Partnership
Merger Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Parent Partnership
Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.3   _Effect on Equity-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Treatment of Company Equity Awards in Company Merger_. As
of the Company Merger Effective Time, each Company Equity Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into an equivalent equity award relating to an equal number of New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares (a "New Liberty Holdco Equity Award") and will
otherwise be subject to all of the same terms and conditions (including per
share exercise price, if applicable) that applied to such Company Equity
Award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards in Topco
Merger_. Immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time, any and all
outstanding issuance and forfeiture conditions on any New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards (recognizing and
taking into account that each such Company Restricted Stock Award was, at the
Company Merger Effective Time, converted into an equivalent New Liberty
Holdco Equity Award in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_ ) shall be deemed
satisfied in full, contingent upon the consummation of the Topco Merger, and
the holders of such New Liberty Holdco Common Shares will be entitled to
receive promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, after the
Topco Merger Effective Time the Merger Consideration in respect of each such
New Liberty Holdco Common Share, plus any Fractional Share Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.8_, less applicable Taxes and withholdings.

  



  

(c)   _Treatment of Company RSU Awards in Topco Merger_. Each
Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Merger
Effective Time (recognizing and taking into account that each such Company RSU
Award was, at the Company Merger Effective Time, converted into an equivalent
New Liberty Holdco Equity Award in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_ ) shall
vest in full and shall, as of the Topco Merger Effective Time, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled in
exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive promptly, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days, after the Topco Merger Effective Time a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or, in the case of a Company RSU
Award that is payable solely in cash by its terms, an amount in cash equal to
the VWAP of Parent Common Stock multiplied by a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock) equal to the product, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares, of (i) the number of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares subject to
such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, plus any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of _Section 3.8_, less applicable Taxes and withholdings. For
purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the number of shares shall
be determined, in the case of a Company RSU Award that is subject to
performance-based vesting conditions immediately prior to the Topco Merger
Effective Time, by deeming the applicable performance conditions to be
achieved based upon the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance conditions through the date that is the day immediately prior
to the Topco Merger Effective Time (except that, in the case of an award
granted in 2017, if the Topco Merger Effective Time occurs on or after
January 1, 2020, then the applicable performance conditions shall be deemed
achieved at the actual level of achievement during the completed performance
period).

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(d)   _Treatment of Company Options in Topco Merger_. At the
Topco Merger Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option
(recognizing and taking into account that each such Company Option was, at the
Company Merger Effective Time, converted into an equivalent New Liberty
Holdco Equity Award in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_ ) will terminate and
will be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive promptly,
and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, after the Topco
Merger Effective Time a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, determined
as of the Topco Merger Effective Time, equal to the quotient, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares, of (i)(A) the number of New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Topco Merger Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if any, of
the value of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
the Company Option, _divided by_ (ii) the VWAP of Parent Common Stock, plus
any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.8_, less applicable Taxes and
withholdings. For purposes of clause (i)(B) of the preceding sentence,
the value of the Merger Consideration shall equal the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ (y) the VWAP of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(e)   _Company Actions_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Company and Parent agree that the Company shall, and shall be
permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this  _Section 3.3_.

  



  

(f)   _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the
Company's Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), the
Company shall cause: (i) each outstanding offering period under the ESPP then-
in progress (an "Offering Period") as of the date of this Agreement to be the
final Offering Period under the ESPP (which shall end December 31, 2019),
(ii) the ESPP to be suspended such that no new Offering Periods shall begin on
or following the date of the Agreement, and (iii) the ESPP to terminate
immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time, and ensure that no
purchase or other rights under the ESPP enable the holder of such rights to
acquire any interest in Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Subsidiary as a
result of such purchase or the exercise of such rights at or after the Topco
Merger Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Topco Merger
Effective Time occurs in 2019, the Company shall cause (x) the current
Offering Period to terminate immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective
Time and be the final Offering Period under the ESPP, with no shares purchased
for such Offering Period, (y) the accumulated contributions of each ESPP
participant under the ESPP to be promptly returned to each such ESPP

Partnership OP Units or Partnership Preferred Units, except as otherwise
provided herein.

  



  

(ii)  From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be

after the Company Merger Effective Time, the holders of certificates (or
book-entry shares) evidencing ownership of the Company Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall
cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided
for herein. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, any
certificates or book-entry shares evidencing ownership of the Company

or any of their respective transfer agents for any reason shall be exchanged
as provided in this _Article III_ with respect to the Company Common Shares

Shares. From and after the Topco Merger Effective Time, the holders of

Effective Time presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company, New
Liberty Holdco or any of their respective transfer agents for any reason
shall be exchanged as provided in this _Article III_ with respect to the New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares formerly evidenced thereby.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Topco
Merger Effective Time (but, in any event, no later than three (3) Business
Days following the Topco Merger Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior
to the Topco Merger Effective Time represented outstanding New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)_: (i) a letter of
transmittal (a  "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), to the Exchange Agent, which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such
form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree upon, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of New Liberty
Holdco Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any amounts payable
in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.8_ and dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.4(e)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, together with such
Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_, plus any Fractional Share Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 3.8_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in
respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 3.4(e)_ to be mailed or delivered by wire
transfer, as soon as reasonably practicable following the later to occur of
(A) the Topco Merger Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agent's receipt
of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and such
Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
customary exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or a transfer of ownership of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of New Liberty Holdco, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.4_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at
any time after the Topco Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof).

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

(d)   _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares that
immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time represented outstanding
New Liberty Holdco Common Shares whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)_ shall not
be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to
the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration (or any amounts payable
in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)(i)_ or distribution to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.4(e)_) that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-
Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding New Liberty Holdco Common Shares whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_ shall automatically upon the Topco Merger Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Topco Merger Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)(i)_,
together with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.8_ and any distribution to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_ for each Book-Entry
Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and
distributions with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon the conversion of any Book-Entry
Share.

  



  

(e)   _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Topco Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or unsurrendered Book-Entry Share with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such
dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
hereunder in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or the conversion of such Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Topco Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Topco Merger Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(f)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any Fractional Share Consideration and any
applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock) which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares
for six (6) months after the Topco Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of New Liberty Holdco Common
Shares prior to the Topco Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration subject to
the terms and conditions of this _Article III_.

  



  

(g)   _No Liability_. None of the Parent Parties, the Company
Parties, the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person if any portion of the
Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of
such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h)   _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest the cash portion of the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Parent. Any
net profit resulting from, or interest or other income produced by, such
investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall
relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below
the level required to make prompt payments of any of the cash payments
contemplated by _Section 3.4(e)_ or _Section 3.8_, Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, replace or restore the portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments in accordance with _Section 3.4(e)_ and _Section 3.8_.

  



  

Section 3.5   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate (including,
for the avoidance of doubt for this purpose, certificates or book-entry
shares, as applicable, formerly evidencing Company Common Shares as of
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time) shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, to the
extent required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

Section 3.6   _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, each of
their respective Representatives and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and the
Fractional Share Consideration (and any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or deemed paid for Tax purposes), such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the
Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld
shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

Section 3.7   _Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights, or rights of objecting shareholders under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the
MGCL, shall be available with respect to the Mergers or other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any remedy under Section 3-201 et seq. of the
MGCL.

representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares or the conversion of New Liberty Holdco Equity
Awards pursuant to _Section 3.3_ , and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares or a New Liberty Holdco Equity Award
converted pursuant to the Topco Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Common
Stock.

  



  

Section 3.9   _Structure_. The Company Parties and the Parent
Parties shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate with, and reasonably and
in good faith consider any reasonable changes requested by, the Parent Parties
or the Company Parties, as applicable, regarding the structure of the
transactions contemplated herein (including with respect to the restructuring
transactions set forth in Section 7.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
including entering into appropriate amendments to this Agreement; _provided_
 that any such changes do not have an adverse effect on Parent, the Company,
their respective Subsidiaries or the holders of Company Common Shares,
including any adverse effect on the time by which the Mergers may be
consummated.

applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of its respective
properties or assets, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and

Section 4.7   _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Since January 1,
2017, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been, or is in,
violation of, or has been given written notice of or been charged with any
violation of, any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound (except for Laws addressed in _Section 4.12_, _Section 4.13_ or
_Section 4.21_, which shall be governed solely by such Sections), except for
any such violations that have been cured, or would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except for the Permits that are the subject of _Section 4.12_ and _Section
4.13_, which are addressed solely in those Sections, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has all permits, authorizations, approvals, registrations,
certificates, orders, waivers, clearances and variances (each, a
"Permit") necessary to conduct the Company's or a Company Subsidiary's
business, as applicable, substantially as it is being conducted as of the

Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Company's Knowledge, none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has received written notice that any Permit
will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, except which termination, modification or nonrenewal would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are valid and in
full force and effect and there are no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge,
threatened administrative or judicial Actions that would reasonably be
expected to result in modification, termination or revocation thereof, except
which modification, termination or revocation would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Company's Knowledge, since January 1, 2017,
the Company and each Company Subsidiary has been in material compliance with
the terms and requirements of such Permits.

(a) Each of the Company Parties has, since January 1, 2017,
filed with or otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the SEC on a
timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, registration statements,
definitive proxy statements and other documents required to be filed or
furnished by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the "Securities
Laws"), together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the  "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") (such documents,
together with any documents and information incorporated therein
by reference, collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), all of which were
prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities Laws. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (other
than preliminary materials) (i) complied (or with respect to Company SEC
Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) at the time of
filing or being furnished (or effectiveness in the case of registration
statements) did not (or with respect to Company SEC Reports filed after
the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements
have been modified or superseded by later Company SEC Reports filed with
or furnished to the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement and provided that no representation or warranty is made hereunder
as to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus that were not supplied by or on behalf of the
Company, New Liberty Holdco or the Partnership. Neither the Company, New
Liberty Holdco nor the Partnership has any outstanding and unresolved comments
from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of the
Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows,
as the case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP and the
applicable rules, accounting requirements and regulations of the SEC
consistently applied during the periods involved, except to the extent such
financial statements have been modified or superseded by later Company SEC
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement, and except, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act
and pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for normal year-
end audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or effect. With
the exception of the Partnership, no Company Subsidiary is required to file
any form or report with the SEC.

  



  

   

38

 



    



  

(b)  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including
any contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or such Company's or
Company Subsidiary's audited financial statements or other Company SEC
Reports.

  



  

(c) There are no liabilities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth
on the consolidated financial statements of the Company or the notes thereto,
other than liabilities (i) adequately provided for on the balance sheet of
the Company dated as of December 31, 2018 (including the notes thereto)
included in the Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) incurred under this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) incurred in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, subsequent to
December 31, 2018.

  



  

(d)  Since the end of the Company's most recent audited fiscal
year, there have been no significant deficiencies or material weakness in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not
remediated) and no change in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is not aware of any change in its internal control over financial
reporting that has occurred since December 31, 2018 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2017, (x) the
Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to the Company and required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, (i) to the Company's Knowledge, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company to
material information relating to the Company required to be included in the
reports the Company is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the
Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed to the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all known significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the
statements contained in all such certifications were, as of their respective
dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.

the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any of the Company Properties is
subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment, injunction, stipulation,
award or decree of any Governmental Authority that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

and complete in all material respects, and (ii) has timely paid (or had timely

investment trust" (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code
and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii)
has operated at all times since such date, and will continue to operate until
the Closing, in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT
for the taxable year that will end with the consummation of the Company

reasonably be expected to result in the Company's failure to qualify as a REIT
or a successful challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to

the Company, threatened.

  



  

(c)  The most recent financial statements contained in the
Company SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the

thereof through the date of such financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns.

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later Parent SEC
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement and provided that no representation or warranty is
made hereunder as to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form
S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that were not supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or the Parent OP. Neither Parent nor Parent OP has any outstanding
and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to Parent SEC Reports. Each

Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of Parent included in
or incorporated by reference into Parent SEC Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of

S-X under the Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act and for normal year-end audit adjustments which would not be
material in amount or effect. No Parent Subsidiary is required to file any
form or report with the SEC.

  



  

(b) None of Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Significant
Subsidiary is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or
arrangement, including any contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent, Parent OP and any Parent Significant
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Parent,
Parent OP or any Parent Significant Subsidiary, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such
contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent, Parent OP, any Parent Significant Subsidiary

dated as of December 31, 2018 (including the notes thereto) included in the
Parent SEC Reports filed with the SEC and publicly available prior to the

materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
Parent's internal control over financial reporting. Parent is not aware of
any change in its internal control over financial reporting that has occurred
since December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, Parent's internal control over financial reporting.
Since January 1, 2017, (x) Parent has designed and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, (i) to Parent's Knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of Parent to material information required to
be included in the reports Parent is required to file under the Exchange Act,
and (ii) Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed to Parent's independent registered public accounting
firm and the audit committee of Parent Board (A) all known significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parent's
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parent's internal controls over financial reporting. The
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the statements contained in
all such certifications were, as of their respective dates made, complete and
correct in all material respects.

(a)  As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, (i) each of the Parties hereto shall jointly prepare, and
cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Topco Merger (and, if required, with respect to the New
Liberty Holdco Common Shares issuable in the Company Merger), which will
include the preliminary Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii) Parent shall
prepare and cause to be submitted to the NYSE the application and other
agreements and documentation necessary for the listing of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Topco Merger on the NYSE. Each of the Parties hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as
necessary to complete the Mergers. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the application for the listing of the Parent
Common Stock accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable following
submission. Each of the Parties hereto shall furnish to any other Party any
and all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its
shares of beneficial interest or capital stock as may be required or
reasonably requested to be disclosed in the Form S-4 and in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the preparation and filing of the NYSE listing
application. The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the NYSE and of any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
from the NYSE for amendments or supplements to the NYSE listing application
or for additional information. Each Party shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
NYSE, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or with respect to
the NYSE listing application received from the NYSE and advise the other
Party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 received from the SEC or from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE
listing application. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and to any comments from the NYSE with respect to the
NYSE listing application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (1) filing
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC, or (2)
submitting the NYSE listing application to the NYSE or responding to any
comments of the NYSE, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments thereon made by the other Party or its counsel. Parent shall
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, (x) of the
time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Topco Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated and (y) of the time the NYSE listing application is
accepted. Parent shall take any other action required to be taken under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, NYSE rules and regulations, any applicable
foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
Topco Merger, and the Company shall furnish to Parent all information
concerning the Company and the Company's shareholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions. Parent shall also take any
other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, any applicable
foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the issuance of the New OP Units and New
Preferred OP Units in the Partnership Merger, and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company, the Partnership and the holders of
the Partnership OP Units and Partnership Preferred Units as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions. The Parent Parties shall have
the right, to the extent necessary (and following consultation with the
Company), to prepare and file a Form S-4 or any other registration form under
the Securities Act or Exchange Act with respect to the New OP Units and New
Preferred OP Units (the "OP Unit Form S-4") to be issued in connection with
the Partnership Merger. The Company Parties will cooperate in the preparation
of the OP Unit Form S-4 pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Parent Parties determine to prepare
and file the OP Unit Form S-4, (I) the Parent Parties shall prepare and cause
to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
determination, the OP Unit Form S-4, and (II) all references in this
Agreement to "Form S-4" (including this _Section 7.1_ and _Section 8.1(d)_)
shall be deemed to refer to the Form S-4 and the OP Unit Form S-4,
collectively.

(b)  If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, any event occurs with respect to the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Parent, Parent OP or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or
any change occurs with respect to other information to be included in the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which is required to be described
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other Party of such event and the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment
of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

  



  

(c)  As promptly as practicable following the date on which the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the Company's shareholders for the purpose of seeking the Company
Shareholder Approval (together with any adjournments or postponements thereof,
the "Company Shareholder Meeting"). The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company entitled
to vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting and to hold the Company Shareholder
Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company be required to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
prior to the thirty-fifth (35th) day following the date hereof. The Company
Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, unless a Change in Company Recommendation has occurred
in compliance with _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common
Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, the Company shall make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and
for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and votes in
favor of the Company Mergers; _provided_ , that the Company Shareholder
Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30)
days after the date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any postponement or adjournments required by
applicable Law) without the consent of Parent.

limiting the obligations under _Section 7.1_, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Parties and the Parent
Parties each shall (or shall cause their applicable Subsidiaries to) use
their commercially reasonable efforts to properly prepare and file any other
filings required under the Exchange Act or any other Law relating to the
Mergers (collectively, the "Other Filings"). Each of the Parties shall (and
shall cause their Affiliates to) promptly notify the other Parties of the
receipt of any comments on, or any request for amendments or supplements to,
any of the Other Filings by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or
official, and each of the Parties shall supply the other Parties with copies
of all correspondence between it and each of its Subsidiaries and
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the members of its staff or
any other appropriate governmental official, on the other hand, with respect
to any of the Other Filings, except, in each case, that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. Each of the Parties shall promptly obtain and furnish the other
Parties with (a) the information which may be reasonably required in order to
make such Other Filings and (b) any additional information which may be
requested by a Governmental Authority and which the Parties reasonably deem
appropriate; _provided_ that the Parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any sensitive materials provided to the other under this
_Section 7.2_ as "outside counsel only" (in which case such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, trustees or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the Party providing such materials). Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any request by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority or official for information, documents or other
materials in connection with the review of the Other Filings or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) provide to the other Party, and
permit the other Party to review and comment in advance of submission, all
proposed correspondence, filings, and written communications to the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority or official with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company
nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental
Authority.

Section 7.3   _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good
faith, and subject at all times to the Company's and its trustees' and
Parent's and its directors', as applicable, right and duty to act in a manner
consistent with their duties, each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Mergers and to
cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing, including the
taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any necessary or advisable
consents, approvals, orders, exemptions, waivers and authorizations by or
from (or to give any notice to) any public or private third party, including
any that are required to be obtained or made under any Law or any contract,
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
Parent, Parent OP or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, to defend all
lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers, to effect all necessary registrations and Other
Filings and submissions of information requested by a Governmental Authority,
and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely
affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the Mergers.

  



  

Section 7.4   _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

  



  

(a)  Except as expressly provided in this _Section 7.4_, from
and after the date hereof, the Company shall not, shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and trustees not
to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries' other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including
by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries, indications of
interest or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide any nonpublic information or data to any Person
relating to, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, proposals,
indications of interest or offers that constitute, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or execute or
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "Acquisition
Agreement"), or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not prohibit the Company or
its Representatives from informing any Third Party of the terms of this
_Section 7.4_ and referring such Third Party to any publicly-available copy
of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company Board shall be permitted to take the following actions,
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, in response to an unsolicited _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal by a Person made after the date of this
Agreement ( _provided_ that the Acquisition Proposal by such Person did
not result from a breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_) and which
the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) either constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties as trustees
under applicable Law: (A) engage in discussions and negotiations regarding
such Acquisition Proposal with the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal,
and (B) provide any nonpublic information or data to the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal after entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to taking
any of the actions described in the immediately preceding clause (A) and
clause (B), the Company must comply with its obligations under _Section
7.4(b)(ii)_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and must notify Parent
that it intends to take such action with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information or
data provided to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal prior to or
simultaneously with furnishing such information to such Person to the extent
such nonpublic information or data has not been previously provided to
Parent. For purposes of this _Section 7.4(b)_, an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and a counterparty, on the other hand, having
confidentiality and use provisions that are no more favorable as a whole to
such counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality
agreement shall not contain any standstill.

(ii)  The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally, and promptly thereafter in
writing, of the receipt by the Company, New Liberty Holdco, the Partnership,
the Company Board or any of their respective Representatives of any inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
indicate the identity of the Person making such inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer, and the material terms and conditions of,
such inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer (including a copy
thereof if in writing and any material documentation or correspondence that
sets forth any such terms). The Company shall (A) promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent, orally and promptly
thereafter in writing, of any changes or modifications to the material terms
of the Acquisition Proposal and (B) keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding material developments, discussions and negotiations
concerning any such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(iii)  Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv_) or _Section
7.4(b)(v)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof (nor the
board of trustees of New Liberty Holdco or any committee thereof) shall (A)
withhold or withdraw, or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the
Parent Parties, the Company Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal (or any transaction or series of related transactions
included within the definition of an Acquisition Proposal), (C) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (D) fail
to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D
promulgated under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or
recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing, (E) if an Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification thereof is made public or is otherwise sent to the
holders of Company Common Shares, fail to issue a press release or other
public communication that reaffirms the Company Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (F) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.4(b)(i)_), or (G) propose, resolve or agree to
take any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through (F) (any action
set forth in this _Section 7.4(b)(iii)_, a "Change in Company
Recommendation").

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(iv)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in
Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_, if and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ that the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_) is made to the Company and
is not withdrawn, (B) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company
Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with their
duties as trustees under applicable Law, (D) four (4) Business Days (the
"Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Company has given written
notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action
and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which Superior Proposal
Notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change in Company
Recommendation for any purpose of this Agreement, (E) during such Notice
Period, the Company has considered and, if requested by Parent, engaged and
caused its Representatives to engage in good faith discussions with
Parent regarding any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, and (F) the Company Board, following such
Notice Period, again concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties as trustees
under applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if, during
the Notice Period, any material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
(it being understood that a material revision shall include any change in the
purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal), the
Company Board shall give a new Superior Proposal Notice to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Notice Period and shall comply in all respects with the
requirements of this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ and the Notice Period shall
thereafter expire on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the
date of the delivery of such new Superior Proposal Notice ( _provided_ that
the delivery of a new Superior Proposal Notice shall in no event shorten the
four (4) Business Day duration applicable to the initial Notice Period) and
(2) in the event the Company Board does not determine in accordance with the
immediately preceding clause (F) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, but thereafter determines to make a Change in Company
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e_) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether from the same or different Person), the foregoing procedures and
requirements referred to in this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew prior
to the taking of any such actions.

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(v)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may make a Change in Company Recommendation (but only as set forth in
clauses (A) or (C) or, to the extent related to clauses (A) or (C), clause (G)
of _Section 7.4(b)(iii)_) if and only if (A) an Intervening Event has
occurred, (B) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with their duties as trustees under applicable Law, (C)
four (4) Business Days (the "Intervening Event Notice Period") shall have
elapsed since the Company has given written notice (which written notice
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change in Company Recommendation for
any purpose of this Agreement) to Parent advising that the Company intends to
take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
(D) during such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company has considered
and, if requested by Parent, engaged and caused its Representatives to engage
in good faith discussions with Parent regarding any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (E) the
Company Board, following such Intervening Event Notice Period,
again reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent)
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties as trustees
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Company
Board does not make such a Change in Company Recommendation following such
Intervening Event Notice Period, but thereafter determines to make such a
Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ in
circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing procedures
and requirements referred to in this _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ shall apply anew
prior to the taking of any such actions.

  



  

(vi)  Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit the
Company from (A) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 (a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) making any other disclosure to
its shareholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board reasonably
determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) is required by
applicable Law or (C) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure that addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation
unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly
states that the Company Recommendation has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of the Company, without disclosing any Change in Company
Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Board may not make a
Change in Company Recommendation unless in compliance with _Section
7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_.

  



  

(c)  Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that
it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives
to, (i) cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Third Parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate any such Third Party's
access to any physical or electronic data rooms and (iii) request that any
such Third Party and its Representatives (A) destroy or return all
confidential information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
and (B) destroy all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of
such Person that contain, reflect or analyze such confidential information,
in the case of the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), to the extent
required by and in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement between the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and such Person. The Company agrees that it will promptly inform
its and its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this _Section 7.4_. Any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 7.4_ by any officer, trustee, director or investment banker
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 7.4_ by the Company for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation,
unless such Change in Company Recommendation is with respect to a Superior
Proposal and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, the
Company shall cause the approval of the Company Mergers to be submitted to a
vote of its shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

  



  

(e)  Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), approval of the
Company Mergers is the only matter, other than any say-on-golden parachute
vote that may be required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in
the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by its shareholders at the
Company Shareholder Meeting.

  



  

(f)  The Company shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.5   _Officers ' and Trustees' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Topco Merger Effective Time, Parent (the
"Indemnifying Party") shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Topco
Merger Effective Time: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof, was previously, or is during any of the period from the date
hereof until the Topco Merger Effective Time, serving as a manager, director,
officer, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (for the avoidance of doubt, including New Liberty Holdco) and
acting in such capacity (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to
the fullest extent that a Maryland corporation is permitted to indemnify and
hold harmless its own such Persons under the applicable Laws of the State of
Maryland, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim with
respect to matters occurring on or before the Topco Merger Effective Time and
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in
respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to
the fullest extent that a Maryland corporation is permitted to indemnify and
hold harmless its own such Persons under the applicable Laws of the State of
Maryland, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but
subject to Parent's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Laws or any of the Company Governing Documents that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_
, that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Topco
Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting that indemnification is required in accordance with this
_Section 7.5_ with respect to a Claim, then the provisions for
indemnification contained in this _Section 7.5_ with respect to such Claim
shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Topco Merger Effective Time
and shall continue to apply until such time as such Claim is fully and
finally resolved. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination with respect to,
any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification may be
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Parties
from all liability arising out of such Claim. No Indemnified Party shall be
liable for any amounts paid in any settlement effected without its prior
express written consent.

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

(b)  Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parent Parties
agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees,
agents or fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Governing Documents and indemnification or similar
agreements of the Company shall survive the Topco Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or modified in a manner adverse to the Indemnified parties,
for a period of six (6) years following the Topco Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Topco Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting that indemnification is required in accordance with
this _Section 7.5_ with respect to a Claim, then the provisions for
indemnification contained in this _Section 7.5_ with respect to such Claim
shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Topco Merger Effective Time
and shall continue to apply until such time as such Claim is fully and
finally resolved.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
obtain and fully pay the premium for, and Parent shall maintain in full force
and effect (and the obligations under to be honored), during the six (6) year
period beginning on the date of the Topco Merger Effective Time, a "tail"
prepaid directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or policies
(which policy or policies by their respective express terms shall survive the
Mergers) from the Company's current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier, of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors' and
officers' liability policy or policies for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance for
Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Topco
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy exceed an amount
equal to 250% of the annual premium paid by the Company for its directors'
and officers' liability insurance as set forth in _Section 7.5(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (such amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If the
Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance described in the first
sentence of this _Section 7.5(c)_ for an amount equal to or less than the
Maximum Premium, the Company shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable
"tail" insurance as reasonably available for an aggregate cost equal to the
Maximum Premium.

  



  

   

83

 



    



  

(d)  If any of Parent or its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section 7.5_.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be
for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party and other Person referred to in this _Section 7.5_ (who are intended to
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs and
his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent and the Company, and shall not be amended in a manner that
is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns
and heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The
exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.5_ shall
be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or exculpation which an Indemnified Party and other Person
referred to in this _Section 7.5_ is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable
Law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

Section 7.6   _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a)  During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and contracts, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) furnish the Company or Parent, as applicable, with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business, properties, offices, books, contracts, records and personnel of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or Parent, Parent OP and Parent
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may
from time to time reasonably request, and (ii) with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and subject to the terms of the Company Leases,
facilitate reasonable access for Parent and its authorized Representatives
during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all
Company Properties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation
pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any of
the representations or warranties made by the Company Parties or the Parent
Parties, as applicable, hereto and all such access shall be coordinated
through the Company or Parent, as applicable, or its respective designated
Representatives, in accordance with such reasonable procedures as they may
establish. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required by this _Section 7.6_ to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of such other Party with access to or to disclose information
(A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a Third
Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice (if the Company or Parent, as applicable, has used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain permission or consent of such Third Party to such
disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or legal duty
of the Party or any of its Representatives ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law or legal duty), (C) that is
subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the disclosing Party
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not result in a loss
of such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege) or
(D) if it reasonably determines that such access is reasonably likely to
materially disrupt, impair or interfere with its, or its Subsidiaries',
business or operations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties will work in
good faith to determine a means to provide access that will not materially
disrupt, impair or interfere with such business or operations. Each of the
Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, each of the Company Parties and each of the Parent
Parties shall not, and shall direct their respective Representatives and
Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate (for the avoidance of
doubt, other than any public communications otherwise permitted by this
Agreement) with parties with which such Party knows the other Party has a
business relationship (including tenants/subtenants) regarding the business
of such other Party or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of such other Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement or in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, a Party and its
respective Representatives and Affiliates may contact or otherwise
communicate with such parties without any consent of the other Party (I) in
pursuing its own business activities (operating in the ordinary course) or
(II) in connection with the activities contemplated by _Section 7.18_.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

(b)  Prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall hold, and will cause its respective Representatives
and Affiliates to hold any nonpublic information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_ in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance
with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms
thereof notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
termination thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Section 9 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect.

  



  

Section 7.7   _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Change in Company Recommendation or any action taken by the Company or the
Company Board pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.4_, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, the Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as otherwise
permitted or required by this Agreement and except for the initial press
release that will be mutually agreed in good faith by the Parties, none of
the Company or the Parent shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement or filing prior to obtaining the consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without the prior consent of the
other Parties, issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or filing (a) if the disclosure contained therein is consistent in
all material respects with the initial press release referred to above or (b)
as may be required by Law, order or the applicable rules of any stock exchange
or quotation system if, in the case of this clause (b), (i) for any reason it
is not reasonably practicable to consult with the other Party before making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the Party issuing such
press release or making such public statement has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party and to obtain such Party's
consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner through no fault of
such issuing Party.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

Section 7.8   _Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and
Parent OP, as applicable, to, provide each individual who is an employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Topco Merger
Effective Time and who remains employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
Parent OP immediately following the Topco Merger Effective Time (each, a
"Continuing Employee" and collectively, the "Continuing Employees") with
compensation and benefits determined by the Parent Parties and, if
applicable, compensation and benefits that are mutually agreed between the
Parent Parties and such Continuing Employee. In addition, during the period
commencing on the Topco Merger Effective Time and ending on the date that
is twenty four (24) months after the Topco Merger Effective Time (or if
earlier, the date of the Continuing Employee's termination of employment with
Parent, Parent OP and the Parent Subsidiaries), Parent shall, and shall cause
each Parent Subsidiary and Parent OP, as applicable, to, provide Continuing
Employees with severance benefits that are consistent with, and no less
favorable than, those provided for in the severance plan in effect for such
Continuing Employee as of the Closing as described on _Section 4.14(g)_  of
the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b)  Parent shall, and shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and
Parent OP, as applicable, to, provide, each employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries whose employment terminates as of the Topco Merger
Effective Time, and who meets the requirements for severance pay under the
applicable severance plan in effect for such employee as of the Topco Merger
Effective Time as described in _Section 4.14(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
with severance benefits that are consistent with, and no less favorable
than, those provided for in such severance plan.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall, and shall cause Parent OP and the Parent
Subsidiaries to, provide credit for each Continuing Employee's length of
service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit level under any employee
vacation, severance or paid time off benefit plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement, or any retirement or savings plan, maintained by Parent,
Parent OP and the Parent Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate ("Parent Employee Program") (but not for purposes of
any benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) to the same extent
that such service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except
that no such prior service credit will be required or provided to the extent
that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits, or (ii) such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Program.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

(d)  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall
use, and shall cause the Parent OP and the Parent Subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Employee Program in which
any Continuing Employee participates that provides health or welfare benefits
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting
periods and service conditions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Continuing Employees, other than
limitations applicable under the corresponding Company Employee Program or to
the extent that such preexisting condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Company Employee Program and (ii) honor any
payments, charges and expenses of Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximums under the corresponding Company Employee Program in satisfying any
applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under a
corresponding Parent Employee Program during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs.

  



  

(e)  During the Interim Period, the Parent Parties and the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and agree to cause their
applicable Affiliates to, cooperate with each other to accomplish the matters
addressed by this _Section 7.8_ and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
agree, upon the reasonable request of Parent, to assist the Parent Parties
with respect to post-closing employment matters relating to employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f)  Nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall (i) confer any rights
upon any Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, other than the Parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or
create an employment agreement or create any right in any Continuing Employee
or any other Person to any continued employment or service with or for, or to
receive any compensation or benefits from, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent OP, the Parent Subsidiaries, (iii) constitute or
be treated as an amendment, modification, adoption, suspension or termination
of any Company Employee Program or any Parent Employee Program, or (iv) alter
or limit the ability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Parent
OP, or the Parent Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, consistent with the
terms of such plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement.

  



  

Section 7.9   _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (before and, as relevant, after the Topco Merger
Effective Time) to cause each of the Company Merger and the Topco Merger to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Provided the Company shall have received the opinion of counsel referred
to in _Section 8.3(e)_ and Parent shall have received the opinion of counsel
referred to in _Section 8.2(e)_, the Parties shall treat each of the Company
Merger and the Topco Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code and no Party shall take any position for Tax purposes inconsistent
therewith, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(b)  Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to
Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. The Parent Parties shall pay or cause to be paid,
without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Shares or Partnership OP Units, all Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall cooperate and consult in good faith with
Parent with respect to maintenance of the REIT status of the Company (and any
of the Company's Subsidiaries that is a REIT) for the Company's 2019 taxable
year. The Parent and the Company shall cooperate to cause each Taxable REIT
Subsidiary of the Company to jointly elect with Parent to be treated as a
Taxable REIT Subsidiary of Parent, effective as of the date of the Topco
Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  Parent OP shall adopt the "traditional method" as set forth

Section 7.10   _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction
Litigation_

  



  

(a)  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, any of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with any of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Promptly after becoming aware, the Company shall give
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give written notice to Company, if
(i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
becomes untrue or inaccurate such that, if uncured, it would be reasonably
expected to result in any of the applicable closing conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ not being capable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date;
or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement such that, if uncured, it would result in any of the
applicable closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be
satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification (or failure to
give such notification) shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, if, to the Company's Knowledge or the
Parent's Knowledge, as applicable, the occurrence of any state of facts or
Event would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be satisfied or
satisfaction to be reasonably delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the failure by the Company, Parent or their
respective Representatives to provide such prompt notice under _Section
7.10(a)_, _Section 7.10(b)_ or _Section 7.10(c_) shall not constitute a
breach of covenant for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

(c)  Each of the Company and Parent agrees to give prompt
written notice to the other Party upon becoming aware of the occurrence or

case may be.

  



  

(d)  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to the
Company's Knowledge or Parent's Knowledge, as applicable, threatened against,
relating to or involving such Party or any Company Subsidiary or Parent
Subsidiary, respectively, that relates to this Agreement, the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party shall keep
the other Party reasonably informed regarding any such matters. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any litigation against the Company, its trustees or its
officers relating to this Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parent's prior written consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect
to any such settlement that only requires payment of monetary amounts by the
Company, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any litigation against Parent,
its directors or its officers relating to this Agreement, the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required by
the Company Equity Incentive Plan no later than immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time to effect the intent of _Article III_ and to
terminate the Company Equity Incentive Plan effective as of the Topco Merger
Effective Time, and to ensure that no awards will be made under the Company

satisfactory to Parent. Regardless of whether the Company 401(k) Plan

reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other

Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

aside any dividend or other distribution to its respective stockholders
or shareholders without the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of
the Company and, following the Company Merger Effective Time, New Liberty
Holdco) or the Company (in the case of Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the written consent of the other Party shall not be required (but written
notice shall be given) for (i) in the case of the Company, (x)
the authorization and payment of quarterly distributions at a rate not in
excess of $0.41 per share, per quarter and (y) for the avoidance of doubt,
the regular distributions that are required to be made in respect of the
Partnership OP Units in connection with any dividends paid on the Company
Common Shares and Partnership Preferred Units in accordance with the terms of
the Partnership Agreement and (ii) in the case of Parent, (x) the
authorization and payment of quarterly distributions at a rate not in
excess of $0.53 per share, per quarter ( _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent and the Parent Board shall be
permitted to increase such quarterly dividend without the Company's consent by

and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the regular distributions that are

distributions that are required to be made in respect of the Parent Preferred
Units in accordance with the Parent Partnership Agreement; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that (A) it is agreed that the Parties shall take such actions as
are necessary to ensure that if either the holders of Company Common Shares
or the holders of Parent Common Stock receive a distribution for a particular
quarter prior to the Closing Date, then the holders of Company Common Shares
and the holders of Parent Common Stock, respectively, shall also receive a
distribution for such quarter, whether in full or pro-rated for the applicable
quarter, as necessary to result in the holders of Company Common Shares and
the holders of Parent Common Stock receiving dividends covering the same
periods prior to the Closing Date and (B) the Parties will cooperate such
that any such quarterly distribution by the Company and Parent shall have the
same record date and the same payment date in order to ensure that the
shareholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent receive the same
number of such dividends prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

  



  

   

91

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent, as applicable,
shall be permitted to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders or
stockholders, the record date for which shall be the close of business on the
last Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the payment date shall be as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, distributing any amounts
determined by such Party (in each case in consultation with the other
Party) to be the minimum dividend required to be distributed in order for
such Party to qualify as a REIT and to avoid to the extent
reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise Tax (any dividend paid
pursuant to this paragraph, a "REIT Dividend").

  



  

(c)  If either Party determines that it is necessary to declare
a REIT Dividend, it shall notify the other Party at least twenty (20) days
prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting and such other Party
shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of
the Company, to holders of Company Common Shares, in an amount per Company
Common Share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the REIT Dividend
declared by Parent with respect to each share of Parent Common Stock by (B)
the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case of Parent, to holders of Parent Common
Stock, in an amount per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the REIT Dividend declared by the Company with respect to each Company
Common Share and (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date for any dividend
payable pursuant to this _Section 7.17(c)_ shall be the close of business on
the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the payment date for such
dividend shall be as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.

purchases or sales referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) to be

necessary for such purchases or sales to constitute part of one or more like-
kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code, (d) convert or cause the
conversion of one or more wholly owned Company Subsidiaries that are
organized as corporations into limited liability companies (or, if any such
Company Subsidiary is organized as a limited liability company, make an
election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) to be disregarded
as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and
one or more Company Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships
into limited liability companies, on the basis of organizational documents as
reasonably requested by Parent, (e) sell or cause to be sold stock,
partnership interests, limited liability company interests or other equity
interests owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company in one or more Company
Subsidiaries at a price and on such other terms as designated by Parent, (f)
exercise any right of the Company or a Company Subsidiary to terminate or
cause to be terminated any contract to which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is a party and (g) sell or cause to be sold any of the assets and
properties of the Company or one or more Company Subsidiaries at a price and

described in clause (c) through (g), a "Parent-Approved Transaction");
_provided_ , that (i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action in contravention of (A) any
organizational document of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
existing as of the date hereof, (B) any Company Material Contract existing as
of the date hereof, or (C) applicable Law, (ii) any such conversions,
effective times of terminations, sales or transactions, including the
consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction or other obligations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to incur any liabilities with respect thereto,
shall be contingent upon all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ having been satisfied (or, with respect to _Section 8.2_, waived) and
receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent to such effect and
that the Parent Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing
(it being understood that in any event the transactions described in clauses
(a), (b), (c) and (d) will be deemed to have occurred prior to the
Closing), (iii) such actions (or the inability to complete such actions)
shall not affect or modify in any respect the obligations of the Parent
Parties under this Agreement, including the amount of or timing of payment of
the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration, the Partnership
Merger Common Consideration and the Partnership Merger Preferred
Consideration, (iv) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any such action that could adversely affect the

as a REIT, as a REIT or could subject the Company or any such Subsidiary to
any "prohibited transactions" Taxes or other material Taxes under Code
Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 (or other material entity-level Taxes) and
(v) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take
any such action that could result in any United States federal, state or
local income Tax being imposed on any holder of Partnership OP Units or
Partnership Preferred Units other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Such actions or transactions shall be undertaken in the manner (including in
the order) specified by Parent and, subject to the limits set forth above and
except as agreed by Parent and the Company, such actions or transactions
shall be implemented immediately prior to or concurrent with the
Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or be deemed to be breached or
violated by, the transactions or cooperation contemplated by this  _Section
7.18_. The Company shall not be deemed to have made a Change in Company
Recommendation or entered into or agreed to enter an Acquisition Agreement as
a result of providing any cooperation or taking any actions to the extent
requested by Parent in connection with a Parent-Approved Transaction. The
consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction shall not constitute
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section 9.3(a)_,
nor shall any Acquisition Proposal made in respect of a Parent-Approved
Transaction constitute an Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section
9.3(a)_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this _Section
7.18_, and Parent shall indemnify the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the extent arising therefrom (and in the
event the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not consummated, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries not previously reimbursed), other than any such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties that result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or from their failure to comply with any
instructions of Parent with respect to any such actions.

Section 7.19   _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. The Company and New
Liberty Holdco shall effectuate, or cause to be effectuated, the transactions
set forth in _Section 7.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company
hereby covenants and agrees to cause Company Merger Sub, once formed, not to
(a) engage in any business activities, (b) have any liabilities or
obligations, other than those incident to its formation and incurred pursuant
to this Agreement, and (c) conduct any operations except as contemplated
hereby.

  



  

Section 7.20   _Pending Closing_. Between the Company Merger Effective
Time and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries shall not take any action or conduct any business of
any nature whatsoever other than as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement and as necessary to effect the Topco Merger, the Contribution and
Issuance and the Partnership Merger.

  



  

Section 7.21   _Registration Rights Agreements_. Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the resale of the Parent Common Stock that
may be issued upon redemption of the New OP Units, including by any pledgees
of the New OP Units, to be included on its existing registration statement
promptly following the Closing (but, in any event, on or prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day after the Closing Date).

  



  

Section 7.22   _Financing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)  During the Interim Period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their
Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with financing arrangements (including assumptions,
guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications, refinancings,
replacements, repayments, terminations or prepayments of the Company
Debt Agreements) as Parent may reasonably determine necessary or advisable in
connection with the completion of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including timely taking all corporate action reasonably
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of any documents to be
entered into prior to Closing in respect of the Company Debt Agreements and
delivering all officer's certificates and legal opinions required to be
delivered in connection thereof; _provided_ that any
arrangements, guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications,
refinancings, replacements, repayments, terminations, prepayments or
other transactions or documents entered into pursuant to this _Section
7.22(a)_ shall be effective at or immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time (other than any notices required to be given in advance of such
time in order for any such financing arrangements or documents to be
effective at or immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time).

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(b)  During the Interim Period, Parent or one or more of its
Subsidiaries may (i) commence any of the following: (A) one or more offers to
purchase any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Company Notes
Indenture for cash (the "Offers to Purchase"); or (B) one or more offers to
exchange any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Company Notes
Indenture for securities issued by the Partnership or any of its
Affiliates (the "Offers to Exchange"); and (ii) solicit the consent of the
holders of debt issued under the Company Notes Indenture regarding certain
proposed amendments thereto (the  "Consent Solicitations" and, together
with the Offers to Purchase and Offers to Exchange, if any, the "Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations"); _provided_ that any such notice or offer shall
expressly reflect that, and it shall be the case that, the closing of any
such transaction shall not be consummated until the Closing. Any Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be made on such terms and conditions
(including price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by Parent and
which are permitted by the terms of the Company Notes Indenture and applicable
Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. Parent shall consult with the
Company regarding the material terms and conditions of any Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations, including the timing and commencement of any Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations and any tender deadlines. Parent shall
have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to
exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press
release, if any, in connection therewith, and each other document relevant to
the transaction that will be distributed by Parent in the applicable Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations (collectively, the "Debt Offer Documents") a
reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations to allow the Company and its counsel to review and
comment on such Debt Offer Documents, and Parent shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made or input provided by the Company
and its legal counsel. Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder
consents, in connection with any or all of the Consent Solicitations, the
Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Company Notes Indenture
in accordance with the terms thereof amending the terms and provisions of
thereof as described in the applicable Debt Offer Documents in a form as
reasonably requested by Parent (the "Supplemental Indenture"); _provided_
that the amendments effected by such supplemental indenture shall not become
operative until the Closing. During the Interim Period, at Parent's sole
expense, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
cause its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent in connection with any Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations (including using commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company's independent accountants to provide customary consents for
use of their reports to the extent required in connection with any
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations). The dealer manager, solicitation
agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected and retained
by Parent. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any
information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
such party that discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify the other Party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be
disseminated to the holders of the notes outstanding under the Company Notes
Indenture.

Section 7.23   _Withholding Certificates_. The Partnership shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time a duly executed certificate of non-foreign
status, dated as of the date of the Topco Merger Effective Time, from each
holder of Partnership OP Units that is a "United States person" (as such term
is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) in compliance with Treasury
Regulations 1.1445-2(b)(2), Section 1446(f)(2)(A) of the Code, IRS Notice
2018-29 and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.1446-2(b)(2); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that any such certificate of non-foreign status
is not delivered to Parent prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
Parent's remedy shall be limited to withholding pursuant to this Agreement.

_Section 7.4_;

  



  

(ii)  if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued an order, decree, judgment, injunction or taken any other

aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(b)_ and such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being
cured by the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after such notice is given or

warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ would not be
satisfied;

  



  

   

100

 



    



  

(d)  by the Company upon written notice from the Company to
Parent, if any of the Parent Parties breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section
8.2(b)_ would not be satisfied;

  



  

(e)  by the Company upon written notice from the Company to
Parent, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal in compliance with _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Agreement may not be so terminated unless the payment required by

occurrence of such termination and entry into such Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; or

  



  

(f)  by Parent upon written notice from Parent to the Company,

of Termination),  _Section 9.3_ (Termination Fees and Expense Amount),
_Section 9.4_ (Payment of Expense Amount or Termination Fee) and _Article

Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the
Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made.

  



  

   

101

 



    



  

Section 9.3   _Termination Fees and Expense Amount_.

  



  

(a)  If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, and, after the date hereof and prior to
the termination of this Agreement, the Company (i) receives or has received
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Company
Board prior to the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting (with respect to a
termination under _Section 9.1(b)(i)_) or prior to the date of termination of
this Agreement (with respect to a termination under _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 9.1(c)_), and (ii) before the date that is twelve (12) months after
the date of termination of this Agreement, any transaction or series of
related transactions included within the definition of an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated or the Company or a Company Subsidiary enters into an
Acquisition Agreement, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent, subject to the provisions of _Section 9.4(a)_, the Termination Fee
minus, if previously paid pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, the Expense Amount,
by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, not
later than the earlier of consummation of such transaction arising from such
Acquisition Proposal or the execution of such Acquisition Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 9.3(a)_, the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty (50%)."

  



  

(b)  If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_ or (ii) Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then, in
each case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, subject to
the provisions of _Section 9.4(a)_, the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days of such termination.

  



  

(c)  If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_, the Company shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Parent the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the date
of such termination.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Parties agree that:

  



  

(i)  under no circumstances shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion;

  



  

(ii)  under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay
the Expense Amount on more than one occasion; and

  



  

(iii)  if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which
the Company is required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ and the Termination Fee is paid to Parent (or its
designee), the payment of the Termination Fee will be the Parent Parties'
sole and exclusive remedy against the Company Parties arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or a Willful
Breach of this Agreement by any of the Company Parties.

  



  

   

102

 



    



  

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee
nor the Expense Amount is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
such amounts are due and payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.3_, such
that the Company shall pay Parent its costs and Expenses in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ on the
date of payment for the period from the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser
rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 9.4   _Payment of Expense Amount or Termination Fee_.

  



  

(a)  In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent
the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
from the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee deposited into escrow in
accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, and (ii) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent (or its designee) without
causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code ("Qualifying
Income"), as determined by Parent's independent certified public accountants
(taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent which is not
Qualifying Income and any appropriate "cushion" as determined by such
accountants), plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (1) a letter from
Parent's counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS
described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_ or (2) an opinion from Parent's outside
counsel as described in _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, an amount equal to the excess
of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, less the amount
payable under clause (A) above. To secure the Company's obligation to pay
these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal
to the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, with an
escrow agent selected by the Company (that is reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) and on such terms (subject to _Section 9.4(b)_) as shall be mutually
agreed in good faith upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee,
as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall be made, at the time
the Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant to _Section
9.3_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

   

103

 



    



  

(b)  The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount
or the Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof shall
not be released to Parent (or its designee) unless the escrow agent receives
any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parent's
independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent (or its designee) without causing
Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Parent's
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to Parent (or its designee), or (ii) a letter from Parent's
counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that
the receipt by Parent (or its designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, indicating that Parent's outside
counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent
(or its designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, to Parent (or its
designee). The Company agrees to amend this _Section 9.4(b)_ at the request
of Parent in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, as applicable, that may be distributed to Parent (or its
designee) hereunder without causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve
Parent's chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section
9.4(b)_ or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.4(b)_. The escrow agreement
shall also provide that any portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination
Fee, as applicable, that remains unpaid as of the end of the taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject
to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 9.4_;  _provided_ , that the
obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Expense Amount
and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, shall terminate on the December 31
following the date which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement
and any such unpaid portion shall be released by the escrow agent to the
Company. The Company shall not be a party to such escrow agreement and shall
not bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

  



  

(c)  Except at set forth in _Section 9.3_ and this _Section
9.4_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
fees and expenses whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

  



  

Section 9.5   _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties, at any time before or after the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made
which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining
such approval.

  



  

Section 9.6   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company Parties, on the one hand, and
the Parent Parties, on the other hand, may to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other Parties with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Parent Parties, on the other
hand, to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Parties against which such waiver
or extension is to be enforced. The failure of a Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.2   _Interpretation_. The table of contents and the headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever
used herein, a pronoun in the masculine gender shall be considered as
including the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall
be to an Article or a Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words  "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or"
when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. When a reference is made in this
Agreement, to the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, to information or documents being "provided,"  "made available" or
"disclosed" by a Party to another Party or its Affiliates, such information or

prior to the date of this Agreement, or (c) otherwise provided in writing
(including electronically) to the other Party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement. Any statute defined or referred to herein means such statute as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by succession
of comparable successor statutes. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and permitted assigns. Where this Agreement states that
a Party "shall," "will" or "must" perform in some manner, it means that the
Party is legally obligated to do so under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.3   _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None
of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Partnership Merger Effective Time. This _Section 10.3_ shall not
limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

  



  

Section 10.4   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes,
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement and supersedes all
of the prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the Parties, or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 10.5   _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as
expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Except for
(a) _Article II_ and _Article III_, which shall inure to the benefit of
the shareholders of the Company and the limited partners of the Partnership
who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who
may enforce the covenants contained therein, and (b) _Section 7.5_, which
shall inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting therefrom who are
expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce
the covenants contained therein, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer on any person other than the Parties or their
respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.6   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.7   _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a)  The Partnership Merger shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its
rules of conflict of laws. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Maryland without regard to
its rules of conflict of laws.

  



  

(b)  Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consent to and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Maryland), Business and Technology Case Management Program
(the "Maryland Court") for any litigation arising out of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agree not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such court), waive any objection to the
laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Court and agree not to
plead or claim in the Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the
assignment of any such proceeding to the Maryland Court's Business and
Technology Case Management Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
affect the rights of any Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or order
of the Maryland Court as provided by Law. Each of the Parties agrees, (i) to
the extent such Party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the
State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland
as such Party's agent for acceptance of legal process, and (ii) that service
of process may also be made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (i) or (ii)
above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party
personally within the State of Maryland.

Section 10.8   _Remedies_.

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

(b)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set
forth in this _Section 10.8_, it is agreed that prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ the non-breaching Party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by any other Party and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  The Parties' right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby and each
Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by any
other Party (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity), and each Party shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 10.8(c)_. In the event any Party seeks an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.8(c)_.

  



  

Section 10.9   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Party (including by means of
electronic delivery). Facsimile and electronic .pdf transmission of any signed
original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an original.

  



  

Section 10.10   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

  



  

   

108

 



    



  

Section 10.11   _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
