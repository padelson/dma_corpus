the Topco Merger Effective Time represented outstanding New Liberty Holdco Common Shares whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)(i)</U>: (i) a letter of transmittal (a
 &ldquo;<B>Letter of Transmittal</B>&rdquo;) which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), to the
Exchange Agent, which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree upon, and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of New Liberty Holdco
Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.8</U> and dividends

required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the New Liberty Holdco Common Shares
previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;III</U>, plus any Fractional
Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;3.8</U> and any
amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.4(e)</U> to be mailed or delivered by wire transfer, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the later to occur of (A) the Topco Merger Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agent&rsquo;s receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and such Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company or a transfer of ownership of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of New Liberty Holdco, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;3.4</U>,
each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Topco Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive,
upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this <U>Article&nbsp;III</U>. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof).</P>

has occurred since December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2017, (x) Parent has designed and maintains disclosure controls and

be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Parent&rsquo;s management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (i)&nbsp;to Parent&rsquo;s Knowledge, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent to material
information required to be included in the reports Parent is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (ii)&nbsp;Parent&rsquo;s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent&rsquo;s independent registered public
accounting firm and the audit committee of Parent Board (A) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of Parent&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Parent&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B)&nbsp;any known
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent&rsquo;s internal
controls over financial reporting. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the statements contained in all such
certifications were, as of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.</P>

the Topco Merger (and, if required, with respect to the New Liberty Holdco Common Shares issuable in the Company Merger), which

Statement/Prospectus comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities Act, and
(C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Mergers. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have the application for the listing of the Parent Common Stock accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable
following submission. Each of the Parties hereto shall furnish to any other Party any and all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates and the holders of its shares of beneficial interest or capital stock as may be required or reasonably requested to
be disclosed in the Form S-4 and in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and provide

promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the NYSE and of any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements

all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or with respect to the
NYSE listing application received from the NYSE and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE listing application. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and to any comments from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE listing application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (1) filing the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC, or (2) submitting the NYSE listing application to the NYSE or responding to
any comments of the NYSE, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response) and shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other Party or its counsel. Parent shall advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, (x) of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Topco Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated and (y) of the time the NYSE listing application is accepted.
Parent shall take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, NYSE rules and regulations,
any applicable foreign or state securities or &ldquo;blue sky&rdquo; Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection
with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Topco Merger, and the Company shall furnish to Parent all information concerning
the Company and the Company&rsquo;s shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions. Parent shall
also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or &ldquo;blue
sky&rdquo; Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the New OP Units and New Preferred
OP Units in the Partnership Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company, the Partnership and
the holders of the Partnership OP Units and Partnership Preferred Units as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such actions. The Parent Parties shall have the right, to the extent necessary (and following consultation with the Company),
to prepare and file a Form S-4 or any other registration form under the Securities Act or Exchange Act with respect to the New
OP Units and New Preferred OP Units (the &ldquo;<B>OP Unit Form S-4</B>&rdquo;) to be issued in connection with the Partnership
Merger. The Company Parties will cooperate in the preparation of the OP Unit Form S-4 pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Parent Parties determine to prepare and file the OP Unit Form S-4, (I) the Parent
Parties shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after such determination, the
OP Unit Form S-4, and (II) all references in this Agreement to &ldquo;Form S-4&rdquo; (including this <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U>
