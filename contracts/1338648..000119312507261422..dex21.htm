1  ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, with
the Company continuing to exist under the laws of the State of Delaware as the
corporation surviving such merger (the Company, as such surviving corporation,
the "Surviving Corporation").

 Section 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1 hereof, the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of
those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in Article VIII hereof, unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company (the
date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New
York 10019, unless another place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company.

 Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, the Company shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger,
substantially in the form attached as  _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with and accepted by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as

Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger shall become effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL (including, without limitation,

and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,

the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of
the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit A attached to the
Certificate of Merger, and the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as
so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter shall continue to be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until changed or amended as
provided therein and under applicable law.

 Section 1.6. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without any further action
on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and thereafter shall continue to be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until changed or amended or repealed as provided
therein, in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
under applicable law.

 Section 1.7. _Directors; Officers_.

(a) _Members of Board of Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the
members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist
of the Company Designated Directors and the Parent Designated Directors, each
to serve until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal.



 

2 (b) _Officers of Parent and Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to serve until their respective successor
is elected and qualified or until their respective earlier death, resignation
or termination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, at the Effective Time, Sean
C. McDonald shall become the Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving
Corporation until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation or termination.

 Section 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. After the Conversion and at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Etc_. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, or otherwise owned by
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no payment shall be made or consideration delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
shares of Company Common Stock referred to in Section 1.8(b) hereof and shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") and the
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the following,
subject to Section 2.4 hereof with respect to fractional shares, and to
Section 2.10 hereof with respect to shares deposited with the Escrow Agent:

(i) the Per Share Merger Consideration;

(ii) the Milestone Consideration Per Share (if any); and

(iii) the Top-Up Consideration Per Share (if any).

(d) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of capital stock of the Company that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
a holder thereof who has validly demanded payment of the fair value for such
shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead shall
be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL, unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holderÂ’s right under the DGCL. If any such holder of
shares of capital stock of the Company shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of Company Common
Stock held by such holder shall be treated, at ParentÂ’s sole discretion, as a
share of Company Common Stock that had been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 1.8(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of any demands (and any withdrawals thereof) received by the Company for
appraisal of shares the CompanyÂ’s capital stock pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to reasonably participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or waive any rights with respect to, any such demands.

  

 

3  Section 1.9. _Equitable Adjustment of Shares_. If prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, or
pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock, as applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock into any other securities, or make any other
stock dividend or distribution in capital stock (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock) of Parent or the Company in respect of
the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively, then the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
split, combination, reclassification, dividend or other distribution or
change.

 Section 1.10. _Treatment of Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase a share of
Company Common Stock (collectively, " _Company Options_ ") granted under any
Company Stock Plan, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall
automatically be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, into an option to acquire such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Rollover Option_ ") equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional share
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Each Rollover Option shall also include the right to receive
the applicable Milestone Consideration Per Share (if any) and the applicable
Top-Up Consideration Per Share (if any). Each Rollover Option shall be subject
to, and shall vest and remain exercisable in accordance with, the same terms
and conditions of the Company Option it replaces, except that the exercise
price per share of each Rollover Option shall be equal to the quotient of (i)
the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio (provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). The conversion of the Company Options to Rollover Options
pursuant to this Section 1.10 shall be effected in a manner consistent with
Section 424 of the Code. Parent shall take reasonable steps to ensure that
any Company Option that qualifies as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code immediately prior to the Closing shall not lose its status as
an incentive stock option as a result of the conversion to a Rollover Option
described above. Following the Closing, Parent shall send to each holder of a
Rollover Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such Rollover Option, and (ii) the exercise
price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rollover
Option. Not later than four (4) business days (within the meaning of Form 8-K)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, with full cooperation from the
Company prior to the Closing and from the Surviving Corporation following the
Closing, prepare and file with the SEC a report on Form 8-K as required with
respect to the Merger. As soon as permissible following the filing of such
report on Form 8-K, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 registering the exercise of any Rollover Options. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause, to the extent reasonably
practicable, any shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon exercise of
Rollover Options prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement on
Form S-8 to be included in the shares to be registered in the Registration
Statement, and (ii) to cause such Form S-8 registration statement to remain
effective for so long as any Rollover Options remain outstanding.

(b) All shares of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plans (and any other shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting
or future issuance under the Company Stock Plans) (collectively, " _Other
Stock Awards_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested, shall be treated in the same manner as all other shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Per Share Merger Consideration, Milestone
Consideration Per Share (if any) and the Top-Up Consideration Per Share (if
any) received by each holder in exchange for the holderÂ’s Other Stock Awards
shall be subject to the terms and conditions (including vesting schedules)
applicable to such Other Stock Awards as in effect prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) The Company and Parent shall take all such steps and actions as may be
required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.10 and any
other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative
securities) in  



 

4  connection with this Agreement by each individual who (i) is a director or

 ARTICLE II.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; ESCROW OF SHARES

 Section 2.1. _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will send, or cause to be sent, to each record holder
of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) or shares of Company Preferred Stock that have
been converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to the Conversion: (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
to Parent of the Certificates, and shall be in customary form); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of
a Certificate, upon surrender of the Certificate to, or as instructed by,
Parent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent, shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the
number of full shares of Parent Common Stock, and the amount of cash, if any,
in respect of fractional shares and any dividends or other  



 

7  distributions to which holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof,
into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement. Parent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as Parent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
or pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. In the event that any Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, as the result of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock which
was not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more
certificates evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount in lieu of fractional shares
and with respect to any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, may be issued with respect to
such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (on an as converted basis
pursuant to the Conversion) to the person so named only if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
is presented to, or as instructed by, Parent, properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer to the Person
so named, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.

 Section 2.2. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 Section 2.3. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash, if any, paid in lieu of
fractional shares or pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof paid upon conversion of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I
hereof and this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
(including any and all shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Conversion).

 Section 2.4. _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates
or scrip representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof. Each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock and (ii)
the Parent Common Stock Price.

 Section 2.5. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Per
Share Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 Section 2.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, and the delivery to Parent of such other documentation (including
an indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, Parent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 



 

8  Section 2.7. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

 Section 2.8. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 Section 2.9. _Stock Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of capital stock or other securities of
the Company on the records of the Company. Any Certificate presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent after the Effective Time for transfer shall be
cancelled and extinguished and exchanged for the Per Share Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Article I
hereof, together with any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

 Section 2.10. _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, the Per Share Escrow
Consideration shall be deducted from the Per Share Merger Consideration
issuable to the Former Company Stockholders pursuant to Article I (the
"Escrowed Shares") and shall be deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent to
be held in escrow for the purpose of satisfying any claims for indemnification
made by the Parent Indemnitees under Article X hereof. The Escrowed Shares
shall be administered in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 Section 2.11. _Treatment of Contingent Consideration; Issuance of Separate
Share Certificates_. Any Parent Common Stock issued as Top-Up Consideration or
as Milestone Consideration hereunder shall be treated as comprised of two
components, respectively a principal component and an interest component, the
amounts of which shall be determined as provided in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.483-4(b), Example (2), using the three-month test rate of interest
provided for in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) employing the
semi-annual compounding period. As to such Parent Common Stock, shares
representing the principal component (with a valueÂ—determined on the date of
issuanceÂ—equal to the principal component) and shares representing the
interest component (with a valueÂ—determined on the date of issuanceÂ—equal to
the interest component) shall be represented by separate share certificates.

such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation of

business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each party may restrict the foregoing access to
the extent that, in its reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if such party shall have
used all reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
access, or (ii) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to such party requires such party to preclude the other party and

consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties,
including Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
provide any notices to third parties required to be provided prior to the

delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it

54  Section 10.4. _Procedures for Third Party Claim Indemnification_.

(a) If the Former Company Stockholders have become obligated to a Parent
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, or if any suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding is begun, made or instituted by a third
party as a result of which the Former Company Stockholders may become
obligated to a Parent Indemnitee hereunder, such Parent Indemnitee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Former Company Stockholders); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure
of the Parent Indemnitee to give prompt written notice to the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Former Company Stockholders) shall not
relieve such Former Company Stockholders of their indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such Former Company Stockholders shall have
been materially prejudiced by such failure. The Former Company Stockholders
(through the Stockholder Representative) agree to defend, contest or
otherwise protect the Parent Indemnitee against any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding at the sole cost and expense of the Former
Company Stockholders. The Parent Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by
counsel of the Parent IndemniteeÂ’s choice and shall in any event cooperate
with and assist the Former Company Stockholders to the extent reasonably
possible. The Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Former Company
Stockholders) shall not compromise or settle any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding unless (x) such compromise or settlement is
on exclusively monetary terms and shall be paid entirely by the Former
Company Stockholders and the Parent Indemnitee receives an unconditional
release in such compromise or settlement or (y) the Parent Indemnitee shall
have consented in writing to the terms of such compromise or settlement, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Stockholder Representative
(on behalf of the Former Company Stockholders) fails timely to defend, contest
or otherwise protect against such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding, the Parent Indemnitee shall have the right to do so, including,
without limitation, the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof,
and the Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof
from the Former Company Stockholders (subject to Sections 10.2(b)(i) and (ii)
hereof), including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees,
disbursements and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding.

(b) If Parent has become obligated to the Former Company Stockholders pursuant
to Section 10.3 hereof, or if any suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding is begun, made or instituted by a third party as a result of which
Parent may become obligated to a Former Company Stockholder hereunder, the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Former Company Stockholders)
shall give prompt written notice thereof to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure of the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Former
Company Stockholders) to give prompt written notice to Parent shall not
relieve Parent of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the
extent Parent shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. Parent
agrees to defend, contest or otherwise protect the Former Company Stockholders
against any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding at its sole
cost and expense. The Former Company Stockholders (through the Stockholder
Representative) shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
at their own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the Stockholder
RepresentativeÂ’s choice and shall in any event cooperate with and assist
Parent to the extent reasonably possible. Parent shall not compromise or
settle any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding unless (x)
such compromise or settlement is on exclusively monetary terms and shall be
paid entirely by Parent and the Former Company Stockholders receive an
unconditional release in such compromise or settlement or (y) the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Former Company Stockholders)
shall have consented in writing to the terms of such compromise or settlement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Parent fails timely to
defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding, the Former Company Stockholders shall have
the right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to make any
compromise or settlement thereof, and the Former Company Stockholders shall
be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from Parent (subject to
Sections 10.3(b)(i) and (ii) hereof), including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees of one counsel to the Former Company
Stockholders, disbursements and amounts paid as the result of such suit,
action, investigation, claim or proceeding.



 

55  Section 10.5. _Payments_.

(a) All amounts payable with respect to Losses pursuant to this Article X
shall be settled:

(i) in the case of any claim by Parent, (A) with respect to Section
10.2(a)(ii) (other than with respect to any breach of the representations
contained in Section 3.5, Section 3.6(a), clause (i) and the last two
sentences of Section 3.6(b), Section 3.26, Section 3.29 or Section 3.30) and
Section 10.2(a)(iii) with respect thereto (other than in the case of a willful
breach of any obligation under this Article X), solely by collection of
Escrowed Shares from the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, until
all such Escrowed Shares have been so collected (or are subject to such
collection), or are otherwise released, from escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, and (B) with respect to (x) Section 10.2(a)(i) hereof, (y) Section
10.2(a)(ii) hereof as to any breach of the representations contained in
Section 3.5, Section 3.6(a), clause (i) and the last two sentences of Section
3.6(b), Section 3.26, Section 3.29 or Section 3.30 or (z) Section
10.2(a)(iii) hereof (except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately
preceding clause (A)), first, by collection of Escrowed Shares from the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, until such Escrowed Shares have been
so collected (or are subject to such collection) or are otherwise released,
from escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and second, by payment in cash
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; and 

(ii) in the case of any claim by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Former Company Stockholders), by payment in cash by check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

(b) The value of each Escrowed Share for purposes of making payments
to Parent on account of Losses in accordance with the provisions of this
Article X shall be deemed to be the Parent Common Stock Price. In case of a
payment owed by the Former Company Stockholders to Parent pursuant to this
Article X in respect of which Parent collects Escrowed Shares pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, upon such collection, each Former Company Stockholder shall
be deemed to have delivered and surrendered to Parent its Pro Rata Share of
the Escrowed Shares so collected by Parent.

(c) Except in the case of fraud or willful misrepresentation, the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties for monetary damages with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

56  on behalf of them by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the

agents or employees, if any, shall be liable to any person for any error of

Arbitration Association then in effect (the " _AAA Rules_ "). If the
Stockholder Representative or Parent shall elect to submit such dispute to
binding arbitration, it shall give notice thereof to the other party (an "
_Arbitration Notice_ "). Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single
arbitrator mutually selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if Parent and the Stockholder Representative

selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative. If Parent or the
Stockholder Representative fails to select an arbitrator within 10 days
following the delivery of the Arbitration Notice, then the other shall be
entitled to select the second arbitrator. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall use their respective reasonable efforts (i) to cause the
arbitration hearing with respect to such arbitration to be conducted within 75
days after the appointment of the mutually-selected arbitrator or the last of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, and (ii) to cause the decision of
the arbitrator(s) to be furnished within 95 days after the appointment of the
mutually-selected arbitrator or the last of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be. The parties further agree that discovery shall be completed at

the arbitrator(s) shall relate solely: (A) to whether the Parent Indemnitees
are (or any of them is) entitled to recover the  



 

4  Disputed Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of such Disputed
Amount the Parent Indemnitees are (or any of them is) entitled to recover;
and (B) to the determination of the identity of the non-prevailing party of
such arbitration, it being understood that, for purposes of this Section 7(d),
the identity of the non-prevailing party shall be determined solely by
the arbitrator(s). The final decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be furnished
to the Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing and
shall constitute a conclusive determination and resolution of the dispute in
question, shall be binding upon the Stockholder Representative, the Former
Company Stockholders, Parent, the Parent Indemnitees and the Escrow Agent and
shall not be contested by any of them. The non-prevailing party in any
arbitration under this Section 7(d) shall pay the reasonable and documented
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) of the prevailing party, any additional
reasonable and documented fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees) of the Escrow Agent, and the fees and expenses associated with the

expenses). Any such fees and expenses payable by the Former Company
Stockholders may, at the direction of the Stockholder Representative, be paid
out of Escrowed Shares. The Escrow Agent shall release Escrowed Shares from
the Escrow Account in connection with any Disputed Amount in accordance with
the instructions contained any Final Decision relating to such Disputed Amount
within five business days after the delivery to it of such Final Decision.

released from escrow to any Party by the Escrow Agent under this Section 7
shall be delivered to such Party in accordance with the written instructions
of such Party.

8\. _Term._ This Agreement shall terminate when all Escrowed Shares shall have
been released from escrow in accordance with the terms hereof. 

9\. _Fee; Reimbursement of Expenses._ In consideration for its services
hereunder, during the term hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be paid a fee and
shall be reimbursed for its expenses as set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto. Such fee and expense reimbursement shall be borne solely by Parent.

10\. _Replacement of Escrow Agent._

(a) The Escrow Agent may resign its duties and obligations hereunder by
giving to the Stockholder Representative and Parent written notice to that
effect, but its resignation shall not become effective until a successor
escrow agent shall have been appointed by mutual written agreement of
the Stockholder Representative and Parent. In the event the Escrow Agent
resigns in accordance with this Section 10(a), the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to retain all fees theretofore paid to it pursuant to this Agreement.
In the event the Escrow Agent is dissolved, becomes bankrupt or is otherwise
incapable of performing its duties and obligations hereunder, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall, within 10 business days of the occurrence of
the event which renders the Escrow Agent incapable of performing hereunder,
by mutual consent, appoint a successor escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall,
upon receipt of joint written instructions from the Stockholder Representative
and Parent, deliver all then remaining Escrowed Shares held hereunder to any
such successor escrow agent. In the event the Stockholder Representative and
Parent are unable to agree upon a successor escrow agent within 10 business
days after receipt of the Escrow AgentÂ’s written resignation or within 10
business days after the occurrence of the event which renders the Escrow Agent
incapable of performing hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall select a bank,
financial institution, trust company or financial services company
reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative and Parent as
successor escrow agent and deliver all then remaining Escrowed Shares held
hereunder to such successor escrow agent. Upon the appointment of a successor
escrow agent in accordance with the terms hereof, such successor escrow agent
shall thereafter be deemed to be the "Escrow Agent" for all purposes under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not have any duty to act, nor any liability
for failing to act, after giving notice of resignation, except only that the
Escrow Agent shall comply with its obligations to deliver the Escrowed Shares
held hereunder to a successor escrow agent as described herein. 



 

5 (b) The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall have the power at any time
by mutual written consent to remove the Escrow Agent (with or without cause)
by written notice. Such removal shall take effect upon delivery of the
Escrowed Shares held hereunder to a successor escrow agent designated in joint
written instructions signed by the Stockholder Representative and Parent. The
Escrow Agent shall deliver all of the Escrowed Shares held hereunder to the
successor escrow agent without unreasonable delay after receiving the
designation of such successor escrow agent.

 

11\. _Concerning the Escrow Agent_. Neither the Escrow Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement, except for its or their failure to comply with joint written
instructions as provided for herein, its or their own gross negligence,
willful misconduct or knowing violation of the terms of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent: (a) makes
no representation or warranty with respect to this Agreement, except that the
Escrow Agent represents and warrants that it has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement and that this Agreement is a valid, legal and binding
obligation of the Escrow Agent enforceable against it in accordance with the
terms hereof; (b) may consult with legal counsel selected by it and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the prior written advice of such counsel; and (c) shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing reasonably believed by it
to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper Party or Parties.

12\. _Stockholder Representative_. As provided in the Merger Agreement, by
virtue of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Former Company
Stockholders shall be deemed to have approved the indemnification and escrow
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and this Agreement and the appointment
of Joel P. Adams (or his successor or replacement) as the Stockholder
Representative, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or other property from the
Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect
to, claims of Parent Indemnitees hereunder, to take such other actions and to
possess such other power and authority as is set forth in Section 10.6 of the
Merger Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
reasonable judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment
of the foregoing. The Stockholder Representative may be replaced in accordance
with Section 10.6(d) of the Merger Agreement. Parent and the Escrow Agent
shall be notified promptly in writing of such appointment. Unless and until
Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of the
appointment of a successor Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected relying on,
the power and authority of the Stockholder Representative to act on behalf of
the Former Company Stockholders. The provisions of this Section 12 are
intended to supplement and be in furtherance of, and shall not, and shall not
be deemed or construed to, have the effect of limiting in any respect the
provisions of Section 10.6 of the Merger Agreement.

13.  _Indemnification of Escrow Agent_. The Stockholder Representative and
Parent each agree to severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Escrow Agent against and in respect of (a) any claim made against the
Escrow Agent because of its acting or failing to act in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) any loss the Escrow Agent may
sustain in carrying out the terms of this Agreement, including the reasonable
and documented fees and expenses of counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any
claim or loss resulting from or arising out of its failure to comply with
joint written instructions as provided for herein, its gross negligence,

1\. Definitions. In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this
Agreement, for purposes of this Exhibit H, the terms below shall have the
following meanings:

" _Acceleration Event_ " means the consummation of a sale, license, transfer
or other disposition of all or substantially all of ParentÂ’s or the Surviving

" _Milestone Consideration_ " means the payment due upon the earlier to be
achieved of Milestone One or Milestone Two. 

" _Milestone One Share Amount_ " means 4,250,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock.

" _Milestone Two Share Amount_ " means 3,187,500 shares of Parent Common
Stock.

" _Trailing 12-Month Revenue_ " means the aggregate net revenue recognized by
the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with GAAP on a
basis consistent with past practices during any 12 month period, excluding any

historically, and in no event lesser efforts or resources than normally used
by a company of a size comparable to the Surviving Corporation with respect to

similar stage of development.

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "gynecologic cancer" does not include
breast cancer. 

2\. Milestones

2.1 _Milestone One._ Upon the achievement by the Company and/or the Surviving
Corporation on or prior to June 30, 2010 of either (i) Trailing 12-Month
Revenue resulting from sales of services or products for use in connection
with non-gynecologic cancers in excess of $7,000,000, (ii) Trailing 12-Month
Revenue resulting from sales of services or products for any use in excess of
$40,000,000 or (iii) cumulative aggregate net revenue from sales of services
or products for use in connection with non-gynecologic cancers in excess of
$10,000,000 recognized by the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with past practices (each of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), a " _Milestone_ "), Milestone Consideration in
the amount of the Milestone One Share Amount shall be payable as provided in
Sections 1.8(c)(ii) and 1.10 of this Agreement and shall be treated and issued
as provided in Section 2.11 of this Agreement.

2.2 _Milestone Two._ Upon the achievement by the Company and/or the Surviving
Corporation after June 30, 2010, but on or prior to December 31, 2010, of a
Milestone, Milestone Consideration in the amount of the Milestone Two Share

Agreement and shall be treated and issued as provided in Section 2.11 of this
Agreement.

above shall be paid within 10 Business Days after the determination of the
achievement of the earlier to be achieved of a Milestone described in Section
2.1 or 2.2 above (as the case may be), which determination shall be made in
good faith by the Board of Directors of Parent within 45 days after the end of
each calendar quarter following the Closing Date. Prior to such payment, if
Parent should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Stock,
or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock, or
otherwise change the Parent Common Stock into any other securities, or
make any other stock dividend or distribution in capital stock (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock) of Parent in respect of
the  



 

1  Parent Common Stock, then the applicable Milestone Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such split, combination, reclassification,
dividend or other distribution or change.

3\. Diligence and Acceleration Events

3.1 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts and Reporting._ Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to

of products and services applicable to the achievement of any Milestone within
45 days after the end of each calendar quarter following the Closing Date and

Corporation, with respect to the status of the achievement of a Milestone
pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2.

3.2 _Acceleration Events._ Parent shall pay the entire Milestone One Share
Amount in the event that an Acceleration Event occurs on or before June 30,
2010, and shall pay the entire Milestone Two Share Amount if an Acceleration
Event occurs after June 30, 2010 but on or before December 31, 2010.

4\. Termination of Milestone Payment Obligations

4.1 _Termination._ Notwithstanding anything in this Exhibit H to the contrary,
in no event shall both the Milestone One Share Amount and the Milestone Two
Share Amount be paid or payable hereunder or otherwise by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, and upon payment of the Milestone One Share Amount or the
Milestone Two Share Amount as provided above, or in the event that no
Milestone is achieved on or before December 31, 2010, any and all obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Exhibit H shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect.
