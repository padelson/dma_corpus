AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (" _Agreement_ ") is
made and entered into as of December 13, 2007, by and among: ON SEMICONDUCTOR
CORPORATION, Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); ORANGE ACQUISITION
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "); and AMIS HOLDINGS, INC. , a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
_E XHIBIT A_ and other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined
in the Sections of this Agreement where they first appear.

RECITALS 

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL (the
" _Merger_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

B. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporations and stockholders that Merger Sub and the Company
consummate the Merger provided for herein.

C. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the Merger
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and intend
for this Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.

D. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition to and
inducement of Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
directors, executive officers and stockholders of the Company set forth on
_Schedule A_ are entering into voting undertakings in substantially the form
attached as _E XHIBIT B_ (the " _Company Voting Undertakings_ ").

E. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition to and
inducement of the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
directors and executive officers of Parent set forth on _Schedule B_ are
entering into voting undertakings in substantially the form attached as _E
XHIBIT C_ (the " _Parent Voting Undertakings_ ," and, with the Company Voting
Undertakings, the " _Voting Undertakings_ ").

F. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement and approved the Merger.

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

SECTION 1: DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION.

1.1 _Merger of Merger Sub into the Company_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. Following the Effective Time,
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").



 

1 EXECUTION COPY



 

1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of DLA Piper US LLP, 2415 East Camelback Road, Suite 700, Phoenix,
Arizona 85016, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent (the "
_Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the third business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be duly executed by the Company and,
simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of
State_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the later of: (a) the date
and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State, or (b) such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate
of Merger with the consent of Parent. The date and time the Merger becomes
effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time:

1.4(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended to
read in its entirety as set forth in  _E XHIBIT D_;

1.4(b) the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to
the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and

1.4(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors
and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.5 _Conversion of Shares_.

1.5(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
Sections 1.5(b) and 1.5(c), each share of Company Common Stock then
outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive 1.15 shares of Parent
Common Stock; and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.



 

2 EXECUTION COPY



 

The number of shares of Parent Common Stock specified in Section 1.5(a)(iii)
(as such number may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(b)) is
referred to as the " _Exchange Ratio_."

1.5(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted.

1.5(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender
of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market on the date the
Merger becomes effective.

1.6 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a)
all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1.5; and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Exchange Agent
(as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided
in Section 1.7.

1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

1.7(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank
or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "). Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) at or prior to the
Effective Time, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii) at, prior to or promptly
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than two (2) business days
thereafter, cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5(c). The shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent
with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange
Fund_."

1.7(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates
and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (" _Uncertificated Shares_
") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer of such
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of such  



 

3 EXECUTION COPY



 

 Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate or evidence of shares in book entry
form representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2)
the Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each
Company Stock Certificate and Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock) as contemplated by this Section 1\. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. 

1.7(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7
(at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property laws, escheat laws or similar laws, to receive
all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

1.7(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Common Stock as of the date 180 days after the date on which the
Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Company Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

1.7(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the proper
Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

1.7(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law
or similar Legal Requirement.

1.8 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

1.8(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted (or previously assumed) by
the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company
Option_ "), which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each an " _Outstanding Company Option_ ") shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be  



 

4 EXECUTION COPY



 

 assumed by Parent and converted automatically, into an option to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") in an amount and at
an exercise price determined as provided below (and each Converted Option
otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Companys 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan, or other governing share-based plan document, including plan
documents governing options that have previously been assumed by the Company
as a result of corporate acquisition transactions by the Company, as
applicable (collectively, and in each case as the same may be amended to
the date hereof, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") and the applicable agreement,
notice or letter evidencing the grant of the Company Option thereunder and any
Benefit Plan providing for accelerated vesting).

(i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to the Converted
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Outstanding Company Option and (y) the Exchange
Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share;
and

(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the Converted
Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
under the Outstanding Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, _provided_
that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

In the case of any Outstanding Company Option which is, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code), the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant
to the corresponding Converted Option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such Converted Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code and to avoid a "modification" of any such option under
Code Section 424(h). In all events, Outstanding Company Options shall be
converted into Converted Options in such a manner as to be compliant with
Section 409A of the Code (or an available exemption therefrom) and any
guidance issued thereupon by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Except as
otherwise provided in this section, the duration and other terms of each
Converted Option shall be the same as those of the applicable Outstanding
Company Option, except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to
be references to Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary to be taken by the Company in order to effect
the foregoing provisions of this section.

1.8(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted (or
previously assumed) by the Company representing a right to receive upon a
future date or dates shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company RSU
Award_ ") which is outstanding and which has not been settled by the issuance
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each an " _Outstanding Company RSU Award_ ") shall cease to represent a right
to receive upon settlement thereof shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a right to receive upon
settlement thereof shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted RSU Award_ ")
in an amount determined as provided below (and each Converted RSU Award
otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, and the applicable agreement, notice or letter evidencing the grant of
the Company RSU Award thereunder and any Benefit Plan providing for
accelerated vesting). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
subject to the Converted RSU Award shall be equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Outstanding Company
RSU Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole share. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all action necessary to be taken by the Company in order to effect the
foregoing provisions of this Section.



 

5 EXECUTION COPY



 

1.8(c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the
Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company
Option or a Company RSU Award nor any holder of any other equity-based right
shall have any right to acquire equity securities of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.8(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Converted Option or a Company RSU Award an
appropriate notice evidencing the foregoing assumption of the option or
restricted stock unit award by Parent. Parent shall comply with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans, as applicable, and the agreements, notices or
letters, subject to the adjustments pursuant to this Section. Each holder of
a Converted Option or a Company RSU Award shall be credited with such holders
service with Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such
holders vesting under such Converted Option or a Company RSU Award, as
applicable.

1.8(e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon the exercise of the Converted Options and settlement of the
Converted RSU Awards, including the authorization for listing of such shares
on The NASDAQ Stock Market. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
but not more than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to the Converted Options and Converted RSU Awards and shall use its best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements for so long as the Converted Options and
Converted RSU Awards remain outstanding.

1.8(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) that are necessary to (i) cause the
ending date of the then current purchase period under the ESPP to occur on or
before the last trading day prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final
Purchase Date_ "), (ii) cause all then existing offerings under the ESPP to
terminate immediately following the purchase on the Final Purchase Date, (iii)
suspend all future offerings that would otherwise commence under the ESPP
following the Final Purchase Date and (iv) cease all further payroll
deductions under the ESPP effective as of the Final Purchase Date. On the
Final Purchase Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such
date under the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to
the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP, which shares shall be treated in the manner described in
Section 1.5.

1.8(g) Employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall be permitted to participate in Parents employee stock purchase plan
commencing on the first enrollment date of such plan following the Effective
Time, subject to the eligibility provisions of such plan (with employees
receiving credit, for purposes of such eligibility provisions, for service
with Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries).

1.8(h) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase

or organization, with full corporate power or other entity authority to
conduct their respective businesses as now being conducted, to own or use the
respective properties and assets that they purport to own or use, and to
perform all their respective obligations under Acquired Corporation
Contracts. Each of the Acquired Corporations is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation or other entity and is in good standing (where such
concept is applicable) under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in
which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or
the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole.

2.1(b) The Subsidiaries of the Company listed in Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (the "

Companys Subsidiaries other than the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company has made available to Parent copies of its certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents (collectively, the "

filed by the Company on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval System (" _EDGAR_ ") in unredacted form, (ii) filed by the Company

been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company.

2.2(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions do or will, directly or
indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), (i) contravene,
conflict with, or result in a violation of (A) any provision of the
Organizational Documents of any of the Acquired Corporations, or (B) any
resolution adopted by the board of directors or the stockholders of any

Corporations, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi),

that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole.

and effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

SECTION 5: ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

5.1 _No Solicitation_.

5.1(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation __._ From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, except as set forth in this Section 5.1, none of the
Acquired Corporations shall, nor shall they authorize or permit any of the
Acquired Corporations directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
other advisors and representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly or intentionally encourage or facilitate,
any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation,
amending or granting any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock, except as expressly
permitted by this Section); or

(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any non-public information with
respect to, assist or  



 

38 EXECUTION COPY



 

 participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect to, or
otherwise knowingly or intentionally cooperate in any way with, any
Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that providing notice of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.1 to a third party in response to any
such inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a breach of this Section).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time that the Required Company
Stockholder Vote has been obtained (the " _Company Specified Time_ "), the
Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after
consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona fide written
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal, in each case that did not result from a breach by the
Company of, or actions by its Representatives inconsistent with, this Section,
and subject to compliance with Section 5.1(c), (x) furnish non-
public information with respect to the Acquired Corporations to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, in the case of either clause (x) or
(y), prior to taking such action the Company enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, the Company may, to the extent
required by the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board, as determined in
good faith by the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, waive
standstill provisions in effect with a third party whose identity has been
disclosed to Parent, in response to an unsolicited request from such third
party for such a waiver, provided such party has either made a Superior
Proposal or has expressed to the Company an intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall instruct its Representatives as to the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.1(a) and direct them to comply with its provisions and shall
thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to assure that the Company
Representatives comply with such instructions.

5.1(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(i) except as set forth in this Section, withdraw, qualify or modify, or
publicly announce its intention to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or the Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or any such committee of the adoption of this Agreement (a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");

(ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly announce its intention to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) authorize, cause or permit any of the Acquired Corporations to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section
5.1(a)).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Company Specified Time
and subject to compliance with Section 5.1(c), the Company Board may, in
response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.1, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board has concluded in good  



 

39 EXECUTION COPY



 

 faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has: (A)
complied in all material respects with this Section, (B) provided to Parent
five business days prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ "), which notice shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the then current
material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the Person making
the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new three business day period), (C) during such five business day period (or
three business day period, in the case of an amendment) if requested by
Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that any Acquisition Proposal which was determined to
constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (D) at the
end of such period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent following a Notice of
Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required by clause (C) or
otherwise).

In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
this Section 5.1, at any time prior to the Company Specified Time the Company
Board may, in response to a material development or change in circumstances
occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither known to the
Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof
(and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or
change in circumstances, a " _Company Intervening Event_ ") make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has concluded in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such
Company Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that, the
Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company
has (x) provided to Parent at least three business days prior written notice
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y) during such
three business day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this
Agreement, the Company Voting Undertakings or any other approval of the
Company Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing
any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar
statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including the Merger.

Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take
any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 5.1(b), or (B) affect any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement or (C) except upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(j), limit the Companys obligation to call, give notice of,

information included in the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the

reasonable prior notice, during the period from the date hereof through the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records in a manner commensurate with
due diligence conducted by any party prior to the date hereof.

interfere with the conduct of the business of the parties or their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (ii) create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries or (iii) involve any testing or sampling of the Environment (such

42 EXECUTION COPY



 

 otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that

any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information or (ii) access to a
contract to which any of the Acquired Corporations or Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default

under, such contract.

actions in accordance with Legal Requirements, the Organizational Documents

event within forty-five (45) days after the declaration of effectiveness of
the Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting Proposal (as defined
below). Subject to Section 5.1(b), to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, (i) the Company Board shall recommend adoption
of this Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company
Voting Proposal_ ") and include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (ii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii) the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the Required Company Stockholder Vote.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that
its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock, as required by this Section, shall not be
affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation
by the Company Board or committee thereof and (ii) the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

5.5(b) Parent, acting through Parents Board, shall take all actions in
accordance with Legal Requirements, the Organizational Documents of Parent and
the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market to promptly and duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
forty-five (45) days after the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4
Registration Statement, the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
considering and voting upon (i) the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger and (ii) the amendment of the Parents Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the number of authorized shares of Parent Common Stock by 150 million
shares (together, the " _Parent Voting Proposals_ "). Except as expressly
permitted by this Section 5.5(b), (i) the Parent Board shall recommend
approval of the Parent Voting Proposal by the stockholders of Parent and
include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii)
neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner
adverse to the Company the recommendation of the Parent Board that the
Parents stockholders vote in favor of the Parent Voting Proposals (any of
the foregoing, a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") and (iii) Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the Parent Voting Proposals and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the Required Parent Stockholder Vote.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the time that the Required
Parent Stockholder Votes have been obtained (the " _Parent Specified Time_
"), the Parent Board may, in response to (i) a proposal relating to an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Change of Control of Parent
and requiring as a condition thereof that Parent terminate this Agreement (a
" _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ ") or (ii) a material development or change in
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither
known to the Parent Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the
date hereof (and not relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal) (such
material development or change in circumstances, a " _Parent Intervening
Event_ "), make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if the Parent Board
has concluded in good faith, after  



 

43 EXECUTION COPY



 

 consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal or such Parent Intervening Event, the failure of the
Parent Board to effect such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ that, the Parent Board shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
this sentence unless Parent has (x) provided to the Company at least three
business days prior written notice advising the Company that the Parent Board
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail and (y) during such three business day period, if requested by the
Company, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change. Any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall not
change the approval of this Agreement, the Parent Voting Undertakings or any
other approval of the Parent Board, including in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger.

5.5(c) Nothing in Section 5.5(b) shall be deemed to (A) affect any other
obligation of Parent under this Agreement or (B) except upon a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(k), limit Parents obligation to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting, regardless
of whether the Parent Board has effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change.

5.5(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 or otherwise contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit Parent from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to Parents stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Parent Board, after consultation with outside counsel, such action is required
under applicable Legal Requirements.

5.5(e) Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties, the respective
record dates and meeting dates for the Company Stockholders Meeting and for
the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be the same.

5.5(f) Except to the extent required by Legal Requirements, the Company shall
not (i) change the date specified in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for
the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) postpone, delay or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting, except, in each case, after consultation with
Parent, (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus required by applicable Legal
Requirements is provided to the stockholders of the Company sufficiently in
advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) if there are an
insufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock represented in person or
by proxy at the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or to
adopt this Agreement, in which case the Company may adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a quorum
and/or the Required Company Stockholder Vote as promptly as practicable in the
prevailing circumstances. Except to the extent required by Legal
Requirements, Parent shall not (i) change the date specified in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the Parent Stockholders Meeting or (ii)
postpone, delay or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting, except, in each
case, after consultation with the Company, (A) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus required by applicable Legal Requirements is provided to
the stockholders of Parent sufficiently in advance of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting or (B) if there are an insufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum, in which case Parent may
adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain a quorum and/or the Required Parent Stockholder Votes as promptly as

pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including all
information required to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Form S-4 Registration Statement) in connection with the transactions

Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 5.6(a) shall modify or

cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances, approvals,
actions, or non-actions required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission

connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any

review in advance any communication given by the first party to, and consult
with the other party in advance of any meeting or conference with, the United

limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to conduct their

that are material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

5.6(d) At the request of Parent (which request shall be at Parents sole
discretion), the Acquired Corporations shall agree to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, or to take or agree to take any action
with respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any of their respective
businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, provided that any such action is

acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section,
none of the Acquired Corporations shall, without Parents prior written
consent, agree to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest
any of their respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets, or to take or
agree to take any action with respect to, or agree to any limitation on, any
of their respective businesses, Subsidiaries or assets.

other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange
to which Parent or the Company is a party, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being  



 

46 EXECUTION COPY



 

 understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party.

5.8 _Section 368(a) Reorganization_. Parent and Company shall each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization.

The NASDAQ Stock Market, file with The NASDAQ Stock Market a Notification
Form for Listing Additional Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common

Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or the Company

this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without Parents
prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

5.11 _Indemnification_.

5.11(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of six years
from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Companys obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
any of the Acquired Corporations (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
extent that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist at the
Effective Time.

5.11(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase "tail"
officers and directors liability insurance policies, which by their terms
shall survive the Merger and shall provide each Indemnified Person with
coverage for six years following the Effective Time on terms and conditions
no less favorable than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance (" _Tail Policies_ "), provided that the aggregate premium
for such Tail Policies shall not be greater than 225% of the annual premium
paid by the Company for such existing insurance, and provided, further, that
if 225% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such existing insurance
is not sufficient for such coverage, the Company shall spend up to
that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such
amount. The Tail Policies shall be endorsed, or follow form with an
endorsement, to be approved by Parent prior to the Effective Time, which
expressly provides Parent and Merger Sub with direct rights to access the
Tail Policies for Side B coverage and does not impair Side C rights of Parent
and Merger Sub as they may exist by operation of this Merger (as it is the
full intent of this Agreement that all insurance policy rights of Company
that are transferable shall be transferred). Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policies in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder for the full term
thereof. 

5.11(c) Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar Organizational Documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of  



 

47 EXECUTION COPY



 

 incorporation and bylaws (or other similar Organizational Documents) of the
Acquired Corporations immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, and
such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who
were covered by such provisions, except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

5.11(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.11.

5.11(e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. Parent shall guarantee the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any and all amounts payable
under this Section.

5.11(f) The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive consummation of the
Merger.

5.12 _Employee Matters __._ With respect to the employees of the Acquired
Corporations who remain employed after the Effective Time by the Acquired
Corporations following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
and to the extent not prohibited under the terms of Parents applicable
benefit plans, Parent shall treat and cause its applicable benefit plans to
treat the service of the Continuing Employees with the Acquired Corporations
prior to the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, including
applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, and solely for
purpose of welfare plans such as vacation and severance, for benefit accrual.
Continuing Employees shall receive employee benefits no less favorable then
those provided to similarly situated Parent employees. Parent shall, or shall
cause its applicable subsidiary to, assume and perform the Companys
employment and change in control agreements. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that no such Continuing Employee, or any of his
or her eligible dependents, who, at the Effective Time, are participating in
the Acquired Corporations group health plan shall be excluded from Parents
group health plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting
period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation and to provide credit
for any coinsurance and deductibles prior to the Effective Time but in the
same plan year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to
provide any coverage, benefits or credit inconsistent with the terms of any
Parent benefit plans. Furthermore, nothing contained in this Section shall
require or imply that the employment of the employees of the Acquired
Corporations who are employed at the Effective Time will continue for any
particular period of time following the Effective Time. This Section is not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereunder, or
to be interpreted as an amendment to any plan of Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent.

5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters __._ Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur causes, or would be reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality or that makes reference to a Material Adverse
Effect to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect that would cause any of the
