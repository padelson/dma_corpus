  **WHEREAS** , the Buyer desires to purchase all of the Shares from the

upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

  

  **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and
other agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

  

  **ARTICLE I.** 

 



 

  **SALE AND PURCHASE**

  ****

  ** SECTION 1.1. ** _Agreement to Sell and to Purchase_. On
the Closing Date and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the Seller shall (and the Seller Parent shall cause the
Seller to) sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the Shares, free

other legal or equitable encumbrances, limitations or restrictions of any
nature whatsoever (" **Encumbrances** "), to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall
purchase the Shares from the Seller.

 



  ** SECTION 1.2. ** _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of
the last sentence of Section 6.2(c), the closing of the sale and purchase of
the Shares (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at 10:00 A.M., three

represent and warrant to the Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date (or if made as of a specified date, such date), as follows:

 

  ** SECTION 2.1. ** _Organization and Qualification_. (a) Each

to own, use and lease its assets and properties, except for such failures to
be so organized, existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
which recognize the concept of good standing) or to have such power and
authority which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be

duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing

respect to jurisdictions which recognize the concept of good standing) which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

filings with the SEC a true and complete copy of each form, report,
schedule, registration statement, registration exemption, if applicable,
definitive proxy statement and other document (together with all amendments
thereof and supplements thereto) filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act since
March 31, 2003, and the draft annual report on Form 10-K of the Company,
dated May 20, 2005, labeled Draft No. 12, for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2005 (the " **Draft 2005 10-K** ") (as such documents have since the time of
their filing been amended or supplemented, the " **SEC Reports** "),
which are all the documents (other than preliminary materials) that the
Company and its Subsidiaries were required to file with the SEC since such
date. As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports (assuming, in the case of
the Draft 2005 10-K, that the Company's consolidated unaudited financial
statements contained therein for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 are
equivalent to audited financial statements) (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 Exchange Act (in each case, to the extent applicable), and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. For purposes of this Agreement, both the Draft 2005 10-K and
the Company's actual report annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2005 shall be deemed SEC Reports, with the Draft 2005 10-K
being assumed to have been filed with the SEC on May 20, 2005. The Seller
Parent has, on or before May 20, 2005, delivered to the Buyer the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
March 31, 2005 as contained in the Draft 2005 10-K (the " **FY 2005
Statements** "). The FY 2005 Statements and the audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case the notes, if any, thereto) included in the SEC
Reports (collectively, the " **Company Financial Statements** ") complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated therein or in the
notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements (other than the
FY 2005 Statements) as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act)
and fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to the absence of footnotes normally contained therein
and normal year-end audit adjustments (which are not expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole)) the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended. Except as set forth in Section 2.5 of the
Seller Parent Disclosure Letter, each Subsidiary of the Company is treated as
a consolidated subsidiary of the Company in the Company Financial Statements
for all periods covered thereby.

 



 

(b) The Company, its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures are in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or

permitted by the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Sections
13(k)(2) and (3) thereof, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has made, arranged or modified
(in any material way) personal loans to any executive officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) The Company its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures required to file
documents with or furnish documents to the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act (a " **Company Reporting Entity** ") has (i) designed
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to it and its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to its
management by others within those entities and (ii) to the extent required by
applicable laws, disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to its
auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) to the knowledge of the Seller Parent, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in such entity's internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 



 

(d) The Company and each Company Reporting Entity has complied with the
applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on or before
the date by which they must comply with such requirements.

copies of any written notifications it has received since December 31, 2002
of a (i) "reportable condition" or (ii) "material weakness" in the Company's

meanings assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards No. 60, as
in effect on the date hereof.

Subsidiaries since December 31, 2002 under the 1935 Act, the Power Act and

Wyoming), as the case may be, (ii) have been timely filed (in respect of
filings with the SEC and the FERC), and (iii) complied, as of
their respective dates, in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the appropriate statute and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

its Subsidiaries are engaged) the Company and its Subsidiaries), nor (ii) any
transaction that would have been prohibited by Section 4.1(a)(ii), (iii) or

of corporations (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** ")) that file consolidated
federal income Tax Returns and the Company and its Subsidiaries are members
of such group. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed, or has
joined in the filing of, all material Tax Returns required to be filed by or
with respect to it, or requests for extensions to file such Tax Returns have
been timely filed or granted and have not expired, and all Tax Returns are

extent not adequately reserved, the assessment of which has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

  (ii) Except as disclosed in Section 2.12 of the Seller Parent
Disclosure Letter or has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is obligated to make any payment, or is a party to any
agreement that obligates it to make any payments that will not be deductible
under Code Section 280G.

 

  (iii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on
its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give
rise to a substantial understatement of United States federal income tax
within the meaning of Code Section 6662 and the regulations in respect
thereof in existence on the date hereof.

 



  (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has in
any year for which the applicable statute of limitations remains open
distributed stock of another person, or has had its stock distributed by
another person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be
governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code.

 

  (v) All Taxes which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are required to withhold or collect, including, but not limited to, Taxes
required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to an
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party
and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or collected
and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper governmental
agency or are held in separate bank accounts for such purpose. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect
to such withheld Taxes.

 



  (vi) No claim has been made in writing by a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns such that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 



  (vii) No material Encumbrance for Taxes exists with respect
to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
Encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due and payable or Taxes being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves are being maintained on the most recent financial statements
contained in the SEC Reports or in the FY 2005 Statements.

 



  (viii) No closing agreements, private letter rulings,
technical advice memoranda or similar agreements or rulings with respect to
Taxes have been entered into with or issued by any governmental authority or
requested from any governmental authority with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
executed or filed any power of attorney with respect to Taxes which is
currently in force.

 



  (ix) The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have at all
times been, in compliance with the provisions of Sections 6011, 6111 and 6112
of the Code relating to tax shelter disclosure, registration and list
maintenance and with the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has at any time, engaged in or entered
into a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.6011-4(b)(2), 301.6111-2(b)(2) or 301.6112-1(b)(2)(A). No IRS Form
8886 has been filed with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 respect to any Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into any tax shelter or listed transaction with
the sole or dominant purpose of the avoidance or reduction of a Tax liability
in a jurisdiction outside the United States with respect to which there is
a significant risk of challenge of such transaction by a governmental
authority in a jurisdiction outside the United States.

 



 

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable
year or period ending on or before March 31, 2005 (or for any taxable year or
period beginning on or before and ending after March 31, 2005, the portion of
such taxable year or period) for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed do
not exceed in any material amount the reserve for actual Taxes (as opposed to
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) taken into account on the Company Financial
Statements.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.12 of the Seller Parent Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound
by or otherwise obligated under any Tax allocation, indemnity or sharing
agreement or any similar contract or arrangement. Section 2.12 of the Seller
Parent Disclosure Letter contains a true and correct copy of each agreement
listed therein. No amounts are or will be due by the Company or any
Subsidiary under any such agreement other than the Amended Tax Allocation
Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2004, by and among the Seller and its
Subsidiaries, a copy of which has been provided to the Buyer, and other than
amounts reserved for on the FY 2005 Statements. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income tax return (other than a group the common parent
of which is the Seller, or a predecessor thereof) or (ii) has any material
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than any member of the Seller
federal consolidated tax group) under United States Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision or state, local, or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  (a) _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_. Except as disclosed in

throughout the period from the date hereof to the Closing, (i) provide the
Buyer and its Representatives with full access, upon reasonable prior notice
and during normal business hours, to all officers, employees, agents and
accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the extent possible,
the Joint Ventures and their respective assets, properties, books and
records, but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures, (ii) furnish promptly to such persons
(x) a copy of each report, statement, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and each
material report, statement, schedule and other document filed with any other
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and (iii) upon request from the Buyer,
furnish to the Buyer audited financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each of the last three fiscal years ended prior to the date
of the request and unaudited quarterly financial information for such
periods, together with the related financial information, and to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company's auditors to
provide consents requested by the Buyer, and (y) all other information and
data (including, without limitation, copies of Contracts, Employee Benefit
Plans, and other books and records) concerning the business and operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures as the Buyer or any
of its Representatives reasonably may request. No investigation pursuant to
this paragraph or otherwise shall affect any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. Any such information or material obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.1 shall be governed by the terms of the letter agreement between
the Buyer and the Seller Parent relating to confidential information
concerning the Company (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ").

  ** SECTION 5.2. ** _Approval of Shareholders_.

 

  (a) The Seller Parent shall, through its Board of Directors,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a general meeting of its ordinary
shareholders (the " **Seller Parent Shareholders ' Meeting**"), for the
purpose of voting on and approving the Share Purchase (the " **Seller Parent
Shareholders ' Approval**"). Subject to Section 5.2(b), the Seller Parent
shall, through its Board of Directors, include in the Circular the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Seller Parent that the
shareholders of the Seller Parent approve the Share Purchase. The Seller
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval as
promptly as practicable but, in any event, on or before August 1, 2005, but
the failure to obtain such approval shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement.

 



  (b) The recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Seller
Parent included in the Circular (or if such Circular has not been dispatched,
the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Seller Parent described in
the first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 2.3) may be withdrawn
if the Board of Directors of the Seller Parent determines in good faith that
the failure to withdraw such recommendation (or resolution) could reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties by reason of an
unsolicited bona fide Alternative Proposal having been made; _provided_
, that:

 

  (i) in making its determination, the Board of Directors of
the Seller Parent shall conclude that the person or group making such
Alternative Proposal will have adequate sources of financing to consummate
such Alternative Proposal and, in that regard, the Seller Parent shall take
advice from and have regard to the opinion of its financial advisors;

 

(ii) such Board of Directors has reasonably concluded in good faith that
such Alternative Proposal is more favorable to the Seller Parent than the
Share Purchase contemplated hereby;

 



 

(iii) such Board of Directors shall have been advised by its external legal
counsel as to its applicable fiduciary duties and shall have been advised
that a failure to withdraw such resolution or recommendation as a result of
such Alternative Proposal could reasonably result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties; and

 



 

(iv) prior to any such withdrawal, the Seller Parent shall, and shall cause
its respective financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with the Buyer to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Seller Parent and the Seller to proceed with the transactions
contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 



 

(c) In connection with the Seller Parent Shareholders' Meeting, (i) the
Seller Parent shall promptly publish the Circular and dispatch the Circular
to its shareholders in compliance with all legal requirements applicable to
the Seller Parent Shareholders' Meeting and the Listing Rules and (ii) if
necessary, after the Circular has been so dispatched, promptly publish or
circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented materials and, if required in
connection therewith, resolicit votes. In the event that the Seller Parent
Shareholders' Approval is not obtained without the vote having been taken on
the date on which the Seller Parent Shareholders' Meeting is initially
convened, the Seller Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
adjourn such Seller Parent Shareholders' Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Seller Parent Shareholders' Approval and to use reasonable best efforts
during any such adjournments to promptly obtain the Seller Parent
Shareholders' Approval.

 



  ** SECTION 5.3. ** _Regulatory and Other Approvals_.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and without limiting
the provisions of Section 5.2, each of the Buyer and the Seller Parent
shall jointly, through the Joint Executive Committee, develop a regulatory
approval plan and proceed cooperatively and in good faith to, as promptly as
practicable, (i) obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all
filings with and give all notices to Governmental or Regulatory Authorities
or any other public or private third parties required of the Buyer, the
Seller, the Seller Parent, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or the Joint Ventures to consummate the Share Purchase and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation those set
forth on Section 2.4 of the Seller Parent Disclosure Letter), and (ii)
provide such other information and communications to such Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities or other public or private third parties as any of the
Seller, the Seller Parent or the Buyer or such Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities or other public or private third parties may reasonably request
in connection therewith. In addition to and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of the parties will (w) take promptly all actions necessary
to make the filings required of the Buyer, the Seller, the Seller Parent and
the Company or their Affiliates under the HSR Act and to comply with filing
and approval requirements of the FERC, the SEC, the FCC and each State
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, (x) comply at the earliest practicable
date with any request for additional information received by such person or
its affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission (the " **FTC** ") or
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
**Antitrust Division** ") pursuant to the HSR Act, (y) cooperate with each
other in connection with filings of the Buyer, the Seller Parent, the Seller,
the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries and any Joint Ventures under the HSR
Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
concerning the Share Purchase commenced by either the FTC or the Antitrust
Division or state attorneys general or by the FERC, the SEC, the FCC or any
State Governmental or Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction with respect
to the Share Purchase or another transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and (z) provide to the other promptly copies of all correspondence between
the Buyer (in the case of the Buyer so providing such information) or the
Seller Parent, the Seller, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries in the
Joint Venture (in the case of the Seller Parent providing such information)
and the applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority with respect to any
filings referred to in this Section 5.3, and shall give the Seller Parent or
the Buyer, as the case may be, the opportunity to review such filings and all
responses to requests for additional information by such Governmental or
Regulatory Authority prior to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 their being filed therewith. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Seller Parent and the Seller, jointly and
severally, shall not permit the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Joint
Ventures to incur any liability or obligation (other than ordinary and
reasonably attorneys' fees and other third party costs directly related to
the obtaining of necessary Final Orders from state public utility
commissions) or grant any state concessions or to enter into any agreement or
arrangement (including, without limitation, any amendment, waiver or
modification of the terms of any rate agreement, Order, Contract or Company
Permit) that has or is reasonably likely to have a "meaningful adverse
effect" on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, revenues, net income, results of operations or prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of the immediately
preceding sentence and the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(ii), "meaningful
adverse effect" shall be deemed to be equivalent to a material adverse effect
on an entity otherwise identical to the Company and its Subsidiaries but
having only 25% of the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, revenues, net income, results of operations and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

  ** SECTION 5.4. ** _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Buyer Agreements_. The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other than such plans in respect of
equity of the Company, the Seller or the Seller Parent (collectively, "
**Equity Plans** ")) in effect at the date of this Agreement that have been
disclosed to the Buyer prior to such date to remain in effect until the date
(the " **Termination Date** ") which is the later of 24 months after the
date of this Agreement or six months after the Closing. To the extent the
Buyer elects not to continue any such Company Employee Benefit Plans at any
time prior to the Termination Date, the Buyer will maintain benefit plans
during such period generally of the same type and of the same or comparable
aggregate value as the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other than Equity
Plans) not so continued, on terms substantially similar to those applicable
to other employees of the same general status of the Buyer or
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained herein
shall be construed as requiring the Buyer or the Company to continue any
specific plan or as preventing the Buyer or the Company from (i) establishing
and, if necessary, seeking shareholder approval to establish, any other
benefit plans in respect of all or any of the employees covered by such
Company Employee Benefit Plans or any other employees, (ii) amending such
Company Employee Benefit Plans (or any replacement benefit plans thereof)
where required by applicable law including, without limitation,
any amendments necessary to avoid application of Section 409A of the Code, or
where such amendment is with the consent of the affected employees or as
otherwise effected in accordance with the terms of such plans, or (iii)
amending the Company Employee Benefit Plans in the ordinary course of
business so long as the second sentence of this Section 5.4(a) remains true.
From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its express terms, each existing
collective bargaining, employment, change of control, severance and
termination agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any
representative union, officer, director or employee of such company,
including without limitation all legal and contractual obligations pursuant
to outstanding restoration plans, severance plans, bonus deferral plans,
vested and accrued benefits and similar employment and benefit arrangements,
policies and agreements that have been disclosed to the Buyer as of the date
hereof and other obligations entered into in accordance with Section 4.1(i).

Centralia coal mine or the Centralia steam electric generating plant or any

Subsidiary or retired while an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary from
a business other than a business relating to the Centralia coal mine or the
Centralia steam electric generating plant or any of the businesses related

(ii) _General_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Seller Parent
hereby agrees to assume, or to cause a Transferred Group Entity to assume,
all liabilities (regardless of when or where such liabilities arose or arise
or were or are incurred) accrued or earned by, whether vested or unvested,
Transferred Individuals under the Employee Benefit Plan, to the extent a
Transferred Group Entity has not previously funded such liability by payment
to the Company or any Subsidiary (it being understood that with respect to
claims made by participants under any Employee Benefit Plans which are fully
insured welfare benefit plans, all liabilities arising from claims made prior
to the Closing shall remain liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Effective as of the Closing Date, each Transferred Group Entity shall cease
to be a "participating employer" in the Employee Benefit Plans.

 



 

(iii) _Defined Benefit Plan Assets_.

 



 (A) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Seller Parent
shall cause the transfer of a reasonably representative cross-section of
assets from the trust of the Company's Retirement Plan to the trust of the
Transferred Group Pension Plan in an amount equal to the amount of trust
assets required to be transferred as of the Closing Date in respect of the
Transferred Individuals under Section 414(1) of the Code, using (to the
extent permitted thereunder) the "safe harbor" rates and assumptions set
forth in the regulations under Section 4044 of ERISA increased by a
reasonable rate of interest agreed upon by the Plan Actuary and the Buyer
Actuary (or if they cannot agree, the independent third party
actuary described below) from the Closing to the date of transfer (the "
**Pension Transfer Amount** ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

  (B) For purposes of this Section 5.4(b)(iii), the amount
transferred shall be determined by the actuary for the Company's Retirement
Plan (the " **Plan Actuary** "),  _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Plan
Actuary shall provide the actuary selected by the Buyer (the "
**Buyer Actuary** ") with all documentation reasonably necessary for the
Buyer Actuary to verify the Pension Transfer Amount; _ provided_ , 
_further_ ,  _however_ , that if the Buyer Actuary certifies, in writing
within 30 days of receiving such supporting documentation, that the Buyer
Actuary disagrees with the Plan Actuary's determination of the Pension
Transfer Amount then, first the Seller Parent and the Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute, and if unable to come to an agreement,
then the Buyer and the Seller Parent shall select an independent third
enrolled actuary to settle such disagreement. The determination of such third
actuary shall be binding on the Buyer and the Seller Parent. The fees, costs
and expenses of said third actuary shall be divided equally between the Buyer
and the Seller Parent.

 

 

(iv) _Defined Contribution Plan Accounts_. On or prior to the Closing, the
Seller Parent shall cause the accounts (including any outstanding loans) of
the Transferred Individuals under the Company's Employee Savings and Stock
Ownership Plan which are held by its related trust to be transferred to the
Transferred Group Savings Plan and its related trusts. The amounts to be
transferred pursuant to this Section 5.4(b)(iv) shall be in kind.

 



 

(v) _Post Retirement Welfare Plans Assets_.

 



 

 (A) On or prior to the Closing, the Seller Parent shall cause the transfer in kind from each of the Company's voluntary employee benefits associations (" **VEBAs** ") and 401(h) accounts under any qualified pension plan (with VEBAs, " **Funded Accounts** ") to one or more Funded Accounts established by any Transferred Group Entity for the purpose of funding the liabilities under the Transferred Group Post Retirement Welfare Plans, an amount (the " **Medical Transfer Amount** ") equal to the fair market value of the assets of the Company's Funded Accounts, determined as of the date of such transfer, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the difference between (a) the aggregate contributions made by each Transferred Group Entity to the Company's Funded Accounts, and (b) the aggregate distributions made to Transferred Individuals from the Company's Funded Accounts, and the denominator of which shall be the difference between (x) the aggregate contributions made to the Company's Funded Accounts, and (y) the aggregate distributions made from the Company's Funded Accounts.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 



 

 (B) For purposes of this Section 5.4(b)(v), the amount transferred shall be determined by the Plan Actuary; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Plan Actuary shall provide the Buyer Actuary with all documentation reasonably necessary for the Buyer Actuary to verify the Medical Transfer Amount; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ , that if the Buyer Actuary certifies, in writing within 30 days of receiving such supporting documentation, that the Buyer Actuary disagrees with the Plan Actuary's determination of the Medical Transfer Amount then, first the Seller Parent and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute, and if unable to come to an agreement, then the Buyer and the Seller Parent shall select an independent third enrolled actuary to settle such disagreement. The determination of such third actuary shall be binding on the Buyer and the Seller Parent. The fees, costs and expenses of said third actuary shall be divided equally between the Buyer and the Seller Parent. If, as a result of any dispute under this Section 5.4(b)(v), the asset transfer contemplated hereby is delayed until after the Closing, the amount that should have been transferred to the Funded Account of any Transferred Group Entity shall be increased by a reasonable rate of interest agreed upon by the Plan Actuary and Buyer Actuary (or if they cannot agree, the independent third party actuary described above) from the Closing to the date of transfer.

 



 

(vi) _Additional Contributions to the Company Retirement Plan_. Following
the date hereof and through the Closing, upon the written request of the
Buyer, the Seller Parent shall cause the Company to make any
additional contributions to the Company's Retirement Plan necessary to avoid
the requirement to provide participants with notice under Section 4011 of
ERISA. The Company shall be permitted to incur indebtedness, in an amount not
to exceed the amount of such requested contribution, in addition to the
indebtedness otherwise permitted by Section 4.1(h) on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to fund such contribution.

 



 

(c) The Seller Parent shall have caused the Company, on or before October
31, 2005, to take such actions as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Seller
Parent Disclosure Letter.

 



  ** SECTION 5.5. ** _Directors ' and Officers'
Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent required by law, until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing, Buyer will not take any action so as to amend, modify or repeal the
provisions for indemnification of directors or officers contained in the
Organizational Documents of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in such a
manner as would adversely affect the rights of any individual who shall have
served as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing to be indemnified by such corporations in respect of
their serving in such capacities prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company, until the
sixth anniversary of the Closing, to cause to be maintained in effect, to the
extent available, the policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof (or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms that are no less favorable to the insured parties) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Buyer be obligated to cause the Company
to expend in order to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this
paragraph any amount per annum in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the
aggregate premiums payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries in 2004 for
such purpose.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the Seller Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, bring or continue legal proceedings
against any director or officer of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
benefiting from the agreements in Section 5.5(a) or (b), such that any such
person could reasonably have a claim against any insurer in respect of the
insurance policies described in Section 5.5(b) or against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (whether by way of indemnity, contract, operation of law
or otherwise).

 



  ** SECTION 5.6. ** _Additional Matters_. Immediately
following the Closing, the Company's headquarters shall continue to be
located in Portland, Oregon. If requested by the Buyer, on or prior to
the Closing Date, the Seller Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause those trustees of The PacifiCorp Foundation designated by the Buyer in
writing at least three days before the Closing to resign and cause to be
appointed designees of the Buyer in their place.

 

  ** SECTION 5.7. ** _Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section
7.2, whether or not the Closing occurs, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
any Alternative Proposal by the Buyer on the one hand, or the Seller Parent,
the Seller, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries on the other,
shall be paid by the Buyer or the Seller Parent, as the case may be;
_provided_ , that, subject to Section 5.3, any and all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which are
necessary to obtain the consents of Governmental or Regulatory Authorities
required to consummate the Share Purchase and incurred after the date hereof
shall be paid by the Company.

 



  ** SECTION 5.8. ** _Brokers or Finders_. Each of the Buyer
and the Seller Parent represents, as to itself and its affiliates, that no
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person
is or will be entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any
other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except Houlihan Lokey Howard and
Zukin, whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Buyer in accordance with
the Buyer's agreement with such firm, and Morgan Stanley and UBS, each of
whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Seller Parent in accordance with
the Seller Parent's agreement with such firm, and the Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Parent and the Seller from and against, and the
Seller Parent shall indemnify and hold the Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against, any and all claims, liabilities or obligations
with respect to any other such fee or commission or expenses related thereto
asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement alleged to have
been made by such party or its affiliate.

 

  ** SECTION 5.9. ** _Conveyance Taxes_. The Buyer shall, and
the Seller Parent and the Seller, jointly and severally, shall, and shall
cause the Company to, cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding
any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer and stamp taxes and duties, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees, and any similar taxes or fees (including any penalties and
interest thereon) which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

initiating any general rate case and to consult with the Buyer prior to
making any material changes in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' rates or
charges, standards of service or accounting from those in effect on the date
hereof and to further consult with the Buyer prior to making any filing (or
any amendment thereto), or effecting any agreement, commitment, arrangement
or consent, whether written or oral, formal or informal, with respect
thereto.

 



  ** SECTION 5.11. ** _Seller Parent Cure_. If the condition
to closing in Section 6.1(d)(ii), Section 6.2(a) (as a result of the breach
or inaccuracy of the representation and warranty in Section 2.6(a)(i))
or 6.2(c) is not fulfilled at Closing, the Seller Parent (at it or the
Seller's sole cost and expense) may, but shall not be required to, make such
payments to the Company to promptly cure such inaccuracy or breach;
_provided_ , that such payment, in the Buyer's reasonable judgment, cures
such inaccuracy or breach.

 



  ** SECTION 5.12. ** _Post Closing Payments_.

 



 

 

(a) On each anniversary of the Closing Date until and including the twenty-
fifth anniversary thereof, the Seller shall cause the Seller's wholly owned
subsidiary, PacifiCorp Financial Services, Inc. (" **PFS** "), to pay to the
Buyer cash in the amount of $4.0 million. Without limiting the Buyer's rights
and remedies at law and in equity, (i) PFS shall pay interest on any amount
otherwise due and payable pursuant to this Section 5.12(a) at an annual rate
equal to the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank at the time such payment was
due and payable plus two percent (2%), accruing from the due date to the date
of payment, and (ii) all amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section
5.12 shall become immediately due and payable, at the option of the Buyer, on
the date that is 30 days after the Buyer gives a second notice to the Seller
Parent notifying the Seller Parent of such default (which notice may not be
given sooner than 60 days after the scheduled due date or sooner than 15
days after a first default notice) and advising of the Buyer's election to
accelerate the remaining amounts due under this Section 5.12 to the date that
is 30 days after the date of the notice unless all amounts required to be
paid have been paid on or before the date that is 90 days after the date on
which such amounts are required to be paid pursuant to this Section 5.12(a).

 

 

(b) The Seller Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees and
agrees to pay in full to the Buyer all of the payments owing under Section
5.12(a) as and when due, regardless of any defense, right of set off or
counterclaim that any of the Seller Parent, the Seller, PacifiCorp Financial
Services Inc. or any their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries may
have or assert.

 



  ** SECTION 5.13. ** _Tax Returns_. (a) The Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, (1) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its

all applicable extensions), and (2) all combined, consolidated or unitary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 income Tax Returns under federal, state, local or foreign law that include
Seller or any Affiliate and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Unless
the written consent of the Buyer is obtained, all such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Seller
prepared or filed, or had caused to be prepared and filed, such Tax Returns
for prior periods. No later than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date
of such Tax Returns, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with copies of (A) in
the case of consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns that include the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pro forma materials for the Company and
its Subsidiaries to be included in such consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns and (B) all other Tax Returns prepared or caused to be prepared by
the Seller pursuant to this Section 5.13. and (C) such workpapers and other
documents as may be reasonably necessary to determine the accuracy and
completeness of such materials or Tax Returns. If the Buyer notifies the
Seller Parent in writing within 14 days after receiving such materials or a
Tax Return of any comments of the Buyer, the Seller Parent shall cause any
such reasonable comments provided by the Buyer to be incorporated therein. If
the Seller Parent disputes the reasonableness of any such comment by the
Buyer, such dispute shall be resolved by an accounting firm or law firm
mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller Parent. Such Tax Returns (or
any amendments to such return) shall be filed in a manner consistent with
resolution of such dispute; provided, however, that Seller Parent may filed a
combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return in an inconsistent manner but
in such event, the tax sharing payment to be made by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be made in a manner and amount consistent with the
resolution of the dispute. ** ** The Buyer shall be responsible for filing
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date other than such Tax Returns
described in the first sentence of this Section 5.13. The Buyer and the
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with, and shall cause the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees and
representatives to reasonably cooperate with, the Seller or the Buyer, as the
case may be, with respect to the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Upon reasonable written request, the Seller
and the Buyer shall share information with the other party, to the extent
reasonably necessary to enable each party to satisfy its respective
Tax filing requirements.

 

(a) _Amended Tax Returns_. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate shall (or shall
cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to any taxable period ending on or before March 31,
2005 or with respect to any taxable period that begins before and ends after
March 31, 2005 without the written consent of the Seller Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

 

(b) _Tax Elections_. Except as required by law, Buyer shall not, without
the prior consent of Seller Parent (which may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, withhold such consent), make, or cause to permit to be made, any
Tax election, or adopt or change any method of accounting, or undertake any
other extraordinary action on the Closing Date, that would adversely affect
the Seller, whether directly or by reason of any indemnification obligation.

 



  ** SECTION 5.14. ** _Intercompany Items_. On the Closing
Date, the Seller Parent shall pay and cause its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company or its Subsidiaries) to pay to the Company and its Subsidiaries

date which is twelve (12) months following the date of this Agreement if the

of the parties to satisfy any of the required regulatory conditions precedent
to the obligation to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether such approvals be state or federal) and/or otherwise directly or
indirectly creates or imposes additional conditionality or costs which gives
rise to an entitlement on the part of the Buyer such that the Buyer chooses

(b) Notwithstanding the Closing or the delivery of the Shares and regardless
of any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the Seller Parent or
the Seller of any knowledge or information that the Seller Parent or the
Seller may have, the Buyer shall indemnify and agree to defend, save and hold
the Seller Parent and the Seller and their officers, directors, employees,

52  

 

 



 

(ii) any failure by the Buyer to perform or observe any term, provision,

Buyer's aggregate liability under Section 8.2(b)(i) shall not, in either
case, exceed 50% of the Purchase Price (the " **Cap** ");  _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Cap shall not be applicable to breaches of the
representations and warranties described in clause (a) of the first proviso
to Section 8.1 or of the representations and warranties in the first two
sentences of Section 2.12(c);

 



 

(ii) no indemnification for any Losses shall be asserted against:

 



 (x) the Seller Parent under Section 8.2(a)(i) or against the Buyer under
Section 8.2(b)(i) unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of such
Losses (other than those arising from breaches described in the penultimate
sentence of this Section 8.2(c)(ii)) exceeds $50 million (the " **Threshold**
"), at which point the Seller Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall
be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller

in excess of $25 million (the " **Deductible** "), subject to the limitation
in Section 8.2(c)(i);

 

 (y) the Seller Parent under Section 8.2(a) (other than in respect of a
breach of Section 4.1(a)(viii) or of the Seller Parent's or the Seller's

completely disregarded for the purposes of contributing toward the Threshold;
or

 

 (z) the Seller Parent under Section 8.2(a)(ii) or the Buyer under Section
8.2(b)(ii) unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of Loss in
respect of claims arising under Section 8.2(a)(ii) or 8.2(b)(ii), as the case
may be, and not arising from breaches described in the last sentence of this
Section 8.2(c)(ii), exceeds $7.5 million (the " **Covenant Deductible** ");

 

  _provided_ , that for purposes of the immediately preceding clauses (y)
and (z), a covenant shall be deemed breached without regard to any qualifier
therein as to "materiality," "material adverse effect" or any derivative of
such terms. The Threshold and the Deductible shall not be applicable to
breaches of the representations and warranties described in clause (a) of the
first proviso to Section 8.1 and the first two sentences of Section 2.12(c).
The Covenant Deductible shall not be applicable to breaches of Section
4.1(a)(viii), Section 5.3 or the covenants described in clause (a) of the

53  

 

 



 

(iii) no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced (A) against
the Seller Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(a), unless written notice of such
claim or action is received by the Seller Parent describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
claim or action and the basis upon which indemnity is claimed on or prior to
the date on which the representation, warranty, covenant or condition on
which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section
8.1 (it being agreed and understood that if a claim for a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or condition is timely made, the
representation, warranty, covenant or condition shall survive until the date
on which such claim is finally liquidated or otherwise resolved), or (B)
against the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(b), unless written notice of such
claim or action is received by the Buyer describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or
action and the basis upon which indemnity is claimed on or prior to the date
on which the representation, warranty, covenant or condition on which such
claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.1 (it
being agreed and understood that if a claim for a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or condition is timely made, the representation or
warranty shall survive until the date on which such claim is finally
liquidated or otherwise resolved);

 



 

(iv) an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple recovery for the same Losses;

 



 

(v) a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
recover any Loss arising from the breach or inaccuracy of the Seller Parent's
or the Seller's representations and warranties if such breach or inaccuracy
resulted from (x) the effects of the transactions expressly permitted by
Sections 4.1(d) through (k), inclusive, or (y) obtaining any consent or
approval in respect of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures of
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority and, in respect of which consent or
approval, the actions taken by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Joint
Ventures were approved by the Buyer or the Joint Executive Committee as
provided in Section 4.8 or 5.3, as the case may be;

 



 

(vi) each of the Buyer and Seller Parent, as the case may be, shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate Loss otherwise subject to
indemnification hereunder. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
reasonably cooperate with the Seller Parent in recovering from the Company's
insurers (other than the Buyer and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or other third parties (including with respect to enforcement
of the Company's indemnification rights), in each case to the extent the same
are liable therefor, any Loss paid by the Seller Parent pursuant to this
Article VIII; _provided_ , that the Seller Parent promptly reimburses the
Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, for any third party cost or expense
incurred by any of them or the Company's Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, refrain from
searching for environmental hazards on the property of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures except, (x) as required by law, (y) in
connection with any financing, sale or lease in respect of any such property,
or (z) at any time after the Buyer, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, or any Joint Venture becomes aware of the
reasonable possibility of any such hazard existing, in each case, in the
exercise of their prudent business judgment;

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 



 

(vii) Seller will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including interest
received thereon) in respect of any taxable period ending on or prior to
March 31, 2005, except to the extent any such credit or refund is
specifically reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in the FY
2005 Statements;

 



 

(viii) it is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment
made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file
their Tax Returns accordingly;

 



 

(ix) the amount of any Loss shall be reduced by the Tax benefit actually
realized by a Buyer Indemnified Party where a Buyer Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party where a Seller Indemnified
Party is the Indemnified Party. If there is no reduction in the amount of any
indemnified Loss at the time an indemnification payment is made because no
Tax benefit is actually realized in the Tax year for which the payment was
made, the Indemnified Party will pay the Indemnifying Party an amount equal
to any Tax benefit realized in each subsequent Tax year at the time the Tax
Return for each subsequent Tax year is due (without regard to extensions). In
computing the amount of any Tax benefit, a person shall be deemed to realize
the benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any amount for which
indemnification is requested pursuant to this Section 8.2 after the use of
all other items of loss, deduction and credit of such Indemnified Party,
including net operating loss carryforwards. The Indemnified Party will
determine in good faith the time and amount of any Tax benefit actually
realized in any given year and will provide a summary explanation of such
determination to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes
the computation of such benefit by the Indemnified Party, such dispute shall
be resolved by an accounting firm or law firm mutually agreed upon by the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(x) a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover under Section
8.2(a)(i) any incremental environmental remediation or corrective action
costs associated with a material change in the use of the subject parcels
from the use of the subject parcels as of the Closing Date; and

 



 

(xi) the indemnification obligations of the Seller Parent hereunder shall
include any Losses (otherwise subject to the Seller Parent's indemnification
obligations hereunder) which are paid or became payable or are otherwise
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time after March 31, 2005.

 



  ** SECTION 8.3. ** _Procedures_. The person providing (as
required to provide) indemnification in respect of a claim pursuant to this
Article VIII as herein called, in respect of such claim, the "
**Indemnifying Party** ". Each Buyer Indemnified Party and each Seller
Indemnified Party is, in respect of a claim for which indemnification is
sought, is herein called, in respect of such claim, an "
**Indemnified Party** ". Any Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party (with reasonable specificity) promptly after it becomes aware of facts
supporting a claim or action for indemnification under this Article VIII, and
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all
information and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify any Losses
associated with such claim or action. Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iii), the
failure to so notify or provide information to the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by the Indemnified
Party's failure to give such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the extent of such
material prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall defend, contest or otherwise
protect the Indemnified Party against any such claim or action by counsel of
the Indemnifying Party's choice at its sole cost and expense;  _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or
compromise without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party has
unconditionally acknowledged liability pursuant to the terms of this Article
VIII. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the
Indemnified Party's choice and shall in any event use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party. If (a) the
Indemnifying Party fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect
against such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, (b) the Indemnifying Party
fails to state in a written notice given to the Indemnified Party not later
than 20 days after the Indemnified Party received notice of a claim pursuant
to Section 8.2(c)(iii) that the claim is properly the subject
of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (subject only to the Cap,
Threshold or Deductible, if applicable), (c) in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnified Party there are conflicts of interest (other than as a result
of this Article VIII) between the interests of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, or (d) the claim is not solely
for monetary relief or the claim involves a criminal matter, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to control the defense of such claim with counsel
of its own choosing, including, without limitation, the right to make any
compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and amounts
paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding.

 

  ** SECTION 8.4. ** _Remedy_. Absent fraud, and except for
seeking equitable relief, from and after the Closing the sole remedy of a
party in connection with (i) a breach or inaccuracy of the representations or
warranties in this Agreement or any certificates or other documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement at Closing, or (ii) any failure by a party to
perform or observe any term, provision, covenant, or agreement on the part of
such party to be performed or observed under this Agreement, shall, in each
case, be as set forth in this Article VIII.

 



  ** SECTION 8.5. ** _Limitation on Claims_. The Seller Parent
and Seller shall not be liable pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) for any Loss in
respect of any matter hereunder to the extent that:

 



 

(a) such Loss arises or, such Loss otherwise having arisen, is increased as
a result of any change made after Closing in any accounting or taxation
policies or accounting or taxation practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any other member of the Company's consolidated tax group,
save to the extent that any such change is 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 



 required to bring the accounting or taxation policies or accounting or
taxation practice of that company into line with U.S. generally accepted
accounting or taxation policies or accounting or taxation practice or any Tax
law (as the case may be) as at the Closing Date; or

 



 

(b) such Loss is recovered through a rate increase expressly attributable to
such Loss that is approved by the applicable state Governmental or Regulatory
Authority (and, to the extent the Seller Parent has made any payment pursuant
to this Article VIII in respect of such Loss before such recovery, the Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Party receiving such recovery, to
pay the same over to the Seller Parent).

 



  ** SECTION 8.6. ** _Release of Directors_. The Buyer shall
cause the Company to release each director of the Company who resigns at the
Closing from any and all liability the same may have to the Company as a
director thereof arising on or before the Closing other than liabilities
arising from his negligence, recklessness, criminal conduct or self-dealing;
_provided_ , that (a) nothing in said release shall increase the obligations
of the Buyer or of the Company under Section 5.5 or the liability of any
insurer to such director in respect of any insurance policy described in
Section 5.5(b) and (ii) such director releases the Company and its affiliates
from any and all liabilities arising on or before the Closing for
compensation of any nature (including directors' fees) or any reimbursement
of expenses.
