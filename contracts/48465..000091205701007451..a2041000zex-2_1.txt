taxation, the Escrow Amount, together  with any investment income thereon,
shall constitute Merger  Consideration under this Agreement which is
contingent upon  disbursement to the Company Shareholders from the Escrow 
Fund on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement  and the Escrow
Agreement.   (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned or held in  treasury by the
Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary  of the Company shall be
canceled and extinguished, and no  payment shall be made with respect
thereto.   (d) Each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of Merger Sub 
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable  (subject to Section
180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Statutes)  share of common stock, $.10 par
value, of the Surviving  Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON
STOCK").  2.02 DISSENTING SHARES.   (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if  Section 180.1302 of the Wisconsin Statutes
shall be  applicable to the Merger, shares of Company Common Stock  that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time and which are
held by Company Shareholders  who have not consented to the Merger or, in the
event a  meeting of Shareholders is held to approve the Merger, have  not
voted such shares in favor of the Merger, who shall have  delivered a written
demand for the fair value of such shares  in the manner provided in Section
180.1323 of the Wisconsin  Statutes, who shall have submitted such shares
for  endorsement, and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not  have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissenters\'  rights ("DISSENTING
SHARES") shall not be converted into or  represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, but the holders
thereof  shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by  Section
180.1325 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Each holder of    6     Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such  shares pursuant to Section
180.1325 of the Wisconsin  Statutes shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving  Corporation in accordance with the Wisconsin Statutes;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if any such holder of Dissenting  Shares shall have effectively
withdrawn such holder\'s demand  for appraisal of such shares (with the
consent of the  Company) or lost such holder\'s right to appraisal and 
payment of such shares, such holder or holders (as the case  may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares  and each such share shall
thereupon be deemed to have been  canceled, extinguished and converted, as of
the Effective  Time, into and represent the right to receive payment from 
the Surviving Corporation of the Merger Consideration, as  provided in
Section 2.01 hereof.   (b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of
any written  demand for fair value, any withdrawal of a demand for fair 
value and any other instrument served pursuant to Section  180.1323 of the
Wisconsin Statutes received by the Company and  (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and  proceedings with respect to demands for fair
value under  Section 180.1325 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The Company shall 
not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer,  voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demand for  fair value or offer to settle or
settle any such demand.  2.03 PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR COMPANY
COMMON STOCK.   (a) After the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate
or  certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock  canceled and
extinguished at the Effective Time pursuant to  Section 2.01(a) hereof (each,
a "CERTIFICATE") may surrender  such Certificate or Certificates to Buyer, as
agent for the  holders of shares of Company Common Stock, to effect the 
exchange of such Certificate or Certificates on such holder\'s  behalf. Buyer
shall, promptly, but in no event more than five  (5) business days, after
approval of the Merger by the Company  Shareholders, cause to be distributed
to such shareholders  appropriate materials to facilitate such surrender and
will  process such materials promptly after receipt thereof  ("TRANSMITTAL
MATERIALS"). After surrender to Buyer of any  Certificate after the Effective
Time, together with the  completed Transmittal Materials, subject to the
provisions of  Section 2.02(a) hereof, Buyer shall distribute to the person 
in whose name such Certificate shall have been registered, an  amount in
cash, either by check or wire transfer of  immediately available funds, at
the election of such person,  to an account or accounts designated by such
person,  representing the amount in cash into which the shares of  Company
Common Stock represented thereby shall have been  converted at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 2.01(a)  hereof, less the amount of cash deposited
by Buyer with the  Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.01(b) hereof. In the
case  of Certificates surrendered on the Closing, so long as Buyer  has
received, at least three business days prior to the  Effective Time, written
notice from a Company Shareholder that  such shareholder will    7    
surrender its Certificates to Buyer on the Closing (which  notice shall
include completed Transmittal Materials and  contain wire transfer and
account instructions or in the case  of check, delivery instructions), Buyer
shall distribute on  the Closing Date to the person in whose name such
Certificate  shall have been registered, an amount in cash, either by check 
or wire transfer of immediately available funds, at the  election of such
person to an account or accounts designated  by such person, representing the
amount in cash into which the  shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby shall have  been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to
Section  2.01(a) hereof, less the amount of cash deposited by Buyer  with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.01(b) hereof.  Until so surrendered
and exchanged, each outstanding  Certificate shall be deemed to represent and
evidence only  the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid 
therefor as set forth in Section 2.01 and, until such  surrender and
exchange, no amount of Merger Consideration  shall be paid to the holder of
such outstanding Certificate in  respect thereof.   (b) If payment of any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be  made to a person other than the
person in whose name the  certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it  shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate
so  surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper  form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment  shall pay to Buyer any
transfer and other taxes required by  reason of such payment in any name
other than that of the  registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have  established to the satisfaction of Buyer that such tax either 
has been paid or is not payable.   (c) No interest shall accrue or be
payable with respect to any  amounts which any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock  shall be so entitled to receive. Buyer shall be authorized to 
pay the cash attributable to any Certificate theretofore  issued which has
been lost or destroyed, upon receipt of  satisfactory evidence of ownership
of the shares of Company  Common Stock represented thereby and of
appropriate  indemnification.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the  stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
the  shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding  immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are  presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled  and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this  Section 2.03, subject to applicable law in the case of  Dissenting
Shares.   (e) If a holder of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
become  entitled to receive payment for such shares pursuant to  Section
180.1325 of the Wisconsin Statutes and Section 2.02  hereof, such payment
shall be made by the Surviving  Corporation in accordance with Section 2.02
hereof.    8     ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

the Company  shall agree on (i) the requirements, if any, to Remediate (as 
defined in Section 5.14(f)(i) below) each Environmental  Condition (as
defined in Section 5.14(f)(ii) below) and (ii) a  scope of work setting forth
such agreed upon approach to  Remediate each such Environmental Condition
(the "REMEDIATION  SCOPE OF WORK"). The Remediation Scope of Work shall
include,  without limitation, identification of the actions necessary to 
complete the Remediation, such that a Closure Determination  under Section
5.14(g) hereof is issued, and a proposed  schedule for the performance of the
Remediation. The Company  and Buyer agree to utilize and accept the services
of URS (or  such other service provider upon which the parties mutually 
agree) as the environmental consultant (the "ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSULTANT") that

Remediation. In the event that  it is necessary after the date hereof to
modify or amend the  Remediation Scope of Work agreed upon pursuant to this

Remediation required under this Agreement or to obtain a  Closure
Determination pursuant to Section 5.14(g) hereof, any  such modification or
amendment shall be in writing and shall  be mutually agreed by Buyer and the

either  Buyer or the Company Shareholders).   (d) Subject to the terms of
this Section 5.14(d), the Company  Shareholders, at their sole cost and
expense, shall Remediate,  in a manner mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Company  Shareholders (which agreement shall not be unreasonably  withheld

Conditions associated with each parcel of  the Assessed Real Property
(including, without limitation, the  land and any improvements located
thereon) that have been  identified as conditions to be Remediated in
accordance with  the Remediation Scope of Work set forth in EXHIBIT I-2
(each,  a "REMEDIABLE CONDITION"); PROVIDED that, the maximum  aggregate
liability of the Company Shareholders for such  Remediation shall be $2.0
million, as provided by the  Environmental Remediation Escrow Amount. The
Company    48     Shareholders shall complete, or cause to be
completed, the  Remediation of all Remediable Conditions in accordance with 
the Remediation Scope of Work. The parties acknowledge and  agree that the
Company Shareholders shall contract with the  Environmental Consultant to
supervise and implement the  Remediation of the Remediable Conditions
required by the  Remediation Scope of Work, and that the Environmental 
Consultant shall consult regularly with Buyer\'s designated  representative
to keep such representative apprised of the  status of such Remediation and
to permit such representative  to address any issues or recommendations with
respect to such  Remediation. As of the date hereof, Buyer and the Company 
Shareholders have mutually agreed upon the Remediation Scope  of Work set
forth in EXHIBIT I-2, which Remediation Scope of  Work may only be modified,
if necessary, in accordance with  the terms of Section 5.14(c) hereof. The
Company Shareholders  shall cause the Remediation of the Remediable
Conditions  required hereunder to be commenced promptly after, but not 
prior to, the Effective Time, and shall cause such Remediation  to be
completed as soon as is practicable thereafter; PROVIDED  that, the Company
Shareholders and Buyer shall mutually agree  in advance on the schedule for
the work activities comprising  such Remediation at each parcel of the
Assessed Real Property.  The Company Shareholders\' obligation to Remediate
each  Remediable Condition shall terminate upon the earlier of (i)  the
aggregate expenditure of $2.0 million for such  Remediation, such that the
Environmental Remediation Escrow  Amount has been exhausted, or (ii) the
issuance of a Closure  Determination with respect to each Remediable
Condition at the  Assessed Real Property; PROVIDED that, if the Company 
Shareholders\' obligation to Remediate the Remediable  Conditions were to be
terminated under clause (i) of this  sentence, the Company Shareholders shall
remain obligated to  cooperate with the Company and the Buyer to obtain a
Closure  Determination with respect to each Remediable Condition for  which
Remediation has been completed prior to exhaustion of  the Environmental
Remediation Escrow Amount, provided that  such cooperation shall be at the
expense of the Buyer.   (e) The Company Shareholders shall undertake and
complete the  Remediation of the Remediable Conditions required hereunder
so  as not to interfere unreasonably with any operations at the  Assessed
Real Property or to damage the Assessed Real Property  or any improvements
thereon, except for collateral damage  resulting from such Remediation, which
collateral damage shall  be repaired by or at the direction of the Company 
Shareholders. Buyer shall allow the Company Shareholders and  the
Environmental Consultant access to the Assessed Real  Property, at all

Company  Shareholders or the Environmental Consultant onto the Assessed 
Real Property for such Remediation. The Company Shareholders  shall provide
Buyer with copies of all non-privileged  correspondence, reports and other
communications prepared or  received by    49     them or the
Environmental Consultant in connection with the  Remediation of the
Remediable Conditions.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement:   (i)

below)  solely to the extent required by, and in accordance  with, the
applicable Environmental Laws, including,  all applicable orders, directives,
policies and  requirements of courts or of relevant governmental  agencies
or other authorities. Completion of any  Remediation required hereunder shall
be evidenced by  issuance of a Closure Determination pursuant to  Section
5.14(g) hereof. For purposes of this Section  5.14, the term "Remediate" may
include reliance on  institutional or engineering controls or deed 
instruments required by governmental authorities  exercising jurisdiction
under applicable  Environmental Laws if such controls or instruments do  not
prevent or materially interfere with or restrict  the use of the properties
for purposes consistent  with their uses as of the Closing Date.   (ii)
"ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION" shall mean any recognized  environmental condition
(as defined by reference to  ASTM standard E 1527-97 or E 1527-2000),
violation of  law or regulation, or other matter with respect to  which
action or response is recommended or required  by the Environmental
Consultant, as identified or  addressed in the approved Phase I and Phase
II  environmental site assessments under Section 5.14(c)  above, or any
other matter with respect to which the  parties hereto agree that Remediation
shall be  conducted and shall include the full extent of such  environmental
conditions, violations or other matters  whether the same are fully known,
described or  characterized in said Phase I and Phase II  environmental
assessments.   (g) For purposes of this Section 5.14, any Remediation
required  hereunder with respect to any Environmental Condition shall be 
completed when the Shareholder Representative provides to  Buyer either (i) a
written no-action or no-further-action  letter or other form of closure
determination in the form and  scope customarily available from the primary
governmental  authority exercising jurisdiction over such Environmental 
Condition certifying that said Remediation is complete and no  further
Remediation is required, or (ii) if such a  determination from such
governmental authorities cannot  practicably be obtained, a written
certification from the  Environmental Consultant that, in its professional
opinion,  such Remediation was undertaken and completed in accordance  with
applicable laws and regulations and the Remediation Scope  of Work, and that,
in its professional opinion, the property  involved is free from   
50     all previously identified Environmental Conditions. Such a 
written determination or certification issued pursuant to  clause (i) or (ii)
of this Section 5.14(g) shall be referred  to as a "CLOSURE DETERMINATION"
for purposes of this  Agreement.  5.15 EXCLUDED LAND.   Buyer agrees

substantially in the form set forth in EXHIBIT J-6.  5.16 FARM PERMITS AND
CONSENTS.   (a) The Company and Buyer shall jointly notify, promptly after
the  date hereof, the applicable governmental authorities that  issued the
consents, licenses, permits, authorizations or  approvals identified in
SCHEDULE 5.16(a) attached hereto (the  "SCHEDULED FARM CONSENTS") applicable
to those turkey  production farms set forth in SCHEDULE 5.16(b) attached
hereto  (the "SCHEDULED FARMS" and each, a "SCHEDULED FARM") of the 
execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby. If any
of such governmental authorities does not issue  any such Scheduled Farm
Consents, or asserts that other or  different consents, approvals, permits or
licenses are  required or must be issued or renewed with respect to the 
Scheduled Farms (together with the Scheduled Farm Consents,  the "FARM
CONSENTS") due to any of the circumstances set forth  in the next sentence of
this Section 5.16(a), then the Company  Shareholders shall (i) in the first
instance and at their sole  cost and expense, with the assistance,
cooperation and best  efforts of Buyer (so long as such efforts are at the
Company  Shareholders\' expense), take such actions as are necessary to 
cause the Farm Consents to be issued prior to the Effective  Time and (ii) if
Section 5.16(b) hereof is applicable and is  elected by the Company
Shareholders after their compliance  with the preceding clause (i), replace
the turkey production  of the affected Scheduled Farms in effect as of the
Effective  Time in accordance with the terms of Section 5.16(b) hereof.  The
obligations of the Company Shareholders under the previous  sentence of this
Section 5.16(a) shall be applicable only in  the event of (x) any failure of
the Company    51    or Company Shareholders to undertake, complete or
properly  perform any action legally required to be taken prior to the 
Effective Time; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that the execution and  delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby, in
and of themselves, shall  not be deemed to be a failure of the Company or
Company  Shareholders to undertake, complete or properly perform any  action
legally required to be taken it or them, (y) the  Company\'s violation of a
statute, rule, regulation or other  legal requirement prior to the Effective
Time; PROVIDED  HOWEVER, that the execution and delivery of this Agreement 
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,  in and of
themselves, shall not be deemed to be a violation of  a statute, rule,
regulation or other legal requirement, or (z)  any other action or inaction
of the Company or Company  Shareholders prior to the Effective Time not
related to  execution and delivery of this Agreement.   (b) If the Company
Shareholders\' obligation to obtain Farm  Consents applicable to a Scheduled
Farm applies pursuant to  Section 5.16(a) hereof, and any such Farm Consents
are not  obtained prior to the Effective Time, then the Company 
Shareholders may replace the turkey production generated at  such Scheduled
Farm as of the Effective Time in accordance  with the terms set forth below
in this Section 5.16(b).   (i) Each Scheduled Farm subject to a Farm Consent
that  has not been obtained as of the Closing Date (each, a  "TRANSFERRED
FACILITY") shall be conveyed by the  Company prior to the Effective Time to
Our Family,  LLP or Our Family MN, LLP, as designated in writing  by the
Shareholders Representative, at a cost equal  to the appraised value of such
Transferred Facility  plus the "Allocated Goodwill" (as defined below) for 
such Transferred Facility; PROVIDED that, the Company  Shareholders shall pay
all costs and expenses  associated with such conveyance, including, without 
limitation, costs of appraisal, transfer taxes, real  estate fees, recording,
title evidence and insurance,  if any (collectively, the "CONVEYANCE COSTS").
For  purposes of this Agreement, "ALLOCATED GOODWILL"  shall mean the
product of (A) the aggregate goodwill  to be recognized by Buyer on its books
and records  resulting from the Merger multiplied by (B) the  quotient
resulting from dividing (X) the book value  of a Transferred Facility, as set
forth in the  financial books and records of the Company as of the  Closing
Date, by (Y) the book value of all of the  Company\'s assets (after giving
effect to the  Disposition) as set forth in such records as of the  Closing
Date;   (ii) Our Family, LLP or Our Family MN, LLP, as applicable,  shall
thereafter (A) cause the Transferred Facility  to be subject to a turkey
production contract or  lease, at Buyer\'s option, for a period of at least 
five (5) years, or (B) replace the turkey  production represented by the
Transferred Facility  with alternative turkey production reasonably 
acceptable to Buyer for a period of at least five (5)  years; PROVIDED that,
in all instances, the  replacement turkey production to be provided
under    52    either clause (A) or (B) of this Section 5.16(b)(ii) 
shall be equivalent, both in quantity and quality, to  the turkey production
of the Transferred Facility,  and such replacement turkey production shall be
made  available to Buyer at the cost of production incurred  by Our Family,
LLP or Our Family MN, LLP, as  applicable, without any profit margin, mark-up
or  other addition by Our Family, LLP or Our Family MN,  LLP, as applicable.
For purposes of this Section  5.16(b)(ii), the cost of such turkey production
shall  be deemed to be equal to the costs projected in the  Long-Range Plan,
EXCEPT that the cost of feed and  fuel used by Our Family, LLP or Our Family
MN, LLP,  as applicable, in the production of turkeys for  replacement
purposes, shall be equal to the actual  costs thereof to such producers in
effect from time  to time during the term of such replacement  production
(which costs shall be documented by such  producers and available for audit
by Buyer from time  to time). The terms and conditions of such  replacement
production shall be those set forth in  the standard form of independent
grower contract  utilized by Jennie-O Foods, Inc. from time to time.  If
Buyer chooses to lease a Transferred Facility from  Our Family, LLP or Our
Family MN, LLP, such lease  terms shall be negotiated in good faith by the 
parties, but the total rent payable by Buyer  thereunder shall be equal to no
more than, in each  case with respect to the Transferred Facility, the 
actual real property taxes payable by the owner  thereof, insurance,
utilities, assessments, scheduled  depreciation for assets owned by the
lessor,  financing costs of leasehold improvements paid for by  the lessor
and the costs of any improvements  requested by Buyer. If, during the term of
a  production contract or lease, the applicable Farm  Consent or Consents
were to be issued with respect to  a Transferred Facility, then such
Transferred  Facility shall be conveyed back to the Company (or  its
successors or assigns) at the same price  provided for in Section 5.16(b)(i)
above under the  same terms and conditions of this Agreement as if  such
property had been included as an asset of the  Company on the Effective Date;
PROVIDED that, the  Company Shareholders shall pay all associated 
Conveyance Costs, except the costs of any premiums  under any title
insurance, which shall be paid by  Buyer. If, upon expiration of the term of
a  production contract or lease, the applicable Farm  Consent or Farm
Consents were not issued, then, at  Buyer\'s option, (x) the parties may
renew the  production contract or lease on the same terms and  conditions
and for another term equal in length to  the initial term or (y) the Company
(or its  successors or assigns) shall be entitled to a thirty  (30) day
option to purchase the Transferred Facility  without having the applicable
Farm Consents in hand,  at a price equal to the then-appraised market value 
of such Transferred Facility plus the Allocated  Goodwill applicable to such
Transferred Facility or  (z) the production represented by the Transferred 
Facility may be replaced with alternative turkey  production    53   
on terms and conditions (including quality and  quantity of production)
reasonably acceptable to  Buyer.   (c) If a Farm Consent were not to be
issued due to any reason  other than that set forth in the last sentence of
Section  5.16(a) hereof, then the Company Shareholders shall have no 
further obligation to obtain such Scheduled Farm Consent;  EXCEPT that, if
Buyer were to choose, in its sole discretion,  to pursue either obtaining
such Scheduled Farm Consent or  contesting the applicable governmental
authority\'s failure or  refusal to issue such Scheduled Farm Consent
(collectively, a  "CONTEST"), then the Company Shareholders, on the one
hand,  and Buyer, on the other, shall share equally in the legal  costs,
including attorneys\' fees, costs and expert witnesses  or consultant fees,
incurred in such Contest. If such Contest  were to involve the action or
inaction of any governmental  authority in Wisconsin, the parties agree to
retain Michael  Best and Friedrich LLP for such contest; if such Contest were
to  involve the action or inaction of any governmental authority  in
Minnesota or the federal government, the parties agree to  retain Dorsey and
Whitney LLP for such Contest. If the parties  were to prevail in any such
legal contest, then the Scheduled  Farm that is the subject of such Contest
would then be  transferred to Buyer at the price set forth in Section 
5.16(b)(i) hereof (assuming that such Scheduled Farm had  become a
Transferred Facility prior to the conclusion of such  legal contest); and, if
the parties were not to prevail in any  such Contest, such that the Farm
Consent involved were still  held to be required by the applicable
governmental  authorities, then the parties agree that terms and conditions 
of Section 5.16(b) hereof shall apply.   (d) This Section 5.16 applies only
to Farm Consents that are  applicable to the Scheduled Farms.    ARTICLE

disagreement within ten (10) business days, the  Chief Financial Officer of
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative  shall agree to retain the

which decision shall be final and binding;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Expert, promptly upon its engagement, shall  disclose any business
relationship it currently has, or has in the past  three (3) years had, with
Buyer or Seller or any of their respective  affiliates and the party with
whom the Expert does not have a  relationship shall be entitled to propose a
different, independent  nationally recognized accounting firm to act as
Expert, which firm  shall be subject to the review and approval, not to be
unreasonably  withheld, of the other party. Such proposed Expert shall
disclose any  business relationship it currently has, or has in the past
three (3)  years had, with Buyer or Seller and shall be subject to
replacement in  accordance with the proviso of the preceding sentence. The
Expert shall  conduct such arbitration by reviewing the Closing Balance Sheet
with  the understanding that such Closing    63    Balance Sheet was to
be prepared in a manner consistent with the  accounting principles identified
in Section 9.01 hereof. The party  whose determination of Closing Date
Working Capital is furthest from  the amount determined by the Expert shall
bear its own costs and  expenses, the fees and expenses of the Expert and the
out-of-pocket  costs and expenses (including legal fees and costs) of the
other party  thereto.  9.03 ADJUSTMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.   Subject
to Section 9.04 hereof,   (a) In the event that the Closing Date Working
Capital is less  than $26,379,000 (the "TARGET WORKING CAPITAL"), the
Escrow  Agent shall deliver to Buyer the amount of such shortfall from  the
Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, and if such  shortfall exceeds the
Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount,  the Shareholder Representative shall
cause the Company  Shareholders (other than the ESOP) to deliver to Buyer,
within  five (5) business days after the later of the delivery of the 
Closing Balance Sheet or final resolution of any dispute  regarding the
Closing Date Working Capital as provided in  Section 9.02 hereof, cash in an
amount equal to the amount by  which such shortfall exceeds the Post-Closing
Adjustment  Escrow Amount. If such shortfall is less than the Post-Closing 
Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to  the Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company  Shareholders other than the ESOP,
and to the ESOP, the amount  of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount
remaining after  it has delivered to Buyer the amount of such shortfall
from  the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount. Such remaining  amount of
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be  apportioned between the
Shareholder Representative and the  ESOP as follows: (i) to the Shareholder
Representative, a  percentage of such amount equal to the percentage of
Company  capital stock held by all Company Shareholders other than the  ESOP
at the Effective Time (the "NON-ESOP SHAREHOLDERS  PERCENTAGE") and (ii) to
the ESOP, a percentage of such amount  equal to 100% minus the Non-ESOP
Shareholders Percentage (the  "ESOP SHAREHOLDERS PERCENTAGE").   (b) In the
event that the Closing Date Working Capital is greater  than the Target
Working Capital, Buyer shall deliver to the  Company Shareholders, within
five (5) business days after the  later of the delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet or final  resolution of any dispute regarding the Closing Date
Working  Capital as provided in Section 9.02 hereof, cash in an amount 
equal to the amount by which the Closing Date Working Capital  exceeds the
Target Working Capital and the Escrow Agent shall  deliver to the Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the  Company Shareholders, other than the ESOP
the Non-ESOP  Shareholders Percentage and to the ESOP, the ESOP
Shareholders  Percentage of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount.   
64   9.04 DEFINITION OF WORKING CAPITAL; ESTIMATE.   For the purposes of
this Agreement, "CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL"  shall mean, with respect to
the Business as of the close of business on  the Closing Date (after giving

applied on a  basis consistent with the preparation of the Pro Forma Latest
Balance  Sheet; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, with respect to the calculation of 
Closing Date Working Capital (i) any liability related to deferred 
compensation shall be treated as a long-term liability in such  calculation

in the Company Financial Statements and (ii)  such calculation shall exclude
the effect of any reclassification of  any deferred compensation as a current

exceed the Target  Working Capital by approximately $20.0 million.
Accordingly, (i) Buyer  has agreed that, on the Closing Date, it will pay
such amount to the  Company Shareholders in accordance with Sections 2.01 and
2.03 hereof  as though such amount were Merger Consideration and (ii) Buyer

the  Company Shareholders (collectively the "SHAREHOLDER  INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") and hold them harmless against any  Losses which the Shareholder
Indemnified Parties may suffer,  sustain or become subject to, prior to the
second anniversary  of the Effective Date, as a result of (i) any 
misrepresentation of any of the representations and warranties  of Buyer or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any  exhibits, schedules or
certificates delivered or to be  delivered by or on behalf of Buyer or Merger
Sub pursuant to  the terms of this Agreement or in any other documents 
described in Article VII hereof that are to be so delivered  (collectively,
the "BUYER RELATED DOCUMENTS") or (ii) any  breach of, or failure to perform,
any agreement of Buyer or  Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or any of
the Buyer  Related Documents.   (c) Each of the Company Shareholders and

Losses (a "LOSS PAYMENT"), such Company Shareholder shall  have no rights
against the Surviving Corporation, or any  director, officer or employee
thereof (in their capacity as  such), whether by reason of contribution,
indemnification,  subrogation or otherwise, in respect of any such Loss
Payment,  and shall not take any action against the Surviving  Corporation
or any such person with respect thereto. Any  rights with respect to Loss
Payments which any of the Company  Shareholders or the Shareholder
Representative may, by  operation or law or otherwise, have against the
Surviving  Corporation or any such person shall, effective at the time of 
the Closing, be deemed to be hereby expressly and knowingly  waived.   
69   11.03 METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS.   As used herein, "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY" shall refer either to a Buyer  Indemnified Party or a Shareholder
Indemnified Party, as applicable,  and "INDEMNIFYING PARTY" shall refer to
the party obligated hereunder  to indemnify such Indemnified Party.   (a)
In the event that any of the Indemnified Parties is made a  defendant in or
party to any action or proceeding, judicial or  administrative, instituted by
any third party for liability,  costs or expenses of which are Losses (any
such third party  action or proceeding being referred to as a "THIRD PARTY 
CLAIM"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying  Party prompt
notice thereof (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM NOTICE"),  including, in reasonable
detail, the identity of the third  party and the nature and amount of the
Third Party Claim,  which notice shall be delivered promptly to the
Indemnifying  Party. The failure to give such notice shall not affect any 
Indemnified Party\'s ability to seek reimbursement unless such  failure has
materially and adversely affected the Indemnifying  Party\'s ability to
defend successfully a Third Party Claim.  The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to contest and defend  such Third Party Claim; PROVIDED, that the
Indemnifying Party  diligently contests and defends such Third Party Claim.
Notice  of the intention so to contest and defend shall be given by  the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 20  business days after
the Indemnified Party\'s Third Party Claim  Notice (but, in all events, at
least five business days prior  to the date that an answer to such Third
Party Claim is due to  be filed). Such contest and defense shall be conducted
by  reputable attorneys employed by the Indemnifying Party. The  Indemnified
Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own  cost and expense (which
expense shall not constitute a Loss  unless the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that the  Indemnifying Party is not adequately representing or,
because  of a conflict of interest, may not adequately represent, any 
interests of the Indemnified Parties, and only to the extent  that such
expenses are reasonable), to participate in such  contest and defense and to
be represented by attorneys of its  or their own choosing. If the Indemnified
Party elects to  participate in such defense, the Indemnified Party will 
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such  defense.
Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying  Party may concede, settle
or compromise any Third Party Claim  without the consent of the other party,
which consent will not  be unreasonably withheld; provided that, if a Third
Party  Claim seeks monetary damages as its sole relief, the  Indemnifying
Party will be responsible for payment of 100% of  the final damage amount,
and the concession, settlement or  compromise includes a complete release of
the Indemnified  Parties with respect to the manners underlying such Third 
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party may concede, settle  or compromise
such Third Party Claim without the consent of  the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a  Third Party Claim seeks equitable
relief or (ii) if the  subject matter of a Third Party Claim relates to the
ongoing  business of any of the Indemnified Parties, which Third Party   
70    Claim, if decided against any of the Indemnified Parties,  would
materially adversely affect the ongoing business or  reputation of any of the
Indemnified Parties, then, in each  such case, the Indemnified Parties alone
shall be entitled to  contest, defend and settle such Third Party Claim in
the first  instance and, if the Indemnified Parties do not contest,  defend
or settle such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying  Party shall then have the
right to contest and defend (but not  settle) such Third Party Claim.   (b)
In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against  the
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party  Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice of such  claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party,  which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the  identity, nature and amount of Losses related to such
claim.  If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that  the
Indemnifying Party does not dispute the claim described in  such notice or
fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 20  days after delivery of such
notice by the Indemnified Party  whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the
claim described in  such notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the
notice  will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying  Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such  Loss to the
Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying  Party has timely disputed
its liability with respect to such  claim, the Shareholder Representative,
the trustee of the ESOP  (to the extent such liability is capable of being
satisfied  from the Escrow Amount) and the Chief Financial Officer of  Buyer
will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of  such dispute, and if
not resolved through such negotiations  within 60 days after the delivery of
the Indemnifying Party\'s  notice, such dispute shall be resolved fully and
finally in  Minneapolis, Minnesota by an arbitrator selected pursuant to, 
and an arbitration governed by, the Commercial Arbitration  Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator  shall resolve the dispute
within 30 days after selection and  judgment upon the award rendered by such
arbitrator may be  entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
party  whose position in the dispute (at the time the dispute was  submitted
to arbitration) is furthest from the resolution of  the dispute rendered by
the arbitrator shall pay all costs and  expenses of the other party in
connection with the arbitration  and the costs and the costs and expenses of
the arbitrator.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall not be deemed to have
notice  of any claim or of any breach by the Company of any  representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this  Agreement by virtue of knowledge
acquired on or prior to the  date of the Closing by an employee of the
Company or any  Subsidiary.   (d) Any notice required to be delivered to
the Company  Shareholders pursuant to this Article XI shall be deemed to 
have been duly delivered to the Company Shareholders if  delivered to the
Shareholder Representative and (to the extent    71    such liability is
capable of being satisfied from the Escrow  Amount) the trustee for the
ESOP.   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
(except as otherwise provided in Section 11.06 hereof), the  ESOP shall not
be obligated to pay any amounts pursuant to  this Article XI in excess of the
amounts held in the Escrow  Account (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement).  11.04 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITY.   (a) The Company
Shareholders shall be liable for claims under  Sections 11.02(a)(i) and
11.02(a)(iii) hereof only if the  aggregate amount of all Losses for claims
under Sections  11.02(a)(i) and 11.02(a)(iii) hereof exceeds $750,000 (the 
"BASKET AMOUNT"). The Basket Amount shall not apply to claims  other than
claims under Sections 11.02(a)(i) and 11.02(a)(iii)  hereof. In the event
that Losses for claims under Sections  11.02(a)(i) and 11.02(a)(iii) hereof
exceed the Basket Amount  or in the event of Losses for claims other than
claims under  Sections 11.02(a)(i) and 11.02(a)(iii) hereof, the Company 
Shareholders shall be obligated, jointly and severally, with  each other to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties for the  entire amount of all such Losses
without deduction up to the  total of the Cap Amount in effect at the time
that a notice of  a claim for Losses is made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
joint  and several obligation of the ESOP with the other Company 
Shareholders shall be limited to the Escrow Amount (except as  otherwise
provided in Section 11.06 hereof). The "CAP AMOUNT"  shall be equal to:  
(i) for the period from the Effective Date through the  date that is six (6)
months after the Effective Date  (the "INITIAL CAP PERIOD"), $100
million,   (ii) for the six-month period commencing upon expiration  of the
Initial Cap Period and ending on the date that  is six (6) months after such
expiration (the "SECOND  CAP PERIOD"), an amount equal to $66 million less
(x)  the aggregate amount of Losses in excess of $34  million for which the
Company Shareholders were  obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties  for claims subject to the Cap Amount made during the  Initial Cap
Period plus (y) the aggregate amount of  (I) all claims subject to the Cap
Amount for Losses  up to $34 million pending upon expiration of the  Initial
Cap Period less (II) the aggregate amount of  Losses for which the Company
Shareholders were  obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties  for
claims subject to the Cap Amount made during the  Initial Cap Period, and  
(iii) after expiration of the Second Cap Period, an amount  equal to $33.75
million less (x) the aggregate amount  of Losses in excess of $66.25 million
for which the  Company Shareholders were obligated to   72    
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for claims  subject to the Cap Amount
made during the Initial  Cap Period and the Second Cap Period plus (y) the 
aggregate amount of (I) all claims subject to the Cap  Amount for Losses up
to $66.25 million pending upon  expiration of the Second Cap Period less (II)
the  aggregate amount of Losses for which the Company  Shareholders were
obligated to indemnify the Buyer  Indemnified Parties for claims subject to
the Cap  Amount made during the Initial Cap Period or the  Second Cap
Period.   Except as otherwise set forth in the next two sentences, the  Cap
Amount shall be the maximum aggregate liability of the  Company Shareholders
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under  Section 11.02(a) hereof; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this 
Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of the ESOP to the  Buyer
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement shall not  exceed the Escrow Amount
and such liability shall be satisfied  only from funds held in the Escrow
Account (as defined in the  Escrow Agreement (and neither the Shareholder
Representative  nor the Company Shareholders shall in any event have any
right  to contribution or otherwise against the ESOP). The  limitations on
the indemnity obligations of the Company  Shareholders set forth in this
Section 11.04(a) shall not  apply to (i) claims for indemnification under
Section  11.02(a)(i) hereof for breaches of the representations set  forth
in Sections 3.01 (Incorporation and Corporate Power),  3.02 (Execution,
Delivery, Valid and Binding Agreement), 3.03  (Approval of the Merger
Agreement, Meeting of Shareholders),  3.06 (Capital Stock) and 3.16 (Tax
Matters) hereof, (ii)  claims for indemnification under Sections
11.02(a)(iv),  11.02(a)(v), 11.02(a)(vi), 11.02(a)(vii), 11.02(a)(viii) or 
11.02(a)(ix) hereof or (iii) claims for indemnification based  upon
allegations of fraud or other intentional breach of an  obligation of or with
respect to the other parties in  connection with this Agreement. The maximum
aggregate  liability of the Company Shareholders to Buyer in connection 
with complying with the covenants contained in Section 5.14(d)  hereof,
except for the Company Shareholders\' obligations in  respect of collateral
damage thereunder, shall not exceed $2.0  million, not including the costs of
conducting Phase I or  Phase II assessments which shall be an expense of
Buyer.   (b) The Company Shareholders shall be entitled to offset against 
their indemnification obligations under Section 11.02 hereof  for any Loss
the amount of any reserve that was established in  the Closing Balance Sheet
specifically for claims giving rise  to such Loss. This right of offset may
be exercised by the  Company Shareholders in their sole discretion by
delivering a  notice to Buyer thereof and following Buyer\'s and the 
Shareholder Representative\'s (i) acknowledgment that such a  reserve applies
to such Loss and (ii) agreement upon the  amount of such reserve available
for such purpose.   (c) Buyer and Merger Sub shall be liable for claims
under Section  11.02(b)(i) hereof only if the aggregate amount of all
Losses  for claims under Section   73     11.02(b)(i) hereof exceeds
the Basket Amount. The Basket  Amount shall not apply to claims against Buyer
or Merger Sub  other than claims under Section 11.02(b)(i) hereof. In the 
event that Losses for claims under Section 11.02(b)(i) hereof  exceed the
Basket Amount or in the event of Losses for claims  other than claims under
Section 11.02(b)(i) hereof, Buyer and  Merger Sub shall be obligated, jointly
and severally, to  indemnify the Shareholder Indemnified Parties for the
entire  amount of all such Losses without deduction up to a total of  the
Cap Amount in effect at the time the Claim for Losses is  made. Except as
otherwise set forth in the next sentence, the  Cap Amount shall be the
maximum aggregate liability of Buyer  and Merger Sub to the Shareholder
Indemnified Parties under  Section 11.02(b) hereof. The limitations on the
indemnity  obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub set forth in this  Section
11.04(c) shall not apply to (i) claims for  indemnification under Section
11.02(b)(i) hereof for breaches  of the representations set forth in Sections
4.01  (Incorporation and Corporate Power) and 4.02 (Execution,  Delivery,
Valid and Binding Agreement) hereof or (ii) claims  for indemnification based
upon allegations of fraud or other  intentional breach of an obligation of or
with respect to the  other parties in connection with this Agreement.   (d)
In computing the amount of indemnifiable Losses, there shall  be deducted
therefrom an amount equal to the amount of  insurance proceeds, if any, which
an Indemnified Party or any  of its affiliates actually receives as a
consequence of any  loss, claim, damage, liability, cost, expense or
deficiency  giving rise to such Losses.   (e) In computing the amount of
indemnifiable Losses, there shall  be (i) deducted therefrom an amount equal
to the amount of any  Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party  attributable to the loss, claim, damage, liability, cost,  expense or
deficiency giving rise to such Losses and (ii)  added thereto an amount equal
to any increased tax liability  of the Indemnified Party as a result of
inclusion in income of  any part of payments made in respect of such Losses.
If and to  the extent an Indemnified Party has not actually realized such 
Tax benefit at the time the Indemnifying Party makes an  indemnity payment,
the Indemnified Party shall make a payment  (or, as appropriate, payments) at
such time as it actually  realizes such Tax benefits. For purposes of
determining the  amount of any Tax benefit or detriment pursuant to this 
Section 11.04(e) hereof, the marginal combined federal and  state income tax
rate of the Indemnified Party shall be deemed  to be forty percent
(40%).  11.05 ESCROW AMOUNT.   (a) The Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be held by the  Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account pursuant to
the terms of  the Escrow Agreement from the Effective Date until the final 
resolution of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration is  determined under
Section 9.03 hereof and shall be   74     released by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with Section 9.03  hereof and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.   (b) The Environmental Remediation Escrow Amount shall be held
by  the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms  of the
Escrow Agreement from the Effective Date until the  expiration of the
Environmental Remediation Escrow Period (as  defined in the Escrow Agreement)
and shall be released by the  Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow  Agreement.   (c) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be
held by the Escrow  Agent in the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of
the  Escrow Agreement from the Effective Date until two years after  the
Effective Date (the "INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW PERIOD").  During the
Indemnification Escrow Period, if any Buyer  Indemnified Party suffers Losses
subject to indemnification  pursuant to Section 11.02(a) hereof, it shall be
entitled to  recover from the Indemnification Escrow Amount an amount equal 
to the amount of the Loss pursuant to the terms of the Escrow  Agreement.  
(d) At the end of the Indemnification Escrow Period, the Escrow  Agent shall
promptly deliver to the Shareholder Representative  and the ESOP cash (the
"RETURNED CASH") in amount equal to the  then current balance of
Indemnification Escrow Amount (subject  to the prior reduction of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount  through the release of funds in the Escrow
Fund in  satisfaction of any Loss for which Buyer Indemnified Parties  were
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(a)  hereof) less the
aggregate value of all pending claims for  indemnification under this Article
XI made by Buyer, if any,  for which notice has been timely filed by any
Buyer  Indemnified Party, and the Shareholder Representative shall in  turn
promptly deliver such cash to the Company Shareholders  (other than the ESOP)
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Returned Cash shall be
apportioned between the Shareholder  Representative and the ESOP as follows:
(i) to the Shareholder  Representative, a percentage of such Returned Cash
equal to  the Non-ESOP Shareholders Percentage and (ii) to the ESOP, a 
percentage of such Returned Cash equal to the ESOP  Shareholders Percentage.
At the time that the Escrow Agent  delivers the Returned Cash to the
Shareholder Representative  and the ESOP, the Escrow Agent shall deliver a
notice to  Buyer, the Shareholder Representative and the ESOP setting  forth
the amount of Returned Cash, the aggregate value of all  pending claims for
indemnification under this Article XI, if  any, for which notice has been
timely filed by any Buyer  Indemnified Party, and the amount of the
Indemnification  Escrow Amount that will remain in escrow pursuant to the 
Escrow Agreement pending resolution of any such claims (the  "RETAINED
CASH").   (e) Within ten (10) business days after the date on which a
claim  for indemnification of a Loss against Retained Cash has been 
completely and finally resolved in accordance with this  Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall   75     deliver to the Shareholder Representative
and the ESOP the  Retained Cash less an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate  amount recovered by Buyer in connection with the final 
resolution of its claims against the Retained Cash.   (f) Prior to release
from the Escrow Account, all income  earned on the Escrow Amount shall be
taxable to Buyer as the  owner thereof and shall be credited to the Escrow
Account. On  a quarterly basis, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, 
the Escrow Agent shall disburse forty percent (40%) of the  accumulated
income in the Escrow Account, including investment  income thereon, to Buyer
and the remainder of any accumulated  income shall remain in the Escrow
Account until released in  accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.  11.06 EXCLUSIVITY.   After the Closing, the rights set forth
in this Article XI shall be  each party\'s sole and exclusive remedies
against the other parties  hereto for misrepresentations or breaches of
covenants contained in  this Agreement and the Related Documents.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the
parties hereto from  bringing an action based upon allegations of fraud or
other intentional  breach of an obligation of or with respect to the other
parties in  connection with this Agreement and the Related Documents. In the
event  such action is brought, the prevailing party\'s attorneys\' fees and 
costs shall be paid by the nonprevailing party.  11.07 MERGER CONSIDERATION
ADJUSTMENT.   Any indemnification payable under this Article XI shall be, to
the  extent permitted by law, an adjustment to the Merger Consideration. 
Buyer shall not be entitled to recover Losses with respect to any  matter
(including any breach of this Agreement by the Company  Shareholders)
relating to the Closing Date Working Capital to the  extent such matter was
expressly included in the Closing Date Balance  Sheet and the calculation of
Closing Date Working Capital and factored  into the determination of any
adjustment to the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Article IX
hereof.  11.08 INSURANCE.   The Company Shareholders shall maintain in
full force and effect during  the Indemnification Escrow Period, the
insurance policies supporting  the Company Shareholders\' indemnification
obligations with respect to  the representations and warranties contained in
Article III of this  Agreement in the form delivered to Buyer on the Closing
Date.    76     ARTICLE XII  THE SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE AND ESOP
TRUSTEE   12.01 APPOINTMENT.   As used in this Agreement, the
"SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE" shall mean  Jerome K. Jerome, or any person
appointed as a successor Shareholders\'  Representative pursuant to Section
12.02 hereof.  12.02 ELECTION AND REPLACEMENT.   During the period ending
upon the date when all obligations under this  Agreement have been discharged
(including all indemnification  obligations under Article XI and the
Indemnification Agreement), the  Company Shareholders, other than the ESOP,
who, immediately prior to  the Effective Time, held Company Common Stock
representing an aggregate  number of shares of Company Common Stock which
exceeded 50% of the  amount of such Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to  the Effective Time (a "MAJORITY"), may, from time to
time upon written  notice to the Shareholder Representative and Buyer, remove
the  Shareholder Representative or appoint a new Shareholder Representative 
to fill any vacancy created by the death, incapacitation, resignation  or
removal of the Shareholder Representative. Furthermore, if the  Shareholder
Representative dies, becomes incapacitated, resigns or is  removed by a
Majority, the Majority shall appoint a successor  Shareholder Representative
to fill the vacancy so created. If the  Majority is required to but has not
appointed a successor Shareholder  Representative within 15 business days
from a request by Buyer to  appoint a successor Shareholder Representative,
Buyer shall have the  right to appoint a Shareholder Representative to fill
any vacancy so  created, and shall advise all those who were holders of
Company Common  Stock, other than the ESOP, immediately prior to the
Effective Time of  such appointment by written notice. A copy of any
appointment by the  Majority of any successor Shareholder Representative
shall be provided  to Buyer promptly after it shall have been
effected.  12.03 AUTHORITY.   The Shareholder Representative shall be
authorized to take any action  and to make and deliver any certificate,
notice, consent or instrument  required or permitted to be made or delivered
under this Agreement or  under the documents referred to in this Agreement
(an "INSTRUMENT")  which the Shareholder Representative determines in his
discretion to be  necessary, appropriate or desirable, and, in connection
therewith, to  hire or retain, at the sole expense of the Company
Shareholders, other  than the ESOP, such counsel, investment bankers,
accountants,  representatives and other professional advisors as he
determines in his  sole and absolute discretion to be necessary, advisable or
appropriate  in order to carry out and perform his rights and obligations
hereunder.  Any party receiving an Instrument from the Shareholder
Representative  shall have the   77     right to rely in good faith
upon such certification, and  to act in accordance with the Instrument
without independent  investigation.  12.04 NO LIABILITY OF BUYER.   (a)
Buyer (and the Surviving Corporation) shall have no liability  to any Company
Shareholder, other than the ESOP, or otherwise  arising out of the acts or
omissions of the Shareholder  Representative or any disputes among the
Company Shareholders  or with the Shareholder Representative. Buyer shall
have no  direct liability to the Company Shareholders, other than the  ESOP,
under this Agreement or the other agreements referred to  herein and may rely
entirely on its dealings with, and notices  to and from, the Shareholder
Representative to satisfy any  obligations it might have under this
Agreement, any agreement  referred to herein or otherwise to the Company
Shareholders,  other than the ESOP.   (b) Buyer (and the Surviving
Corporation) shall have no liability  to any beneficiary of the ESOP, or
otherwise arising out of  the acts or omissions of the trustee of the ESOP or
any  disputes among such beneficiaries or with the trustee of the  ESOP.
Buyer shall have no direct liability to any beneficiary  of the ESOP, under
this Agreement or the other agreements  referred to herein and may rely
entirely on its dealings with,  and notices to and from, the trustee of the
ESOP to satisfy  any obligations it might have under this Agreement, any 
agreement referred to herein or otherwise to the ESOP.    ARTICLE XIII 
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS   The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between Buyer and the Company Shareholders for certain
Tax matters.  13.01 TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE OR INCLUDING THE
EFFECTIVE DATE.   Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and
filed) at its  own expense, on or prior to the due date, all Tax Returns for
the  Company and the Included Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or 
prior to or including the Effective Date where the due date for such  Tax
Returns falls after the Effective Date (all Tax Returns described  in this
Section 13.01 and any schedules to be included therewith shall  be prepared
on a basis consistent with those of the Company prepared  for prior Tax
periods); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Buyer nor the  Company shall file
any such Tax Returns, or other returns, elections,  claims for refund or
information statements with respect to any  liabilities for Taxes for any Tax
period, or consent to any adjustment  or otherwise compromise or settle any
matters with respect to Taxes,  without the prior approval of the Shareholder
Representative, which  approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and, in
addition to any  applicable requirements set forth in    78    
Section 11.03 hereof or herein, Buyer shall provide the Shareholder 
Representative with prompt notice of any inquiry, audit, or proceeding  with
respect to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on, prior to,  or
including the Closing Date and provide the Shareholder  Representative with
the right to participate with respect thereto.  Buyer shall provide (or cause
to be provided) the Shareholder  Representative with a copy of appropriate
workpapers, schedules,  drafts and final copies of each such Tax Return of
the Company or  Included Subsidiary at least ten days before filing such
return and  shall reasonably cooperate with any request by the Shareholder 
Representative in connection therewith.  13.02 REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS.  
Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Company and the  Included
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which  Buyer or the
Company and the Included Subsidiaries become entitled,  that relate to Tax
periods or portions thereof ending on or before or  including the Effective
Date shall be for the account of the Company  Shareholders, and Buyer shall
pay to the Shareholder Representative any  such refund or the amount of any
such credit with fifteen (15) days  after receipt or entitlement
thereto.  13.03 CERTAIN BUYER COVENANTS.   Without the prior written
consent of the Shareholder Representative  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), neither Buyer, the  Company, the Included
Subsidiaries nor any affiliate of Buyer shall (i)  make any election or (ii)
file any amended Tax Return with any Tax  authority with respect to any Tax
period ending on, before or including  the Effective Date that would have the
effect of creating or increasing  any indemnification obligations of the
Company Shareholders under  Section 11.02(a) hereof or under the
Indemnification Agreement. Buyer  shall not make an election under Section
338 of the Code with respect  to the Company.  13.04 COOPERATION ON TAX
MATTERS.   Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries and the Shareholder 
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably 
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax  Returns
pursuant to this Article XIII and any audit, litigation or  other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include  the retention and
(upon the other party\'s request) the provision of  records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such  audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on  a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and  explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Company and the  Subsidiaries agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to  Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Subsidiaries relating to  any Tax period beginning before the Effective Date
until the expiration  of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified  by Buyer or the Shareholder Representative, any extensions
thereof) of  the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record  
79     retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, and 
(ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to 
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and,  if
the other party so requests, the Company and the Subsidiaries or  the
Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the  other party
to take possession of such books and records.   13.05 ALLOCATION OF
TAXES.   For purposes of this Agreement, in determining, in the case of
any  Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax 
period that includes (but does not end on) the Effective Date, the  portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period  ending on the
Effective Date shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other  than Taxes based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be  the amount of such
Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a  fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period  ending on the Effective Date
and the denominator of which is the number  of days in the entire Tax period
and (b) in the case of any Tax based  upon or related to income or receipts
be deemed equal to the amount  which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the  Effective Date. Any credits relating to a Tax period
that begins before  and ends after the Effective Date shall be taken into
account as though  the relevant Tax period ended on the Effective Date. All
determinations  necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall
be made in  a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company and the
Included  Subsidiaries.    ARTICLE XIV  MISCELLANEOUS   14.01 PRESS
RELEASES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS.   Prior to the Effective Time, no party hereto
shall issue any press  release (or make any other public announcement)
related to this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or make
any  announcement to the employees, customers or suppliers of the Company
or  any Subsidiary without prior written approval of the other party hereto 
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that 
Buyer may issue any such release (or other announcement) as it  determines,
in its sole discretion, may be required to comply with the  requirements of
this Agreement, applicable law or by obligations  pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities  exchange. If Buyer determines that
any such press release or public  announcement is so required, Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts to  provide notice to, and to consult in good faith
with, the Company (but  shall not be required to obtain the consent of the
Company) prior to  issuing such press release or making such
announcement.    80    14.02 FURTHER ASSURANCES.   The Company
Shareholders agree that, on and after the Effective Date,  they will take all
appropriate action and execute any documents,  instruments or conveyances of
any kind which may be reasonably  necessary or advisable to carry out any of
the provisions hereof.  14.03 AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.   This Agreement may
not be amended or waived except in a writing  executed by the party against
which such amendment or waiver is sought  to be enforced; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that after the approval of the  Articles of Merger by the Company
Shareholders, no amendment may be  made which reduces the Merger
Consideration or which effects any  changes which would materially adversely
affect the Company  Shareholders without the further approval of the Company
Shareholders.  No course of dealing between or among any persons having any
interest  in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify or amend any
part  of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any person under or 
by reason of this Agreement.  14.04 NOTICES.   All notices, demands and
other communications to be given or delivered  under or by reason of the
provisions of this Agreement will be in  writing and will be deemed to have
