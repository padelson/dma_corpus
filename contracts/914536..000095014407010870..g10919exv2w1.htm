ARTICLE II  

   

 _Effects of the Merger; Consideration_  

   

 SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Company Securities_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, the Stockholders or the Option Holders, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, the Stockholders or the Option Holders, each share of capital stock of the Company that is owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by (i) the Company as treasury stock, (ii) Buyer, (iii) Merger Sub, (iv) any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer or (v) any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, the Stockholders or the Option Holders, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive from Buyer and the Surviving Corporation a sum in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, as finally determined after taking into account any adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.3, without any interest thereon, at the time and in the manner set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , that Buyer shall have the right to defer the payment of a portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such Share is converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) (such amount, the " _Per Share Deferred Amount_ "), provided that the Per Share Deferred Amount shall be payable on or before the Deferred Payment Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and subject to the provisions of Section 2.8. The right of any holder of any Share to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration into which his, her or its Shares are converted pursuant to this Section shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Laws. 

  

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b) and subject to Section 2.7, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, the Stockholders or the Option Holders, each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding 

   ##### 

  

 

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a sum in cash equal to the Series A Preferred Stock Redemption
Payment (other than Series A Preferred Stock held by dissenting stockholders
exercising rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL), without any
interest thereon, at the time and in the manner set forth in this Agreement.
The right of any holder of any share of Series A Preferred Stock to receive
the Series A Preferred Stock Redemption Payment into which his, her or its
shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted pursuant to this Section 2.1
(d) shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable tax Laws. 

   

 (e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, each share of Restricted Stock shall be canceled. Each holder of Restricted Stock that has vested as of the Effective Time shall be treated hereunder as a holder of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Restricted Stock that is not vested as of the Effective Time, or that does not vest at the Effective Time in accordance with the applicable subscription agreement, shall be forfeited and cancelled at the Effective Time without the payment of any consideration therefor. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, each Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall fully vest. Subject to Section 2.8, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, each Option Holder shall become entitled to receive from Buyer and the Surviving Corporation a sum in cash in respect of each of such Option Holders Options equal to the Option Cancellation Payment applicable to such Options, as finally determined after taking into account any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.3, without any interest thereon, at the time and in the manner set forth in this Agreement;  _provided_ , that Buyer shall have the right to defer the payment of a portion of the Option Cancellation Payment due to each Option Holder who has signed an Option Acknowledgement prior to the Closing (such amount, the " _Per Option Deferred Amount_ ") provided such Per Option Deferred Amount shall be payable on or before the Deferred Payment Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and subject to the provisions of Section 2.8. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall be net of all applicable withholding and excise taxes. As of the Effective Time, each stock option agreement entered into by the Company shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be cancelled. 

  

 (g) The Company shall prepare and deliver on or prior to the Closing Date an acknowledgment to be signed by each Option Holder, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ (each an " _Option Acknowledgment_ "), which (i) acknowledges that each of such Option Holders outstanding Options will be cancelled and surrendered at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive, in respect of each Option, the Option Cancellation Payment as finally determined after taking into account any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.3 and (ii) confirms the appointment of Stockholders Representative as his, her or its agent, pursuant to the terms of Section 9.1. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) After the Effective Time all capital stock of the Company, and any options relating thereto, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, or converted in accordance with this Section 2.1, as the case may be, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares or options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the consideration provided herein. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing. 

  

 (i) The Deferred Payment Amount shall be deducted at Closing from (i) the Option Cancellation Payments payable to Option Holders who have signed an Option Acknowledgement and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (other than the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to those dissenting stockholders exercising rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL who do not receive a cash payment in the Merger pursuant to this Article II), each in accordance with the Capital Structure Certificate. 

  

 (j) In calculating the consideration payable under this Section 2.1, Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the Capital Structure Certificate. If such representations and warranties and certificate are not correct, Buyer shall have the right (in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have pursuant to Article VIII) to adjust the Per Share Merger Consideration accordingly. 

  

 SECTION 2.2 _Estimated Adjustment Amount_. 

  

 (a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "). The Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and _Annex 1_ attached hereto, using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies as were used in the preparation of the Company Financials (to the extent such accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies are in conformity with GAAP), and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth on _Annex 1_. The Company shall provide Buyer and its Representatives access to review and make copies of all working papers, schedules, books and records and personnel and shall provide to Buyer information supporting such calculation of Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital in reasonable detail. If Buyer disputes the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital amount (or any portion thereof) at any time prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer and the Company will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute at or prior to the Closing Date. To the extent the Company and Buyer can not agree upon the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital prior to the Closing Date, then the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be deemed to be equal to the Target Net Working Capital. 

  

 (b) " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ " (positive or negative) means (i) the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital minus (ii) the amount of the Target Net Working Capital. For purposes of the Closing (and the payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.5 at the Closing), if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Enterprise Value will be increased by the Estimated Adjustment Amount, or if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Enterprise Value will be decreased by the absolute value of the Estimated Adjustment Amount. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.3 _Adjustment Amount_. 

  

 (a) Within 120 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Stockholders Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement prepared in accordance with this Section 2.3 (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth the calculation of Net Working Capital as derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and the Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and _Annex 1_ , using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies as were used in the preparation of the Company Financials (to the extent such accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies are in conformity with GAAP) and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth on _Annex 1_. 

  

 (b) Except for the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer and the Company agree that on the Closing Date the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be conducted in the ordinary course in a manner substantially consistent with past practice. Following the Closing, neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action with respect to the accounting books, records, policies or procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement is to be based that would affect the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Statement or would impede or delay the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital in the manner and utilizing the methods required by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made in any reserve or other account existing as of the date of the Company Financials other than in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether as a result of events occurring after the date of the Company Financials, as a result of new information discovered after the date of the Company Financials, or otherwise). 

  

 (c) Unless Stockholders Representative notifies Buyer in writing within 30 days after Buyers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement of any objection to the computation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital set forth therein (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement shall be final and binding for all purposes hereunder. During such 30-day period, Stockholders Representative and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including legal counsel and independent accountants) (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall be permitted to have access to, to review and to make copies of all relevant working papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Buyer and its Representatives relating to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein. To be effective, any such Notice of Objection shall include a copy of the Closing Date Statement setting forth Buyers 

   ##### 

  

 

determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital marked to indicate those
specific line items that are in dispute (the " _Disputed Items_ ") and shall
be accompanied by Stockholders Representatives calculation of each of the
Disputed Items and Stockholders Representatives revised Closing Date
Statement setting forth its determination of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital. To the extent Stockholders Representative provides a Notice
of Objection within such 30-day period, all items that are not Disputed Items
shall be final and binding for all purposes hereunder. In the event that
Stockholders Representative does not provide a Notice of Objection within
such 30-day period, Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted in full the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement, in
each case as prepared by Buyer, and the Closing Date Net Working Capital as
determined by Buyer, which shall be final and binding for all purposes
hereunder. If Stockholders Representative provides such Notice of Objection
to Buyer within such 30-day period, Buyer and Stockholders Representative
shall, during the 30-day period following Stockholders Representatives
delivery of such Notice of Objection to Buyer, attempt in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Items. During such 30-day period, Buyer and its
Representatives shall be permitted to have access to, review and make copies
of the working papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by
Stockholders Representative and Stockholders Representatives
Representatives relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor.
If Buyer and Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve all such
Disputed Items within such period, the matters remaining in dispute shall be
submitted to KPMG, LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to another
nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer
and Stockholders Representative) (such accounting firm being referred to
herein as the " _Independent Accountant_ "). The parties shall instruct the
Independent Accountant to render its decision within 30 days of its
selection. The Independent Accountant shall only resolve the Disputed Items
by choosing the amounts submitted by either Buyer or Stockholders
Representative or amounts in between. The Surviving Corporation and
Stockholders Representative shall each furnish to the Independent Accountant
such work papers and other documents and information relating to the Disputed
Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The resolution of the
Disputed Items by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding, and
the determination of the Independent Accountant shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may
be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The date on which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital is finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.3(c) is hereinafter referred as to the " _Determination
Date_." The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
allocated between Buyer and Stockholders Representative in the same
proportion that the total amount of the Disputed Items submitted to the
Independent Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount
of the Disputed Items so submitted by each such party. Buyer shall
be responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Section 2.3 (including the amount it is required to pay to the
Independent Accountant). The Stockholders Representative shall be
responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Section 2.3 (including any amount it is required to pay to the Independent
Accountant) (collectively, the " _Representative Section 2.3 Expenses_");
provided, however that it shall be entitled to eit her (a) instruct the
Paying Agent to pay or reimburse it for such Representative Section 2.3
Expenses from the Adjustment Amount, if any, payable by the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(d) or (b)
to the extent the amount so paid from the Adjustment Amount, if any, is
insufficient to enable the Stockholders Representative to be reimbursed for
all of the Representative Section 2.3 Expenses, the Stockholders
Representative may instruct the Paying Agent to pay the
Representative Section 2.3 Expenses from any Deferred Payment Amount received
by the Paying Agent for subsequent payment to the Stockholders and Option
Holders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) " _Adjustment Amount_ " (positive or negative) means (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c) minus (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, within three Business Days following the Determination Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account, in the name of the Paying Agent, designated in writing by Stockholders Representative, an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount. Upon receipt of the Adjustment Amount, Stockholders Representative shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse the amounts so received by it in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, within three Business Days following the Determination Date, the Stockholders Representative shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account, in the name of Buyer, designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount to the extent that (at the Stockholders Representatives direction) any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration or Option Cancellation Payment to be paid to Stockholders and Option Holders who have signed an Option Acknowledgement, respectively, has been retained by or on behalf of the Stockholders Representative for payment of any Adjustment Amount owed to the Buyer (the " _Adjustment Amount Retention_ "). Each of the Stockholders (other than those dissenting stockholders exercising rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL who do not receive a cash payment in the Merger pursuant to Article II) and Option Holders who have delivered an executed Option Acknowledgement agree to pay, jointly and severally, any Adjustment Amount payable to the Buyer hereunder. To the extent the Adjustment Amount owing to the Buyer, if any, is not received within thirty days following the Determination Date, the Buyer, at its election, may opt to reduce the Deferred Payment Amount dollar for dollar by any such Adjustment Amount not received in accordance with Section 2.8(b). The amount of any Adjustment Amount paid pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall be deemed an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for all purposes including for purposes of the final Per Share Merger Consideration and the final Option Cancellation Payment. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) No later than five Business Days prior to the date that the Closing is scheduled to occur, Buyer shall cause to be mailed, or otherwise made available, to each holder of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") formerly evidencing shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock a form of the Letter of Transmittal. After the Effective Time, each holder of Certificates, within one Business Day following the surrender of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with the completed Letter of Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange therefor, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, the aggregate consideration for such shares as the case may be, in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, and the Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. The Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and Buyer shall 

   ##### 

  

 

be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of such shares, as the case may be,
such amounts as the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Buyer is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Buyer, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such shares, as the case may be, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Buyer, as the case may be. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4 (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares (as defined below)), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the aggregate consideration for such shares, as the case may be,
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon. 

   

 (b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any such shares, as the case may be, that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company, subject to any applicable deductions or withholdings as described in Section 2.4(a) above, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an undertaking of indemnity (in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer) by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (c) At any time following the expiration of 24 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and such funds shall thereafter become the property of the Surviving Corporation. Such funds may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Corporation and shall be free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person. Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable consideration payable as contemplated by this Agreement (net of any amounts that would be subject to withholding) upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Any portion of such remaining cash unclaimed by Stockholders or Option Holders, as the case may be, as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfer in the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock or Options, as the case may be, that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.4. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but not later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make through its existing payroll service the Option Cancellation Payment less the Per Option Deferred Amount, as applicable, to each Option Holder entitled to receive the consideration specified in Section 2.1 in respect of their Options. The Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Option Holder such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Option Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 2.5 _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer will make (or cause to be made) the following payments, it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds delivered to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be):

 (v) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Stockholders Representative in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount in the aggregate equal to the Debt Repayment Expenses, which amount shall be distributed in accordance with the Debt Repayment Expense Annex (as defined below) as soon as practicable following the Closing; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Stockholders Representative in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount in the aggregate equal to the Defeasance Costs, which amount shall be distributed in accordance with the Defeasance Annex (as defined below) as soon as practicable following the Closing; 

   

 (vii) to an account designated by Stockholders Representative in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Adjustment Amount Retention; and 

   

 (viii) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the holders thereof in the applicable pay off letter referred to in Section 6.12, an amount equal to the amount due at Closing under the Closing Indebtedness as indicated in the applicable pay off letter for such Closing Indebtedness.

 (e) _Delivery of Payment Annexes and Capital Structure Certificate_. Each of the Closing Indebtedness Annex, the Debt Repayment Expenses Annex, the Transaction Expenses Annex and the Capital Structure Certificate shall be prepared by the Company in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and each shall be delivered to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.7 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by Stockholders who are entitled to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.1. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then: (i) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease; (ii) such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Series A Preferred Stock Redemption Payment, as the case may be, as specified in Section 2.1 (as adjusted, if applicable), without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.4, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares; (iii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Paying Agent funds for the benefit of such holder in an amount equal to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration (as adjusted, if applicable) less the Per Share Deferred Amount or (B) the Series A Preferred Stock Redemption Payment, as the case may be and (iv) the Deferred Payment Amount shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any such payment in accordance with this Section 2.7(b) and Section 2.8(b). 

  

 (c) The Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall give the Stockholders Representative prompt written notice (the " _Dissenters  Notice_") of any objections or demands (the " _Dissenters  Claims_") received by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock. The Stockholders Representative shall direct the negotiations and proceedings with respect to a Dissenters Claim; provided that the Stockholders Representative shall provide the Buyer with copies of all correspondence, pleadings and other documents relating to any Dissenters Claim and reasonable advance written notice of, and the opportunity to attend and participate in, any negotiations, calls, meetings, depositions, hearings or other proceedings relating thereto. The Stockholders Representative shall not effect any compromise or settlement with respect to any Dissenters Claim without the prior written consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Any and all amounts required to be paid on account of any Dissenters Claim shall be paid by a dollar for dollar reduction in the Deferred Payment Amount in accordance with Section 2.8(b) (the " _Dissenters  Rights Payments_"). 

  

 (d) Any and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in defending or otherwise resolving any Dissenters Claims (other than any Dissenters Rights Payments) shall be paid to the Stockholders Representative by the Paying Agent upon instructions from the Stockholders Representative to the Paying Agent from any Deferred Payment Amount received by the Paying Agent for subsequent payment to Stockholders and Option Holders in accordance with the terms hereof.

 SECTION 2.8 _Deferred Payment_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the payment of $20,000,000 of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been required to be paid at Closing to the Stockholders and Option Holders hereunder (the " _Deferred Payment Amount_ ") shall be deferred and shall be due and payable by the Buyer to the Paying Agent (for subsequent payment to the Stockholders and Option Holders in accordance herewith), by wire transfer to an account designated by the Paying Agent, no later than the date that is the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Deferred Payment Date_ "). All or any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount paid to the Paying Agent hereunder shall be paid together with interest thereon, which interest shall accrue at LIBOR plus 3% per annum, compounded quarterly, beginning on the day immediately following the Closing Date and continuing through and including the date on which such amount is paid to the Paying Agent. The Buyer shall have the right to prepay all or any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount prior to the Deferred Payment Date, provided, however, that if the Buyer opts to pay a portion, but not all, of the Deferred Payment Amount prior to the Deferred Payment Date, such payment shall be in an aggregate amount of no less than $2,000,000 (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change of Control, Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Deferred Payment Amount (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) _less_ (i) any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount previously paid to the Paying Agent, (ii) any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount which the Buyer was permitted to deduct in accordance with Section 2.8(b) and (iii) the General Indemnity Amount. Following a Change of Control and on the Deferred Payment Date, the Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent the General Indemnity Amount (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) less any amounts which are the subject of a pending claim made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article VIII prior to the Deferred Payment Date. The Buyer shall promptly pay to the Paying Agent any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount which is not paid when due by the Buyer to the Paying Agent hereunder as a result of a claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article VIII upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved in accordance with Article VIII less any amounts that are finally resolved in accordance with Article VIII to be owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to such indemnity claim. Such portion of the Deferred Payment Amount which is paid to the Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved shall continue to accrue interest at LIBOR plus 3% per annum through the date actually paid to the Paying Agent. The portion of the Deferred Payment Amount that is not paid to the Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved shall accrue interest at LIBOR plus 3% per annum through and including the date upon which the indemnity claim was made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article VIII and such accrued interest shall be paid to the Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved in accordance with Article VIII. 

  

 (b) The Deferred Payment Amount shall be subject to automatic reduction on a dollar for dollar basis in the event of (i) Dissenters Rights Payments in accordance with Section 2.7(b) or (c), (ii) Adjustment Amount Payments in accordance with the penultimate sentence of Section 2.3(d), (iii) Taxes due with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Returns in accordance with Section 6.11(c) and (iv) any amount determined to be due to a Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with Article VIII. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Subordination of Deferred Payment Amounts_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions of this Section 2.8, each Stockholder (other than those dissenting stockholders exercising rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL who do not receive a cash payment in the Merger pursuant to Article II) and Option Holder who delivers an executed Option Acknowledgement (each a " _Subordinated Holder_ " and collectively the " _Subordinated Holders_ " ) hereby subordinates, in right of payment and claim, any Deferred Payment Amount owing to such Subordinated Holder to all Senior Debt. The Stockholders Representative and each Subordinated Holder agrees not to ask for, demand, sue for, take or receive from the Buyer, by payment, set off or in any other manner (other than reductions as set forth in Section 2.8(b) above), the whole, or any part, of any Deferred Payment Amount unless and until all Senior Debt shall have been paid in full in cash, or otherwise Fully Supported (as defined in the Buyer Credit Agreement) on terms satisfactory to the Senior Agent and the Buyer Credit Agreement shall have terminated (such payment, satisfaction and termination being referred to as " _Senior Debt Satisfaction_ "); provided, however, that (i) prior to receipt of a Payment Default Notice or Non-Payment Default Notice in accordance with Sections 2.8(d) or 2.8(e) hereof, and (ii) if (x) a Non-Payment Default Notice has been delivered, after the applicable Payment Blockage Termination Date (as defined in Section 2.8(e) below) or (y) a Payment Default Notice has been delivered, after the date on which the Payment Default shall have been waived in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Credit Agreement, the Subordinated Holders may receive payments representing the Deferred Payment Amount (and accrued and unpaid interest thereon) as provided in this Agreement (including on the Deferred Payment Date). 

   

 (ii) No Subordinated Holder shall (A) obtain or maintain any lien or security interest in any property, tangible or intangible, of the Buyer or any Guarantor as security for payment of the Deferred Payment Amounts or (B) take, or consent to or acquiesce in, the taking of, any action to set aside, challenge or otherwise dispute the existence or priority of any Senior Debt or the creation, attachment, perfection or continuation of any lien or security interest of the Senior Agent or the Senior Lenders in any assets of the Buyer or the Guarantors. 

  

 (d) _Payment Default in Respect of Senior Debt_. Following the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Buyer Credit Agreement) arising from the nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due under the Buyer Credit Agreement (a " _Payment Default_ " ) and receipt by the Stockholders Representative from the Senior Agent of written notice (a " _Payment Default Notice_ ") of the occurrence of such Payment Default stating that such notice is a payment blockage notice pursuant to Section 2.8(d) of this Agreement, unless and until such default shall have been waived in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Credit Agreement, no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property or securities or by set-off or otherwise), other than reductions as set forth in Section 2.8(b) above, shall be made or agreed to be made on account of any Deferred Payment Amount, or in respect of any redemption, retirement, purchase, prepayment or other acquisition or payment of any Deferred Payment Amount, and the Subordinated Holders will not ask for, demand or accept any such payment. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Non-Payment Default in Respect of Senior Debt_. Following the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Buyer Credit Agreement) other than a Payment Default (a " _Non-Payment Default_ ") and upon receipt by the Stockholders Representative from the Agent of written notice (a " _Non-Payment Default Notice_ " ) of the happening of such Non-Payment Default, stating that such notice is a payment blockage notice pursuant to Section 2.8(e) of this Agreement, no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property or securities or by set-off or otherwise), other than reductions as set forth in Section 2.8(b) above, shall be made or agreed to be made for or on account of any Deferred Payment Amount or in respect of any redemption, retirement, repurchase, prepayment, purchase or other acquisition or payment of any Deferred Payment Amount, nor shall any Subordinated Holder ask for, demand or accept any such payment, for a period (each, a " _Payment Blockage Period_ " ) commencing on the date of receipt by the Shareholders Representative of such Non-Payment Default Notice and ending on the Payment Blockage Termination Date (defined below) relating to such Payment Blockage Period; provided, however, that: 

   

 (i) only one such Payment Blockage Period may arise in any period of three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days; and 

   

 (ii) no Payment Blockage Period may be imposed as a result of any Non-Payment Default which served as the basis for, or was continuing during, a previous Payment Blockage Period unless such Nonpayment Default shall have been cured for a period of not less than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 

 

The term " _Payment Blockage Termination Date_ " means, with respect to any
Payment Blockage Period, the earliest of (i) the date which is one hundred
eighty (180) days after the date of receipt by the Shareholders
Representative of the Nonpayment Default Notice commencing such Payment
Blockage Period and (ii) the date on which all Non-Payment Defaults giving
rise to such Payment Blockage Period shall have been waived in accordance
with the Buyer Credit Agreement. 

  

All payments in respect of Deferred Payment Amount postponed during any
Payment Blockage Period shall be immediately due and payable upon the
termination thereof. 

   

 (f) _Standstill_. If a Payment Default Notice or a Non-Payment Default Notice has been delivered to the Stockholders Representative, no action may be taken by any Subordinated Holder to accelerate the Deferred Payment Amount or to enforce or collect payment on the Deferred Payment Amount or to commence, or join with any other creditor (other than the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders) in commencing, any bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or insolvency proceeding, until the earlier to occur of any of the following (a " _Standstill Termination Date_ " ): 

   

 (i) the date Senior Debt Satisfaction shall have occurred; 

    

 (ii) the date on which the outstanding Obligations (as defined in the Buyer Credit Agreement) are accelerated and become due and payable in full; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) 180 days after the delivery of a Payment Default Notice or a Non-Payment Default Notice; and 

   

 (iv) The date on which all Non-Payment Defaults or Payment Defaults described in the Payment Default Notice or Non-Payment Default Notice shall have been waived in accordance with the Buyer Credit Agreement. 

 

Following the occurrence of the Standstill Termination Date, the Stockholders
Representative and the Subordinated Holders may take any action available
under this Agreement or otherwise available under applicable law to enforce
the Buyers obligations of payment with respect to the Deferred Payment
Amount. 

   

 (g) _Bankruptcy Distributions_. The Stockholders Representative and each Subordinated Holder agrees that, in the event of any distribution, division or application, partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, of all or any part of the assets of the Buyer or the proceeds thereof to creditors of Buyer upon any indebtedness of the Buyer, by reason of the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Buyer or the Buyers business, or, in the event of any sale, receivership, insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding by or against the Buyer for any relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or laws relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of indebtedness, liquidations, reorganizations, compositions, or extensions, then and in any such event, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable to the Stockholders Representative or any Subordinated Holder upon or with respect to any or all the Deferred Payment Amount shall be paid (and the Stockholders Representative or the Subordinated Holders, as applicable, shall direct the debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy, as appropriate, to pay) or delivered directly to the Senior Agent for application against the Senior Debt, whether due or not due, in a manner which the Senior Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine, until Senior Debt Satisfaction shall have occurred. Each Subordinated Holder hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers the Senior Agent to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, and receive for every such payment or distribution and give acquittance therefor, and to file claims (and proofs of claims) and take such other proceedings in Senior Agents own name or in the name of each Subordinated Holder as the Senior Agent may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of the subordination terms of this Section 2.8 and, in connection therewith, each Subordinated Holder agrees to grant to the Senior Agent such powers of attorney, assignments or other instruments as may be requested by the Senior Agent in order to enable the Senior Agent to enforce any and all claims upon or with respect to any or all of the Deferred Payment Amount and to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time upon or with respect thereto. 

 

This Agreement shall be applicable both before and after the filing of any
petition by or against the Buyer under any federal, state or foreign
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or receivership or similar law, and
all allocations of payments between the Senior Creditors, on the one hand,
and the Subordinated Holders on the other hand, shall continue to be made
after the filing thereof on the same basis that the payments were to be
applied prior to the date of the petition, as if such petition had not been
filed. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) _Receipts by Subordinated Holders held in Trust_. Should any payment or distribution be received by the Stockholders Representative or any Subordinated Holder upon or with respect to the Deferred Payment Amount in contravention of the subordination terms of this Section 2.8, the Stockholders Representative and each Subordinated Holder agrees forthwith to deliver the same to the Senior Agent in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of Subordinated Holder where the Senior Agent, in its sole discretion, deems same to be necessary), for application against the Senior Debt, whether due or not due, and until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Stockholders Representative or such Subordinated Holder, as applicable, as property of the Senior Agent. In the event of the failure of the Stockholders Representative or any Subordinated Holder to make any such endorsement or assignment, the Senior Agent, or any of its officers or employees on behalf of the Senior Agent, are hereby irrevocably authorized to make the same. 

  

 (i) _No Assignment of Deferred Payment Amount_. No Subordinated Holder may assign or transfer to others any claim such Subordinated Holder has or may have against the Buyer with respect to any Deferred Payment Amount while any of the Senior Debt remains unpaid. 

  

 (j) _No Amendment of Deferred Payment Amount_. The Subordinated Holders and the Buyer will not, without the prior written consent of the Senior Agent, amend or modify any provision of this Agreement relating to the Deferred Payment Amount if such amendment or modification would (a) move forward the date of any payment or increase the amount of the Deferred Payment or the rate of interest applicable to the Deferred Payment Amount or (b) result in any provision being more restrictive on the Buyer than those in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (k) _No Impairment of Subordination_. No right of the Senior Agent, any Senior Lender or any future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce the subordination as provided in this Agreement shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Buyer or any act or failure to act by the Senior Agent, any Senior Lender or any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Buyer with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the Senior Agent or any Senior Lender may have or otherwise be charged with. The Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders may, without notice to or consent of the Stockholders Representative or any Subordinated Holder, (i) extend, renew, modify or amend the terms of the Buyer Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document and the Senior Debt (including increasing the aggregate amount of or interest rate applicable to such debt and changing any terms of payment) or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange such security or release any Person in any manner liable for such Senior Debt, (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Buyer, any Guarantor or any other Person (including any Subordinated Holder) and (iii) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any Senior Debt in such manner as the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders may determine. 

  

 (l) _Third Party Beneficiary_. The agreements relating to subordination made in this Section 2.8 are solely for the purpose of establishing the relative priorities of the Subordinated Holders, on one hand, and the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders, on the other hand. The Senior Agent and each Senior Lender are intended third-party beneficiaries of the subordination terms hereof. The agreements in this Section 2.8 shall not inure to the benefit of any other person or entity, except the successors and assigns of the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (m) _Defense by Buyer_. If any Subordinated Holder should commence or participate in any action or proceeding against the Buyer contrary to this Section 2.8, the Buyer may interpose as a defense or dilatory plea the making of this Agreement, and the Senior Agent may intervene and interpose such defense or plea in the Senior Agents name or in the name of the Buyer. 

  

 (n) _Reliance by Senior Creditors; Subordinated Holders  Waivers_. 

   

 (i) The Subordinated Holders hereby expressly waive all notice of the acceptance by the Senior Agent or the Senior Lenders of the subordination and other provisions of this Agreement and all other notices not specifically required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement whatsoever, and the Subordinated Holders expressly consent to reliance by the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders upon the subordination and other agreements herein provided. 

   

 (ii) The Subordinated Holders hereby agree that the Senior Creditors have not made any representations or warranties with respect to the due execution, legality, validity, completeness or enforceability of the Buyer Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or the collectibility of the Senior Debt, and further agree that the Senior Agent and the Senior Lenders shall be entitled to manage and supervise the Senior Debt in accordance with applicable law and its usual practices, modified from time to time as they deem appropriate under the circumstances. 

   

 (iii) The Subordinated Holders hereby waive the right to require the Senior Agent or the Senior Lenders to marshal any assets of Buyer for the benefit of the Subordinated Holders. 

  

 (o) _Notices_. Any notice delivered pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by the Stockholders Representative and each Subordinated Holder and be effective (i) on the day on which delivered (including hand delivery by commercial courier service) to such party (against receipt therefor), (ii) on the date of receipt at such address, telefacsimile number or telex number as may from time to time be specified by such party in written notice to the other parties hereto or otherwise received), in the case of notice by telegram, telefacsimile or telex, respectively (where the receipt of such message is verified by return), or (iii) on the fifth Business Day after the day on which mailed, if sent prepaid by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, in each case delivered, transmitted or mailed, as the case may be, to the address, telex number or telefacsimile number, as appropriate, set forth for the Stockholders Representative in Section 11.3 hereof or such other address or number as such party shall specify.

ARTICLE III  

   

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_  

   

 The Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as presently contemplated to be conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary because of the property owned, leased or operated by it or because of the nature of its business as now being conducted and as presently contemplated to be conducted, except for any failure to so qualify or be in good standing that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company prior to. or concurrently with, the execution of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ " or the " _Schedules_ "), lists the jurisdictions of incorporation and qualifications to do business (or the foreign equivalents, if any) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or in violation of any provision of its respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other constitutive documents. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and correct list of the directors and officers of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or otherwise for Taxes of any other corporation affiliated with the Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date,  _provided_ that the Stockholders and Option Holders shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) to the extent of the amount of Taxes taken into account as current liabilities in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital. For purposes of this Section 8.3, the Principal Stockholders shall be deemed to be one Stockholder and shall therefore be jointly and severally liable as to each other for any obligation which a Principal Stockholder may have under this Section 8.3(a). 

  

 (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be, (A) in the case of Taxes other than property Taxes determined under the closing of the books method and (B) in the case of property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes with respect to such periods under the relevant Tax law) (or in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this paragraph (b). In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 8.3(b) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

 

With respect to any Tax for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement, the amount of any such indemnity payment shall be increased so
that after the payment of any Tax on any indemnification payment the
indemnity payment equals the amount of the indemnification under this Section
8.3 incurred by the indemnified party under this Section 8.3. The parties
agree to treat any payments under this Section 8.3 as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration. 

   

 SECTION 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) If any party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under this Article VIII (other than a Tax Claim contest, provisions for which are provided for pursuant to Section 6.11(d) hereof) (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the party or parties from which indemnification is sought hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period prior to the Indemnified Party giving such notice). The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of a Third Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, if (i) within 15 days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such defense and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is a party to the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party has not determined in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict in interest. The Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Indemnified Party in its sole discretion) in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, in the good faith determination of the Indemnified Partys counsel, representation by the Indemnifying Partys counsel may present a conflict of interest, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof with counsel of its own choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully assist and cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim or demand. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If, _however_ , the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If an Indemnified Party shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature, the amount thereof, to the extent known, and the basis for indemnification sought. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. 

  

 SECTION 8.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholders and Option Holders shall not have any liability under Section 8.1(a)(i) unless the aggregate liability for Losses (other than Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1 [Organization, Standing and Power], Section 3.2 [Authority; Approvals], Section 3.3 [Capitalization; Equity Interests], Section 3.9 [Environmental Matters], Section 3.13 [Tax Matters], Subsections (b) through (n) of Section 3.14 [Labor Relations; Employees] and Section 3.16 [Brokers] (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds $325,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "). Once the Basket Amount is exceeded, the Stockholders and Option Holders shall not have any liability under Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than for Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the Fundamental Representations) until the aggregate of Losses in excess of the Basket Amount exceeds $100,000 (the " _Tipping Basket Amount_ " _)_ , in which event the Stockholders and Option Holders shall be liable for all of the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount including the Tipping Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the aggregate liability of the Stockholders and Option Holders for Losses arising under Section 8.3 or under Section 8.1(a)(i) which result from or arise out of breaches of the Fundamental Representations shall not exceed the General Indemnity Amount _plus_ $10,000,000 _less_ any amounts paid by a Stockholder or Option Holder or deducted from the Deferred Payment Amount to cover indemnification claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party, (ii) the aggregate liability of the Stockholders and Option Holders for Losses arising under Section 8.3 or under Section 8.1(a)(i) which result from or arise out of breaches of the Fundamental Representations which are made after the Deferred Payment Date shall not exceed $10,000,000 _less_ any amounts paid by a Stockholder or Option Holder or deducted from the Deferred Payment Amount to cover indemnification claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party and (iii) the aggregate liability of the Stockholders and Option Holders under Section 8.1(a)(i), except as set forth in (i) and (ii) above, shall not exceed the General Indemnity Amount _less_ any amounts paid by a Stockholder or Option Holder or deducted from the Deferred Payment Amount to cover indemnification claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent the liability for Losses under Section 8.1(a)(i) arises as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary (other than a Fundamental Representation), and such Losses occur at any time between the Deferred Payment Date and the date that is the three (3) year 

   ##### 

  

 

anniversary of the Closing Date, the aggregate liability of the Stockholders
and Option Holders with respect to such claims shall not exceed the lesser of
(x) $1,500,000 and (y) the General Indemnity Amount less the aggregate
amounts paid by a Stockholder or Option Holder or deducted from the Deferred
Payment Amount to cover indemnification claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholders
and Option Holders shall not be responsible for indemnifiable Losses suffered
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties to the extent reserved or provided for on
the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any liability under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate liability for Losses (other than Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1 [Organization, Power and Authority], Section 4.2 [Authority; Approvals] and Section 4.5 [Brokers]) suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds the Basket Amount. Once the Basket Amount is exceeded, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any liability under Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1 [Organization, Power and Authority], Section 4.2 [Authority; Approvals] and Section 4.5 [Brokers]) until the aggregate of Losses in excess of the Basket Amount exceeds the Tipping Basket Amount, in which event the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all of the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount including the Tipping Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate liability of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall not exceed the General Indemnity Amount other than (i) Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1 [Organization, Power and Authority], Section 4.2 [Authority; Approvals] and Section 4.5 [Brokers] for which the aggregate liability of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall not exceed the General Indemnity Amount _plus_ $10,000,000 _less_ any amounts paid by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to cover indemnification claims by a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder and (ii) Losses arising after the Deferred Payment Date for which the aggregate liability of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall not exceed $10,000,000 less any indemnification payments made by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) in excess of the General Indemnity Amount. 

  

 (c) The amount of any Losses that any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 8.3 shall be reduced to reflect any Tax Benefit (as defined below) realized, in the year in which the indemnity payment is required to be made or in any prior year, by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that the claim with respect to which an indemnity obligation arises has not given rise to a Tax Benefit in a prior year or in the year in which the indemnity payment is to be made, but gives rise to a Tax Benefit in a later year, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if such Tax Benefit is realized. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Benefit_ " means any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance that actually reduces in cash the amount of Tax the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation would have been required to pay (or actually increases in cash the amount of Tax refund to which Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation would 

   ##### 

  

 

have been entitled) in the absence of the item giving rise to the indemnity
claim. For purposes hereof, a Tax Benefit shall only be deemed realized in
any tax year when and to the extent a Tax saving or Tax refund is actually
received with respect to the item giving rise to the indemnity claim. For
purposes of determining the amount of any payment due to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation shall be
deemed to use all other deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or
other allowances of the Surviving Corporation or any of any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation (to the extent that such deductions, amortizations,
exclusions from income or other allowances are entitled to be used under
applicable Tax law) prior to the use of any Tax Benefits in respect of which
Buyer is obligated to pay the Indemnifying Party hereunder. 

   

 (d) The amount of any Losses that any Indemnified Party is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced by any related recoveries to which the Indemnified Party actually receives under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any such Losses. If an Indemnified Party actually receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any previously unpaid or unreimbursed expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. At the Indemnifying Partys request, the Indemnified Party (at the Indemnifying Partys expense) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage or from such other party alleged to have responsibility therefor, provided, however, no Indemnified Party shall be required to commence or pursue any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding to collect thereon. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such third party the amount of such indemnification payment. 

  

 (e) The parties hereto intend and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyers and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties sole recourse against such Stockholders and Option Holders for any claim with respect to a breach of this Agreement shall be governed by, and subject to the terms and provisions of, this Article VIII and Section 2.8 other than on account of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Any amounts owing to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall (i) first be paid through a dollar for dollar reduction in the amount of the Deferred Payment Amount and (ii) second be paid by the Stockholders and the Option Holders in accordance with the terms hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that any amounts owed under Section 8.1(a)(i) (other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations and the penultimate sentence of Section 8.5(a)) shall be payable solely through a dollar for dollar reduction in the amount of the Deferred Payment Amount. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no party hereto shall be liable to any other party hereto (including its respective heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns, as the case may be, hereunder) for any consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages pursuant to this Article VIII (other than with respect to claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation), whether for breach of representation or warranty or of covenant or other agreement or any obligation arising therefrom or otherwise, whether liability is asserted in contract or tort (including negligence and strict product liability) and regardless of whether such party has been advised of the possibility of any such loss or damage. Each party hereto hereby waives any claims that these exclusions deprive such party of an adequate remedy. 

  

 (g) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation) that it may have against any other party hereto or any other partys Affiliates arising under or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII or for specific performance or other equitable remedies). 

  

 (h) Following the Closing, the Stockholders and Option Holders expressly waive any right of indemnity and contribution from the Company, its Subsidiaries or their successors or assigns (including the Surviving Corporation, Buyer and Merger Sub) in connection with any indemnity claims made by the Buyer or Merger Sub against the Stockholders or Option Holders pursuant to this Article VIII or claims made by the Buyer or Merger Sub against the Stockholders or Option Holders for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

  

 (i) For purposes of Article VIII, including the calculation of Losses and determination of the inaccuracy or breach subject to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Buyer, Principal Stockholders, Stockholders Representative and the Company contained in this Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant hereto, shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including, without limitation, the word "material") or Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 SECTION 8.6 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and shall terminate at the close of business on the Deferred Payment Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties under Section 3.1 [Organization, Standing and Power], Section 3.2 [Authority; Approvals], Section 3.3 [Capitalization; Equity Interests], Section 3.16 [Brokers], Section 4.1 [Organization, Power and Authority], Section 4.2 [Authority; Approvals] and Section 4.5 [Brokers] which shall last indefinitely and Section 3.9 [Environmental Matters], Section 3.13 [Tax Matters] and Subsections (b) through (n) of Section 3.14 [Labor Relations; Employees] shall terminate at the close of business five years following the Closing and (ii) inasmuch as the representations and warranties are not listed in 8.6(i) above and are made with regard to a Foreign Subsidiary, such 

   ##### 

  

 

representations and warranties shall terminate at the close of business three
years following the Closing. The agreements contained in Article II, Article
VI, Article IX, Article XI and Article XII shall survive the Closing solely
for purposes of Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and shall survive indefinitely (except
to the extent that a shorter period of time is explicitly specified
therein). The provisions of Section 8.3 shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate at the close of business five years following the Closing. No party
shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with respect to any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the
termination thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if written notice of a claim has been given by an Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the provisions hereof and prior
to the termination of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, then the relevant representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall survive as to such claim until the claim has been finally
resolved. 

   

ARTICLE IX  

   

 _Stockholders  Representative_ 

   

 SECTION 9.1 _Stockholders  Representative_. 

  

 (a) _Appointment_. Each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, constitutes and appoints Stockholders Representative to act as such Persons representative under this Agreement, with full authority to act on behalf of, and to bind, each such Person for purposes of this Agreement, and Stockholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment. Stockholders Representative shall have full power and authority to represent all of such holders and their successors with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement and all actions taken by Stockholders Representative hereunder and thereunder shall be binding upon all such holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Stockholders Representative shall take any and all actions that it believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of such holders, as fully as if such holders were acting on their own behalf, including dealing with Buyer and the Paying Agent under this Agreement with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement, taking any and all other actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement, and engaging counsel, accountants or other Stockholders Representatives, in connection with the foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Stockholders Representative shall have full power and authority to effect and interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the determination of the Adjustment Amount, the prosecution, defense or settlement of any claims for indemnification under Article VIII and the authorization of disbursements and payments in accordance with Section 9.2) and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all such holders and their successors. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry of any Stockholder or Option Holder, upon any written decision, act, consent or instruction of Stockholders Representative. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation are each hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by it in accordance with such written decision, act, consent or instruction of Stockholders Representative. Any notice or communication delivered by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to Stockholders Representative shall, as between Buyer, Merger Sub and the 

   ##### 

  

 

Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Stockholders and Option
Holders, on the other, be deemed to have been delivered to all Stockholders
and Option Holders. Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely exclusively upon any communications or writings given or
executed by Stockholders Representative in connection with any claims for
indemnity and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action
taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or
communications or writings given or executed by Stockholders Representative.
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to disregard
any notices or communications given or made by any Stockholders and Option
Holders in connection with any claims for indemnity unless given or made
through Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (b) _Indemnification of Stockholders  Representative_. Stockholders Representative may act upon any instrument or other writing believed by Stockholders Representative in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person and shall not be liable in connection with the performance by it of its duties pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, except for its own willful default or gross negligence. Stockholders Representative shall be, and hereby is, indemnified and held harmless, jointly and severally, by each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, from all losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) that may be incurred by Stockholders Representative as a result of Stockholders Representatives performance of its duties under this Agreement; _provided_ that Stockholders Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification for losses, costs or expenses that result from any action taken or omitted by Stockholders Representative as a result of its own willful default or gross negligence. Any amounts owed to the Stockholders Representative hereunder shall be paid to the Stockholders Representative by the Paying Agent from any Deferred Payment Amount or Adjustment Amount received by the Paying Agent for subsequent payment to the Stockholders and Option Holders in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 (c) _Reasonable Reliance_. In the performance of its duties hereunder, Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any document or instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) or Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, or Buyer. Stockholders Representative may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. 

  

 (d) _Attorney-in-Fact_. 

   

 (i) Stockholders Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, with full power in their name and on their behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement in the absolute discretion of Stockholders Representative; and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including, without limitation, executing and delivering any other agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with this Agreement. Such appointment shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable, subject to replacement of Stockholders Representative pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and shall not be terminated by any act of any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), or any Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, by operation of Law, whether by such holders death, disability, protective supervision or any other event. Without limitation to the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, hereby renounces its, his or her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally. 

   

 (iii) Each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, waives any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of Stockholders Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this Section 9.1, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be ineffective by reason only of a Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) or an Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, having signed or given such act or document directly instead of Stockholders Representative. 

  

 (e) _Liability_. If Stockholders Representative is required to determine the occurrence of any event or contingency, Stockholders Representative shall, in making such determination, be liable to each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), and each Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, only for Stockholders Representatives proven bad faith as determined in light of all the circumstances, including the time and facilities available to it in the ordinary conduct of business. In determining the occurrence of any such event or contingency, Stockholders Representative may request from any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), or Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, or any other Person such reasonable additional evidence as Stockholders Representative in its sole discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the occurrence of such event or contingency, and may at any time inquire of and consult with others, including any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) or Option Holder who executes and delivers an Option Acknowledgement, as the case may be, and Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any such holder for any damages resulting from its delay in acting hereunder pending its receipt and examination of additional evidence requested by it. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Successor Representatives_. Stockholders Representative shall designate one or more Persons to serve as successor Stockholders Representative in the event of its death, incapacity, bankruptcy or dissolution, which Person or Persons shall in such event succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of Stockholders Representative under this Agreement. Each successor Stockholders Representative shall designate one or more successors to serve as Stockholders Representative in the event of such successor Stockholders Representatives death, incapacity, bankruptcy or dissolution. 

  

 SECTION 9.2 _Certain Disbursements from the Paying Agent of amounts relating to Deferred Payment and Adjustment Amounts_. 

  

 (a) In the event that a Stockholder or Option Holder is jointly and severally liable for the payment of any Adjustment Amount under Section 2.3 or for indemnification under Section 6.14(a) or Article VIII and such Person has not paid or contributed (either directly or indirectly through a reduction in the Deferred Payment Amount that such Person would otherwise be entitled) with respect to such matter an amount (such Persons " _Pro Rata Amount_ ") equal to the product of (i) the aggregate amount owed by all Stockholders and Option Holders with respect to such matter and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration entitled to be received by such Person hereunder with respect to such Persons Shares and Options by (y) the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be received in respect of all outstanding Shares and Options, the Stockholders Representative may instruct the Paying Agent not to pay to such Person from any Adjustment Amount or Deferred Payment Amount received by the Paying Agent from the Buyer hereunder up to an amount equal to (1) such Persons Pro Rata Amount with respect to such matter minus (2) the amount such Person paid or contributed (either directly or indirectly through a reduction in the Deferred Payment Amount that such Person would otherwise be entitled) with respect to such matter, and instead pay over such amount to such other Stockholders and Option Holders on a pro rata basis to the extent any such Persons paid more than such Persons pro rata share based on the formula set forth in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to such matter. 

  

 (b) In the event that a Stockholder or Option Holder is obligated to make an indemnification payment under Section 8.1(c) to a Buyer Indemnified Party and the Buyer elects to reduce the amount of the Deferred Payment Amount that would otherwise have been payable, any such reduction shall only reduce the amount that would otherwise have been payable to such Stockholder or Option Holder, as the case may be, from the Deferred Payment Amount and not reduce the amount that would otherwise be payable to the other Stockholders and Option Holders.
