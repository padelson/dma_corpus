Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
Disputed Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The resolution of the Disputed Items by
the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent
Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon

Aggregate Merger Consideration that would otherwise have been required to be paid at Closing to the
Stockholders and Option Holders hereunder (the &#147;<I>Deferred Payment Amount</I>&#148;) shall be deferred and
shall be due and payable by the Buyer to the Paying Agent (for subsequent payment to the
Stockholders and Option Holders in accordance herewith), by wire transfer to an account designated
by the Paying Agent, no later than the date that is the fifteen (15)&nbsp;month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the &#147;<I>Deferred Payment Date</I>&#148;). All or any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount paid
to the Paying Agent hereunder shall be paid together with interest thereon, which interest shall
accrue at LIBOR plus 3% per annum, compounded quarterly, beginning on the day immediately following
the Closing Date and continuing through and including the date on which such amount is paid to the
Paying Agent. The Buyer shall have the right to prepay all or any portion of the Deferred Payment
Amount prior to the Deferred Payment Date, provided, however, that if the Buyer opts to pay a
portion, but not all, of the Deferred Payment Amount prior to the Deferred Payment Date, such
payment shall be in an aggregate amount of no less than $2,000,000 (plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a Change of Control, Buyer shall pay to the
Paying Agent an amount equal to the Deferred Payment Amount (including any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon) <I>less </I>(i)&nbsp;any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount previously paid to the Paying
Agent, (ii)&nbsp;any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount which the Buyer was permitted to deduct in
accordance with Section&nbsp;2.8(b) and (iii)&nbsp;the General Indemnity Amount. Following a Change of
Control and on the Deferred Payment Date, the Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent the General
Indemnity Amount (including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) less any amounts which are the
subject of a pending claim made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article&nbsp;VIII prior to the
Deferred Payment Date. The Buyer shall promptly pay to the Paying Agent any portion of the
Deferred Payment Amount which is not paid when due by the Buyer to the Paying Agent hereunder as a
result of a claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article&nbsp;VIII upon such
indemnity claim being finally resolved in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII less any amounts that are
finally resolved in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII to be owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to such indemnity claim. Such portion of the Deferred Payment Amount which is paid to the
Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved shall continue to accrue interest at
LIBOR plus 3% per annum through the date actually paid to the Paying Agent. The portion of the
Deferred Payment Amount that is not paid to the Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being
finally resolved shall accrue interest at LIBOR plus 3% per annum through and including the date
upon which the indemnity claim was made by a Buyer Indemnified Party under Article&nbsp;VIII and such
accrued interest shall be paid to the Paying Agent upon such indemnity claim being finally resolved
in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII.

other than Permitted IP Liens (as defined below). The issued patents and registered copyrights,
registered trademarks and registered service marks included in the Registered Intellectual Property
have been duly maintained, are valid and are in full force and effect in all material respects.
