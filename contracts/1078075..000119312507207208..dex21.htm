the Merger and the fact that such NetGen SARs are neither being assumed or
substituted by NetScout) shall be canceled in exchange for a payment equal to
the excess of: (i) the number of shares of NetGen Common Stock subject thereto
multiplied by Total Consideration Per Share over (ii) the aggregate base
price thereof. Such payment shall be in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, no
portion of the Escrow Consideration shall be required to be withheld from the
payments made pursuant to this Section 2.10. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the vested portion of all of the then outstanding out-of-the-
money NetGen Stock Options and the unvested portion of NetGen SARs shall be
canceled without any payment made therefor. 

(c) NetGen and its Board of Directors shall promptly take all actions
necessary to provide for the treatment of the NetGen Options and NetGen SARs
as provided by this Section 2.10. A listing of all NetGen Stock Options and
NetGen SARs and the vesting schedules thereof will be included in the
Distribution Schedule. NetGen may permit the holders of NetGen Stock Options
and NetGen SARs to exercise the vested portion of such awards at any time
prior to the Effective Time; provided that any Person who exercises an NetGen
Stock Option or NetGen SAR more than 20 days after the date of this Agreement
shall be treated as a Non-Accredited Holder with respect to the shares of
NetGen Common Stock acquired as a result of such exercise. NetGen shall
obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent from each holder of an NetGen Stock
Option and, NetGen SAR or NetGen Deferred Share Award to the termination
thereof unless such consent is not required under the terms of the applicable
agreement, instrument or plan. NetGen shall also terminate effective as of the
Effective Time all of its stock option and stock purchase plans or other
equity incentive compensation plans, including without limitation, the NetGen
Stock Plans.



 

\- 15 - 2.11 _Withholding_. Each of NetScout and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person under this Article II, such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld under any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
hereof as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

substitution) equal to such substituted Escrow Cash, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the NetScout Indebtedness to the Sponsors in the Escrow Fund in respect
of such Sponsor may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the value of the portion
of the Escrow Fund consisting of Escrow Consideration of such Sponsor as of
the time of substitution, and such NetScout Indebtedness to the Sponsors may
be used by the Escrow Agent to satisfy escrow claims for which such Sponsor is
responsible as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(c) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of NetGen shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and
of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the
aggregate Escrow Consideration in escrow, the appointment of the Stockholders
Representatives and the grant to the Stockholders Representatives of the power
and authority to act on behalf of the stockholders of NetGen in such capacity
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, in each case pursuant to Section 11.03
hereto.



 

\- 16 - 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates Representing NetGen Securities_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately following the Effective Time (but in any
event on the Closing Date), NetScout shall deposit with an exchange
agent selected by NetScout promptly after the date hereof and reasonably
acceptable to NetGen (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of NetGen Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Agreement, an
amount (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") equal to the Total Consideration payable to
them _minus_ (i) the Escrow Consideration, (ii) the product of (A) the Non-
Accredited Consideration Per Share and (B) the total number of Dissenting
Shares held by Non-Accredited Holders, (iii) the product of (A) the Accredited
Cash Consideration Per Share and (B) the total number of Dissenting Shares
held by Accredited Holders, and (iv) the product of (A) the Accredited Stock

Accredited Holders. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event within 5

outstanding certificate or instrument that represents NetGen Stock (the "
_Certificates_ "), a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor, a lost stock
certificate affidavit and indemnity agreement with respect to any NetGen
stockholders who have lost their Certificates, and such other documents the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require in connection with such surrender, in
customary form to be agreed upon by NetGen and the Exchange Agent.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) After the Effective Time, each holder of Certificate(s) shall, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate(s) and a fully and
properly completed Letter of Transmittal and acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive the amount of the Total Consideration
into which such surrendered Certificate(s) have been converted or exchanged
pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 3.01 hereof
With respect to each holder of Certificate(s) who has effected such surrender
not less than 5 days prior to the Closing Date, such holder shall receive
payment of such Total Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in any event on the Closing Date). With respect to
each other holder of Certificate(s), such holder shall receive payment of
such Total Consideration promptly after such surrender by such holder.

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of NetGen or its transfer agent of Certificates, and if Certificates
are presented to NetGen for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery
of the Total Consideration into which such Certificates have been converted
or exchanged pursuant to this Agreement. If any Total Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall properly be endorsed, with signature
guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving Corporation or its
transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required, or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or its transfer agent that such
taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

 

\- 17 - (iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Total Consideration into
which such Certificate has been converted or exchanged pursuant to this
Agreement and after the Effective Time the holders thereof shall cease to
have any other rights as holders of NetGen Stock. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any amount payable to holders of NetGen Stock as Total
Consideration.

(c) _No Further Rights in NetGen Stock_. __ All Total Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the NetGen Stock represented thereby.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates upon the expiration of
two years following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation, and only as general creditors thereof, for payment of
any claim for Total Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, NetScout, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash,
NetScout Stock or other assets from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the later of (i)
two years after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on
which any cash, NetScout Stock or other assets, if any, in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such cash or other assets in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund in U.S. government securities or an insured
money market deposit account selected by NetScout and NetGen prior to the
Closing. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
be paid to NetScout.

default under any material term of any lease or any declaration, restriction,
covenant, option agreement or right of first refusal relating to the Leased

NetGen or any NetGen Subsidiary under any material term of any lease or any
declaration, restriction, covenant, option agreement or right of first refusal
relating to the Leased Premises. NetGen or an NetGen Subsidiary has good and
valid leasehold title to the Leased Premises, free and clear of all
Liens, except Permitted Liens.

(b) NetGen or an NetGen Subsidiary has good and merchantable title to all

only specified employees and representatives of NetScout). All Material
Contracts (whether or not represented by customer agreements) are valid and
existing, and NetGen and NetGen Subsidiaries, have duly performed their
obligations thereunder in all material respects to the extent such
obligations have accrued, and no material breach or default thereunder by
NetGen or any NetGen Subsidiary has occurred and is continuing. Neither NetGen
nor any NetGen Subsidiary is party to any Material Contract which grants
the counterparty any "most favored nations" rights. The Material Contracts
listed on Section 4.14 of the NetGen Disclosure Schedule represent at least
50% of the consolidated bookings for NetGen for the fiscal year ended January

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Employee Plan_ " means each of the
following plans, policies, arrangements and contracts which is sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by NetGen or any NetGen Subsidiary, or, in the
case of any "employee pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), an
ERISA Affiliate, for the benefit of, or pursuant to which there is any
liability to, any current or former employee, director or officer: (i) any
"employee benefit plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
whether or not subject to the provisions of ERISA; and (ii) any other
employment, consulting, collective bargaining, stock option, stock bonus,
stock purchase, phantom stock, incentive, bonus, deferred compensation,
retirement, severance, change-in-control, fringe, insurance, disability, post-
employment (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance
or other benefits), vacation, medical or dental contract, policy or
arrangement which is not an employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA. Section 4.15(a) of the NetGen Disclosure Schedule lists as of the
date hereof each Employee Plan that is maintained in the United States or
covers any current or former employee, director or officer working in the
United States and each material Employee Plan that is maintained outside of
the United States.

(b) With respect to each Employee Plan identified on Section 4.15(a) of the
NetGen Disclosure Schedule, except as set forth in Section 4.15(b) of the
NetGen Disclosure Schedule, NetGen has made available to NetScout true and
complete copies (including amendments) of each existing contract, plan
document and summary plan description (including any related trust agreement
or insurance company contract), plus a copy of the most recent determination
letter, if applicable, and a copy of the most recent Form 5500\. Except as set
forth in Section 4.15(b) of the NetGen Disclosure Schedule, there have been no
amendments to, written interpretations of or announcements by NetGen or any
NetGen Subsidiary published to employees relating to, or any changes in
employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that would
increase  



 

\- 29 -  materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of
expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended
prior to the date hereof, for which financial statements have been provided.

(c) Each Employee Plan has been maintained in compliance in all respects with
its terms and the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statues,
orders, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the
Code. Except as set forth in Section 4.15(c) of the NetGen
Disclosure Schedule,, with respect to each Employee Plan, (1) no actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary
course) have been initiated, or to any Seller Partys knowledge, threatened
(2) to any Seller Partys knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to form the basis of any such actions, suits or
claims, (3) there are no administrative investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental
Entities in progress or pending, or, to any Seller Partys knowledge, or
threatened, and (4) all contributions required to be made with respect to any
Employee Plan have been timely made. With respect to each Employee Plan which
is an "employee benefit plan:" within the meaning of Section 3(3) ERISA or
which is a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e) of the Code, there
has occurred no transaction which is prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or
which constitutes a "prohibited transaction" under Section 4975(c) of the Code
and with respect to which a prohibited transaction exemption has not been
granted and is not currently in effect.

(d) Section 4.15(d) of the NetGen Disclosure Schedule identifies each funded
Employee Plan which is an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (including a multi-employer plan within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA). With respect to each Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, (i) a favorable
IRS determination letter has been received and, since the date of such IRS
submission, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification; (ii)
there has been no termination or partial termination within the meaning of
Section 411(d)(3) of the Code; and (iii) no such Employee Plan is covered by
Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan is a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) and neither NetGen nor any NetGen Subsidiary has
sponsored or contributed to any multiemployer plan at any time during
the six-year period ending on the date hereof.

(e) Each Employee Plan which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
within the good faith meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated
and maintained at all times in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by Article II of this Agreement or as set
forth in either Section 4.15(f) of the NetGen Disclosure Schedule, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
entitle any employee, officer or director to receive severance or other
compensation or benefits from NetGen or any NetGen Subsidiary which would not
otherwise be payable absent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or cause the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of  



 

\- 30 -  any award or entitlement under any Employee Plan, whether or not such
occurrence would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of
Code Section 280G, and whether or not another subsequent action or event (or
lack thereof) in addition to the transactions contemplated hereby would be
required to trigger such occurrence.

(g) To each Seller Partys knowledge, since December 31, 2006, there have been
no governmental audits of the equal employment opportunity practices of
NetGen or any NetGen Subsidiary. To each Seller Partys knowledge, there are

bargaining unit presently being made.

(i) The Seller Parties have made available to NetScout accurate and complete
copies of all material United States and non-United States employee manuals

suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending against NetGen or its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of any Seller Party, threatened against

practices or discrimination complaints.

amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, any

required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Each of the financial statements contained in the NetScout SEC
Reports (i) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of NetScout and the NetScout

\- 38 -  statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes) and

nature required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet or in the

or (iii) that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Except for the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, since the date
of the NetScout Balance Sheet, NetScout and the NetScout Subsidiaries
have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practices. Since the date of the NetScout Balance Sheet
to the date hereof, there have not occurred any events, changes, effects or
developments that, individually or in the aggregate, have had a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, except for the transactions with the
Seller Parties contemplated by this Agreement, none of NetScout, any NetScout
Subsidiary or any Representative of any of the foregoing is involved in
negotiations with any other Person with respect to any acquisition of or
investment in a corporation, joint venture or other entity (other than any
investment by NetScout or any NetScout Subsidiary in any wholly-
owned Subsidiary thereof), by purchase or other acquisition of stock or other
equity interests or assets, including by merger, consolidation or other
business combination or by contribution to capital, in any case in excess of

\- 39 -  satisfy such requirements or that such continued listing of the NetScout
Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market is in any way threatened. NetScout
has taken no action designed to, or which, to NetScout knowledge, may have
the effect of, terminating the registration of the NetScout Common Stock under
the Exchange Act or the delisting of the NetScout Common Stock from the Nasdaq

NetScout Intellectual Property. NetScout or the appropriate NetScout
Subsidiary takes and has taken commercially reasonable measures to protect the

Intellectual Property owned by NetScout or the NetScout Subsidiaries (except
pursuant to agreements with customers entered into in the ordinary course of
business), or (ii) to the knowledge of NetScout, is infringing, violating or
misappropriating any of the NetScout Intellectual Property. Neither the use
of the NetScout Intellectual Property nor the conduct of their respective
businesses infringes or violates, or constitutes a misappropriation of, any
patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other Intellectual Property
rights of any person or entity. Neither NetScout nor any NetScout Subsidiary
has distributed any Open Source Materials that require, as a condition of
distribution of such Open Source Materials, that other software incorporated

and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise
available to the current officers and directors of NetGen by law, charter,
statute, by-law or agreement. The obligations of NetScout and the Surviving

such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under
this Section 7.04 without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party.

7.05 _Reserved_.

7.06 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of NetGen, NetGens Subsidiaries or any of their

Affiliates (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall, directly or indirectly
(i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly and intentionally encourage or facilitate,

NetGen will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations it or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives may have conducted before the date of this Agreement with any
persons other than NetScout with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will
(and will cause its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to) enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or
destroy any confidential information previously furnished by NetGen or such
Subsidiaries or Representatives thereunder and by using its best efforts to
obtain injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms thereof in a
court of competent jurisdiction. NetGen will promptly (within twenty four
hours) advise NetScout following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or of
requests for further communications with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
that pre-dates the date hereof, or of any request for nonpublic information or
access to the books and records of NetGen in connection with a
possible Acquisition Proposal, describing the material terms thereof
(including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or
request for information or access), and will keep NetScout apprised of the

any material changes thereto on a current basis (and in any event no later
than twenty-four hours after the occurrence of any such material changes).



 

\- 49 - (b) NetGen agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.06 by any of its Representatives or any of its Subsidiaries, at the

addition, simultaneously with delivery of such certificate, NetGen shall have
provided to NetScout, as agent for NetGen, a form of notice to the IRS in

Party. Prior to the Closing, each Seller Party shall use its commercially

eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on these
transactions.

7.12 _Employee Benefits; Severance Policy_.

(a) NetScout may, in its sole discretion, substitute employee compensation,
benefit and severance programs for those of NetGen as are comparable with
the programs provided from time to time to NetScouts employees. After the

benefits that are substantially similar to the employee benefits provided by
NetScout to its own similarly situated employees. NetScout shall have no
obligation to continue the existence of any Employee Plan maintained by
NetGen.

adoption of a resolution of the Board of Directors of NetGen, adopted no later
than the day prior to the Closing Date, the form of which shall be provided in
advance of the Closing Date to NetScout and subject to NetScouts reasonable
approval. If such a tax-qualified plan is terminated in accordance with this

Employee Plan to reflect any cessation of accruals or contributions in
connection with such termination.



 

\- 51 - (c) Following the Effective Time, NetScout shall use reasonable efforts to

") full credit for prior service with NetGen for purposes of (i) eligibility
and vesting under any NetScout Employee Plan (as defined below), and (ii)
determination of benefit levels under any NetScout Employee Plan or policy
relating to vacation or severance, in each case for which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered
participation, solely to the extent that such service is recognized by NetGen
under the comparable NetGen Employee Plan, but except where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits or result in credit for periods not
recognized under the terms of the NetScout Employee Plan for any employee of
NetScout. In addition, NetScout shall use reasonable efforts to cause
each NetScout Employee Plan to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations
on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of NetScout and shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause such NetScout Employee Plan to recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing
Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _NetScout Employee Plan_ " means any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), and any
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and

coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits and vacation benefits, for

WARN (or any equivalent or similar state or foreign Law requirement) without
complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN (or
such equivalent or similar requirement).

7.14 _NetScout Actions_. On and after the date hereof, NetScout shall not take
any actions that would reasonably be expected to result in the integration of
the issuance of shares of NetScout Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
with any other issuance of shares of  



 

\- 52 -  NetScout Common Stock, or Securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, NetScout Common Stock under applicable Law or the rules
and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Market, or that would require it under
applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Market to
solicit the consent of its stockholders to the issuance of shares of NetScout
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. Between the date hereof and the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its
terms, NetScout will notify NetGen in writing if it enters into any
negotiations, or executes any letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in
principle or binding agreement, regarding any Significant Acquisition, which
notification shall include a summary of the material terms thereof. Prior to
the Closing, NetScout agrees to either (a) obtain any waivers, consents or
amendments from Silicon Valley Bank (" _SVB_ ") that would be required under

Agreement or (b) terminate the SVB Agreement prior to the Closing.

extent known by NetScout) the facts constituting the basis for such Third
Party Action and the amount of the claimed Damages; _provided, however,_ that
no delay or failure on the part of NetScout in so notifying the Stockholders
Representatives shall relieve the Indemnifying Stockholders of any liability
or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused
by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within 20 days after delivery of
such notification, the Stockholders Representatives may, upon written notice
thereof to NetScout, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to NetScout; _provided that_ the
Stockholders Representatives may not assume control of the defense of a Third
Party Action (x) involving criminal liability, (y) in which equitable relief
is sought against NetScout, or (z) in which the amount of the claim is less
than the Basket or is at least $2,000,000 in excess of the Escrow Fund. If the
Stockholders Representatives do not, or are not permitted under the terms
hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, NetScout
shall control such defense. The non-controlling party may participate in, but
not determine or conduct, such defense at its own expense. The controlling
party shall keep the non-controlling party advised of the status of such
Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the non-controlling party with respect thereto. The

cooperate with and assist the controlling party in the defense of such Third
Party Action, including making available employees and other Representatives
of the non-controlling party. The fees and expenses of counsel to the
NetScout Indemnified Parties with respect to a Third Party Action shall be
considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) NetScout controls the
defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.03
or (ii) the Stockholders Representatives assume control of such defense and
NetScout reasonably concludes, upon receipt of the advice of counsel, that the
NetScout Indemnified Parties and the Stockholders Representatives have
conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such
Third Party Action. The Stockholders Representatives shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of NetScout, which shall not be  



 

\- 58 -  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided, however,_ that
such consent of NetScout shall not be required if (i) such settlement
or judgment includes a complete release of the NetScout Indemnified Parties
from further liability and (ii) such settlement or judgment does not include
any admission of liability on the part of any NetScout Indemnified Party or
impose any equitable relief upon any NetScout Indemnified Party. NetScout
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Representatives, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

be incurred by NetScout and the Claimed Amount of such Damages, to the extent

basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages;

reasonably expected to be incurred by NetScout; and " _Expected Claim Notice_
" shall mean a notice that, as a result of a legal proceeding instituted by or
written claim made by a third party, NetScout reasonably expects to incur
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Article IX. 

(c) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholders
Representatives shall deliver to NetScout a written response (the "
_Response_ ") in which the Stockholders Representatives shall: (i) agree that
a NetScout Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount
(in which case the Stockholders Representatives and NetScout shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a
written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Claimed Amount to such NetScout Indemnified Parties), (ii) agree
that any NetScout Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a portion of the
Claimed Amount (in which case the Stockholders Representatives and NetScout
(without prejudice to its right to seek the full Claimed Amount) shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the
response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse such portion to such NetScout Indemnified Parties), or (iii)
dispute that a NetScout Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.

(d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a dispute as to the liability of the NetGen stockholders for the
Claimed Amount (a " _Dispute_ "), the Stockholders Representatives and
NetScout shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute
is not resolved within such 30-day period, such Dispute shall be resolved in
a state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, in accordance with
Section 11.07. The Stockholders Representatives and NetScout shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent, promptly following the final resolution of the Dispute
(whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or otherwise), a
written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to
what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund shall be disbursed to NetScout
and/or the NetGen stockholders (which notice shall be consistent with the
terms of the resolution of the Dispute).



 

\- 59 - 9.04 _Authority of the Stockholders Representatives_. The Stockholders
Representatives shall have full power and authority on behalf of each NetGen
stockholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all
instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
NetGen stockholders under this Article IX. The Stockholders Representatives
shall have no liability to any NetGen stockholder for any action taken or
omitted on behalf of the NetGen stockholders pursuant to this Article IX.

9.05 _Damage Calculation; Limitations_.

(a) In determining (i) whether a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant has occurred or (ii) the amount of any Damages, any materiality
(including any NetGen Material Adverse Effect) standard contained in
a representation, warranty or covenant shall be disregarded, except in
respect of the second sentence of Section 4.08.

(b) After the Closing (i) the aggregate liability of the Indemnifying
Stockholders for Damages under this Article IX shall not exceed the amount of
the Escrow Fund, unless Damages arise as a result of a breach by any
Indemnifying Stockholder of any representation, warranty or agreement
contained in the Letters of Transmittal or any breach by a Seller Party with
respect to Sections 4.03 and 4.04, for which there shall be no Threshold,
Basket or limitation on liability (provided that no Indemnifying Stockholder
shall be obligated to provide any indemnification in excess of the Total
Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Stockholder), (ii) the
Escrow Fund will be the sole and exclusive source from which the NetScout
Indemnified Parties may collect any Damages from the NetGen stockholders other
than in respect of any breach by them of any representation, warranty or
agreement contained in the Letter of Transmittal or any Ancillary Agreement)
for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Article IX, (iii) the
NetGen stockholders shall not be liable for breaches of Section 9.02(a) (other
than with respect to Sections 4.03 and 4.04) unless and until (A) with
respect to each individual Claimed Amount, the amount of Damages with respect
to such Claimed Amount is $40,000 or greater (the " _Threshold_ ") and (B) the
aggregate Damages for which they would otherwise be liable under Section
9.02(a) exceed $2 million (the " _Basket_ ") (at which point, subject to the
Threshold for each individual Claim Amount, the NetGen stockholders shall
become liable for all Damages in excess of the Basket, provided that
for determining whether the Basket has been satisfied any individual Claimed
Amount of less than $40,000 shall be disregarded); _provided that_ the
limitations set forth in this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud,
(iv) the value of any Escrow Shares shall be deemed to be the NetScout Common
Stock Value and the value of any NetScout Indebtedness to the Sponsors shall
be, on the date of such determination, the aggregate principal amount of such
NetScout Indebtedness to the Sponsors and all interest and premiums accrued
and unpaid thereon through and including such date, and (v) with respect to
any claim by any NetScout Indemnified Party with respect to the Escrow Fund,
the Pro Rata Share of each Indemnifying Stockholders obligations with
respect to such claim shall be satisfied, on a pro rata basis based on value,
from the Escrow Cash, Escrow Shares and NetScout Indebtedness to Sponsors (as
applicable to such Indemnifying Stockholder) of such Indemnifying Stockholder
in the Escrow Fund at such time; _provided, however,_ that each Indemnifying
Stockholder that has Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund at such time shall be
entitled to deliver to the NetScout Indemnified Parties with respect to such
claim, in lieu of some or all of the Escrow Shares of  



 

\- 60 -  such Indemnifying Stockholder that otherwise would have been released from
the Escrow Fund to the NetScout Indemnified Parties (the "
_Substituted Shares_ "), an equivalent value of cash and, upon delivery of
such cash to the NetScout Indemnified Parties, the Substituted Shares shall be
promptly released from the Escrow Fund to such Indemnifying Stockholder.

(c) After the Closing, the rights of NetScout Indemnified Parties under this
Article IX shall be its exclusive remedy with respect to claims resulting
from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement of NetGen contained in this Agreement other
than any representation, warranty or agreement contained in the Letter of
Transmittal or any Ancillary Agreement. With respect to the breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement contained in any Letter of Transmittal
or any Ancillary Agreement, NetScout, on behalf of the NetScout Indemnified
Parties, shall have the option to seek indemnification for such Damages
either directly against the Indemnifying Stockholders or from Escrow Fund.

(d) No Indemnifying Stockholder shall have any right of contribution against
NetGen or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by a Seller
Party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
amount of Damages that the NetScout Indemnified Parties (or any of them) may
recover for claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 shall be
offset, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, against (i) any amounts received by the
NetScout Indemnified Parties (or any of them) in respect of the Damages
forming the basis of such claim for indemnification from any third party
pursuant to any indemnities, warranties, counterclaims, contribution rights or
other similar arrangements, and (ii) any amounts received by the NetScout
Indemnified Parties (or any of them) in respect of the Damages forming the
basis of such claim for indemnification from any third party under any
insurance policy or similar arrangement, it being understood and agreed that
the NetScout Indemnified Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
recover all amounts reasonably available from third parties (whether under
insurance policies or similar arrangements or otherwise).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
amount of Damages that the NetScout Indemnified Parties (or any of them) may
recover for claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 shall be
offset, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, against any tax benefits realized or
realizable by the NetScout Indemnified Parties (or any of them) in respect of
the Damages forming the basis of such claim for indemnification. 

(g) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all Damages after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.



 

\- 61 - (h) Any payments made to the NetScout Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article IX or pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Total Consideration for tax purposes.

(c) by either NetScout or NetGen if the Effective Time shall not have occurred
on or before April 30, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided that_ (i)
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.02(c) is not in material breach of any covenant or other agreement
contained herein and (ii) prior to such date by written notice to NetGen or
NetScout, as applicable, either NetScout or NetGen (if such party shall have
complied with its obligations under Section 7.01 (subject to the limitations
contained therein)) may elect to extend the Termination Date by up to two
successive three-month periods (including all extensions by NetScout and
NetGen, collectively) for the purpose of seeking the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals relating to Antitrust Law.

(d) by NetScout ( _provided that_ NetScout is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if any Seller Party shall have breached (i) any of the covenants or agreements
made by such Seller Party herein or (ii) any of the representations or
warranties made by such Seller Party herein, and in either case,  



 

\- 62 -  such breach (x) is not cured within 30 days following written notice thereof
by NetScout to NetGen, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Termination Date and (y) as a result of such breach one or more of the
conditions to closing under Section 8.01 or 8.02 are not capable of being
satisfied prior to the Termination Date, such that NetScout would not
be obligated to effect the Merger;

(e) by NetGen ( _provided that_ NetGen is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
NetScout or Merger Sub shall have breached (i) any of the covenants or
agreements made by NetScout or Merger Sub herein or (ii) any of the
representations or warranties made by NetScout or Merger Sub herein, and in
either case, such breach (x) is not cured within 30 days following written
notice thereof by NetGen to NetScout, or which breach, by its nature, cannot
be cured prior to the Termination Date and (y) as a result of such breach one
or more of the conditions to closing under Section 8.01 or 8.03 are not
capable of being satisfied prior to the Termination Date, such that NetGen
would not be obligated to effect the Merger; and

(f) by NetScout if the stockholders of NetGen have not approved this Agreement
and the Merger within 5 days of the date hereof.

10.03 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either NetScout or
NetGen as provided in Section 10.02, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of NetScout, NetGen, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 7.02(b), 10.03,
11.01, 11.04, 11.07 and 11.09 shall survive any termination of this Agreement
and (ii) neither NetScout nor NetGen shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its prior material willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement (including any such prior willful breach that
becomes the basis for termination of this Agreement under Sections 10.02(d) or
(e) hereof).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by NetScout or NetGen pursuant to Section
10.02(b)(i) or 10.02(b)(ii) (but only in the event that the Final Restraint
giving rise to the right to terminate relates to Antitrust Law) or 10.02(c)
(but only in the event that the closing conditions set forth in Section
8.01(ii) are not satisfied only due to an Antitrust Law-related Restraint, the
closing conditions set forth in the first sentences of each of Section 8.02(i)
and Section 8.02(ii) are satisfied (treating such termination date as if it
were the Closing Date for this purpose only) and all closing conditions set
forth in Section 8.02(iii), (iv) and (vi) are satisfied, NetScout shall pay to
NetGen the sum of $9 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") within two Business
Days after the time of termination; _provided_ that if termination under this
section occurs after the originally scheduled Termination Date only as a
result of one or more extensions under Section 10.02(c) by NetScout, then the
Termination Fee shall be $20 million.



 

\- 63 - (c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to the preceding provision of
this Section 10.03 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such funds.

(d) NetGen and NetScout agree that the agreements contained in Section
10.03(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that without such agreement NetGen and NetScout would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a
penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate NetGen for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and for losses and damages likely to be incurred or suffered as a
result of termination in the circumstances described in Section 10.03(b),
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If
NetScout fails to pay the amounts due under those sections within the time
periods specified in such sections, NetScout shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by NetGen in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment.

(e) NetGen and NetScout agree that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, payment in full of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
10.03(b) constitutes full performance by NetScout with respect to a
termination of this Agreement under the circumstances provided in Section
10.03(b) (and shall also be the Seller Parties sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any breach by NetScout of this Agreement that may have
occurred prior to such termination, and all other damages or remedies, at law
or in equity (including provisional remedies), that might otherwise have been
available to NetGen upon such termination are waived by NetGen).

10.04 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with this Agreement by the stockholders of
NetGen; _provided, however,_  that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by NetGen stockholders, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement
which changes the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be
delivered to the NetGen stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by
this Agreement, or which adversely affects the intended tax treatment of the
Merger for holders of NetGen Common Stock. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

10.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the  



 

\- 64 -  representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

performance of this Agreement by such Stockholders Representative has been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such

assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such

terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by (x) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar
laws relating to creditors rights generally, (y) general principles of
equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (z) any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

11.04 _Publicity_. NetScout and NetGen shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release without the prior consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however,_ that
NetScout may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation with the Seller Parties and the Stockholders
Representatives, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such
press release as it may determine, after consulting with outside counsel, are
required by law or the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Without limiting the

governed in all respects, by the laws of the State of Delaware, including

proceeding brought against them in any such court. The parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of
any lawsuit, action or other proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement in the courts of the State of Delaware, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such lawsuit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

11.08 _Third Party Rights; Assignment_. Except (x) as specified in Section
7.04 and Section 11.03, (y) the rights of the NetGen stockholders to receive
Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II and III and to commence a

Stockholders to recover, solely through an action brought by NetGen, damages

other remedy to which such parties are entitled at law or in equity.

11.10 _Headings; Interpretation_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is
