Market Value equal to the excess, if any, of the applicable Estimated Required
Balance over the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Transferred Life Assets on
deposited therein; and

 



43 (ii) if the aggregate Fair Market Value, as set forth on the Estimated Life
Asset Report, of the Transferred Life Assets exceeds the sum of the Estimated
Required Balance and the Estimated New York Required Balance, then Sellers and
Purchaser shall cause the Company to transfer to Reinsurer Transferred Life
Assets, as selected by Reinsurer, with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal
to such excess and shall cause the Company to transfer the remainder of the
Transferred Life Assets to the Trust Accounts (as allocated between the Trust
Account and the New York Trust Account at Purchasers direction);

_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the Transferred Life
Assets that are required to be transferred to the Trust Accounts pursuant to
clauses (i) or (ii) above are Non-Trust Assets, then Sellers and Purchaser (at
Purchasers direction) shall cause the Company to transfer such Non-Trust
Assets to Reinsurer rather than to the Trust Account and, in lieu thereof and
in addition to any other obligations of Reinsurer contemplated in clause (i)
above, if applicable, Reinsurer shall transfer to the applicable Trust Account
cash or Eligible Assets (as defined in the applicable Reinsurance Agreement)
having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the
Non-Trust Assets that would have otherwise been transferred to the applicable
Trust Account.

 

(g) At the Closing:

 

(i) in the event that the aggregate Book Value of the COLI Investment Assets
as reflected in the COLI Asset Report (the " _Closing COLI Book Value_ ")
exceeds the Initial COLI Required Balance, (A) Sellers shall cause the Company
to transfer (I) COLI Investment Assets with a Book Value at least equal to the
amount of such excess to Bermuda Reinsurer and (II) all other COLI Investment
Assets to the COLI Trust Account and (B) the Bermuda Reinsurer shall transfer
to the COLI Trust Account cash in an amount equal to the Initial COLI Required
Balance _minus_ an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the COLI
Investment Assets on deposit therein; and

(ii) in the event that the Closing COLI Book Value is less than the Initial
COLI Required Balance, then (A) the Company shall transfer the COLI Investment
Assets to the COLI Trust Account and (B) the Bermuda Reinsurer shall transfer
Eligible Assets (as defined in the COLI Trust Agreement) with a Fair Market
Value in an amount equal to difference of the Initial COLI Required Balance
minus the Fair Market Value of the COLI Investment Assets on deposit therein.

 

(h) All cash required to be transferred on the Closing Date pursuant to
_Section 2.08_ or this _Section 2.09_ shall be transferred by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. Any Transferred Life Assets to be transferred
to a Trust Account shall be transferred in the manner set forth in the
applicable Trust Agreement. Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and assist, at Purchasers or Reinsurers
direction, with respect to the re-registration or re-titling of Transferred
Life Investment Assets.

Balance Sheet_ ") and a Calculation Report as of the Balance Sheet Date, which
Calculation Report shall be prepared in accordance with the Calculation
Report Methods and in a manner consistent with Final Settlement Report (the "
_Post-Closing Calculation Report_ ," and together with the Post-Closing

(b) Following receipt of the Post-Closing Purchaser Report, Sellers shall have
sixty (60) days (the " _Sellers Review Period_ ") to review such Post-Closing
Purchaser Report. In connection with the review of the Post-Closing Purchaser
Report, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to provide to Sellers
and their respective Representatives, upon the request of a Seller,
reasonable access to the Books and Records with respect to the period up to
and including the Closing Date (including any such Books and Records created
after the Closing Date to the extent relating to the period up to and
including the Closing Date), including any accountants work papers or
internal accounting records or reserving papers, files and models in each case
to the extent relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing Purchaser
Report, and Purchaser shall make reasonably available to Sellers and their
respective Representatives personnel of Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Company) that were involved in the preparation of the Post-
Closing Purchaser Report; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent
accountants of Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to Sellers, unless and until Sellers have signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement

 



46  relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants. If Sellers, in compliance with the
preceding sentence, have accepted the Post-Closing Purchaser Report in
writing or have not given written notice to Purchaser setting forth any
objection to the Post-Closing Purchaser Report (a " _Sellers Statement of
Objection_ ") prior to the expiration of the Sellers Review Period, then the
Post-Closing Purchaser Report shall be final and binding upon the parties and
shall be deemed the " _Final Purchaser Report,_ " and the components thereof
shall be deemed the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Calculation Report"
Sellers may only object to the Post-Closing Purchaser Report on the basis of
(i) mathematical error, (ii) such Post-Closing Purchaser Report not being
calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet Methods or the Calculation
Report Methods, as applicable, or (iii) such Post-Closing Purchaser Report not
be calculated in a manner consistent with the Final Settlement Report. If
Sellers, in compliance with the preceding sentence, deliver a Sellers
Statement of Objection prior to the expiration of the Sellers Review Period,
then Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to amicably resolve any such
objection within twenty (20) days following receipt by Purchaser of the
Sellers Statement of Objection. 

(c) If any such objections are resolved in writing by Sellers and Purchaser,
then such resolutions shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall
be incorporated into the Final Purchaser Report. If any such objections are
not resolved in writing within twenty (20) days following receipt by Purchaser
of the Sellers Statement of Objection, then Sellers and Purchaser
shall submit any such objections which remain unresolved to the Independent
Accountant.

(d) Within ten (10) days of the appointment of the Independent Accountant,
(i) Purchaser shall provide the Independent Accountant with a copy of the
Post-Closing Purchaser Report (as modified by any adjustments agreed to in
writing by Sellers and Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.11(c)_), and (ii)
Sellers and Purchaser shall each prepare and deliver to the Independent
Accountant a written report of such line item or items identified in the
Sellers Statement of Objection remaining in dispute, which report shall set
forth the specific dollar amount proposed by such party for each such item or
items and a detailed explanation of the basis and rationale for such partys
positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the
other party. Each party shall then be given an opportunity to supplement the
information and support included in its initial submission with one additional
submission to respond to any arguments or positions taken by the other party
in such other partys initial submission, which supplemental information
shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant (with a copy thereof to the
other party) within seven (7) days after the first date on which both parties
have submitted their respective initial submissions to the Independent
Accountant.

(e) The Independent Accountant shall thereafter finally determine the manner
in which such item or items shall be treated in the Final Purchaser Report. In
making its determination, the Independent Accountant shall (i) consider only
those items that (A) are identified in the Sellers Statement of Objection
or in Sellers supplemental submissions delivered to the Independent
Accountant pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)_ as in dispute and (B) were not
resolved in writing by Sellers and Purchaser, (ii) base its determination
solely on such reports (including Sellers Statement of Objection and
supplemental reports delivered to the Independent Accountant pursuant to
_Section 2.11(d)_) submitted by Sellers and Purchaser and each of the Balance
Sheet Methods and the Calculation Report Methods (including the
methodologies, procedures, judgments, assumptions and estimates described in
the Balance Sheet Methods and

 



47  Calculation Report Methods, respectively), and not on the basis of an
independent review, (iii) not assign a value to any item (A) greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Sellers in the Sellers
Statement of Objection, Purchaser in the Post-Closing Purchaser Report or
either Sellers or Purchaser in their respective reports or supplemental
materials delivered to the Independent Accountant pursuant to  _Section
2.11(d)_ or (B) less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Sellers in the Sellers Statement of Objection, Purchaser in the Post-Closing
Purchaser Report or either Sellers or Purchaser in their respective reports
or supplemental materials delivered to the Independent Accountant pursuant to
_Section 2.11(d)_ and (iv) barring exceptional circumstances, make its
written determination within thirty (30) days of its appointment ( _provided_
that the failure of the Independent Accountant to make its written
determination in such thirty (30) day period shall not be grounds to defend
against or object to the enforcement of such written determination).

 

(f) Sellers and Purchaser agree to each enter into a customary engagement
letter with the Independent Accountant for purposes of any dispute pursuant
to this _Section 2.11_. Sellers and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with
the Independent Accountant and shall provide, upon the reasonable request of
the Independent Accountant, any non-privileged information and documentation,
including any accountants work papers or internal accounting records or
reserving papers, files and models, and make reasonably available to the
Independent Accountant personnel of Sellers and their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company), on the
other hand, in each case that have been involved in the preparation of the
Post-Closing Purchaser Report or the Sellers Statement of Objection, as
applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the independent accountants of
each of Sellers and Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent
Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent accountants. Any such information and
documentation provided by Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the
other hand, to the Independent Accountant shall concurrently be provided to
the other parties in the dispute to the extent not already so provided;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of Sellers
and Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to any
party unless and until such party has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the applicable independent accountant.
Neither Sellers, on the one hand, nor Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
disclose to the Independent Accountant, and the Independent Accountant shall
not consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer
made by any party to the dispute with respect to any objection under this
_Section 2.11_ unless otherwise agreed in writing by the other parties to the
dispute.

 

(g) The written determination by the Independent Accountant shall, absent
fraud or manifest error, be final and binding upon the parties to this
Agreement, subject to _Section 2.12_ and _Section 2.13_, and judgment
thereon may be entered or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
written determination shall not be subject to review by a court or
other tribunal, and the Post-Closing Purchaser Report, as adjusted to reflect
any adjustments made by the Independent Accountant, shall be deemed the "
_Final Purchaser Report_ ," and the components thereof shall be deemed the
Final Balance Sheet and the Final Calculation Report, respectively. The fees,
costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by
each party to the dispute in proportion to the matters resolved against it, as
determined by the 

 



48  Independent Accountant in its written determination. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accountant shall act as an expert, not as an
arbitrator, and the determination of the Independent Accountant and the
agreement contained in this _Section 2.11_ to submit to the determination of
the Independent Accountant shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with Article 76 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
determination of the Final Purchaser Report pursuant to this _Section 2.11_,
Sellers and Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the Final Purchaser Report
to Reinsurer. Within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of the Final
Purchaser Report, Reinsurer shall deliver to Sellers and Purchaser a report
setting forth an allocation of the Final Aggregate Ceding Commission between
the Ceding Commission (the " _Final Ceding Commission_ ") and the New York
Ceding Commission (the " _Final New York Ceding Commission_ ").

 

(h) No later than (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchaser Report pursuant to this _Section 2.11_:

 

(i) if the Purchase Price determined by reference to the Final Purchaser
Report is greater than the Closing Payment, then Purchaser shall pay (A) to
LMIC an amount in cash equal to ninety percent (90%) of such excess _plus_
ninety percent (90%) of the interest on such excess from the Closing Date to
the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate and (B) to LMFIC an amount
in cash equal to ten percent (10%) of such excess _plus_ ten percent (10%) of
the interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment
accrued at the Interest Rate;

 

(ii) if the Purchase Price determined by reference to the Final Balance Sheet
is less than the Closing Payment, then (A) LMIC shall pay to Purchaser ninety
percent (90%) of such shortfall _plus_ ninety percent (90%) of the interest on
such shortfall from the Closing Date to the date of payment accrued at the
Interest Rate and (B) LMFIC shall pay to Purchaser ten percent (10%) of such
shortfall _plus_ ten percent (10%) of the interest on such shortfall from the
Closing Date to the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate;

 

(iii) if the Final Ceding Commission is greater than the Estimated Ceding
Commission, then Reinsurer shall pay to the Company the amount of such excess
_plus_ interest on such excess from the Closing Date to the date of payment
accrued at the Interest Rate;

 

(iv) if the Final Ceding Commission is less than the Estimated Ceding
Commission, then Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay to Reinsurer the
amount of such shortfall _plus_ interest on such shortfall from the Closing
Date to the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate;

 

(v) if the Final New York Ceding Commission is greater than the Estimated New
York Ceding Commission, then New York Reinsurer shall pay to the Company the
amount of such excess _plus_ interest on such excess from the Closing Date to
the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate; and

 



49 (vi) if the Final New York Ceding Commission is less than the Estimated New
York Ceding Commission, then Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay to New
York Reinsurer the amount of such shortfall _plus_ interest on such shortfall
from the Closing Date to the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate.

 

(i) All cash required to be transferred pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ shall
be transferred by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by the recipient of the applicable payment,
unless otherwise specified herein.

 

Section 2.12 _Post-Closing Net Settlement Adjustment_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Reinsurer and Sellers, on or before
the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date a statement (the "
_Post-Closing Settlement Report_ ") setting forth (i) a statement of net
settlement walk for the Life Business as of the Balance Sheet Date (the "
_Post-Closing Statement of Net Settlement Walk_ ") prepared in accordance
with the Statement of Net Settlement Methods and in the same format as the
Reference Settlements Walk, and (ii) the Book Value and Fair Market Value of
the Transferred Life Assets as of the Balance Sheet Date (the " _Post-Closing
Asset Report_ ").

(b) Following receipt of the Post-Closing Settlement Report, each of
Reinsurer, Sellers and Purchaser shall have sixty (60) days (the "
_Settlement Review Period_ ") to review such Post-Closing Settlement Report.
In connection with the review of the Post-Closing Settlement Report, Purchaser
shall cause the Company to provide Reinsurer and its Representatives and
Sellers and their Representatives, upon the request of Reinsurer or Sellers,
as applicable, reasonable access to the Life Books and Records, with respect
to the period up to and including the Closing Date (including any such
applicable Life Books and Records created after the Closing Date to the extent
relating to the period up to and including the Closing Date), including any
accountants work papers or internal accounting records or reserving papers,
in each case to the extent relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing
Settlement Report ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants
of Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any work papers available to
Reinsurer or Sellers unless and until Reinsurer and Sellers, as applicable,
has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to
such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants), and Purchaser shall make reasonably available to
Reinsurer and its Representatives and Sellers and their Representatives
personnel of Purchaser and their Affiliates that were involved in the
preparation of the Post-Closing Settlement Report. If Reinsurer and Sellers,
in compliance with the preceding sentence, have accepted the Post-Closing
Settlement Report in writing or have not given written notice to Purchaser
setting forth any objection to the Post-Closing Settlement Report (a "
_Reinsurance Statement of Objection_ ") prior to the expiration of the
Settlement Review Period, and Purchaser has not proposed in writing any
changes to the Post-Closing Settlement Report, then the Post-
Closing Settlement Report shall be final and binding upon the parties and
shall be deemed the " _Final Settlement Report_ " (including the Final
Statement of Net Settlement Walk and the Final Asset Report). Each of
Reinsurer and Sellers may only object to the Post-Closing Statement of Net
Settlement Walk or the Post-Closing Asset Report (i) in the case of the
former, on the basis of (A) mathematical error or (B) the Post-Closing
Statement of Net Settlement Walk not being calculated in accordance with the
Statement of Net Settlement Methods and (ii) in the case of the latter, (A) on
the basis of mathematical error or (B) the Post-

 



50  Closing Asset Report not being determined in accordance with the definition
of Book Value and the Fair Market Value Methods, respectively. If Reinsurer or
Sellers, in compliance with the preceding sentence, delivers a Reinsurance
Statement of Objection prior to the expiration of the Settlement Review
Period, or Purchaser proposes any changes to the Post-Closing Settlement
Report, then the parties shall attempt to amicably resolve any such objection
within twenty (20) days following the later to occur of Purchasers receipt of
the Reinsurance Statement of Objection (if any) and Sellers and Reinsurers
receipt of Purchasers written proposal of changes (if any) to the Post-
Closing Settlement Report. If any such objections or proposed changes raised
pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ are resolved in writing by the parties, then
such resolutions shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be
incorporated into the Final Settlement Report. If any such objections or
proposed changes raised pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_ or this _Section
2.12(b)_ are not resolved within the twenty (20) day period specified in this
_Section 2.12(b)_, then the parties shall submit any such objections or
proposed changes which remain unresolved to the Independent Accountant.

 

(c) Within ten (10) days of the appointment of the Independent Accountant, (i)
Purchaser shall provide the Independent Accountant with a copy of (A) the
Methodologies, (B) the Post-Closing Settlement Report (as modified by any

2.12(b)_) and (C) a written proposal of any changes to the Post-Closing
Settlement Report raised by Purchaser during the Settlement Review Period (to
the extent not already agreed and reflected in clause _(B)_ of this _Section
2.12(c)_) and (ii) each of the parties shall prepare and deliver to the
Independent Accountant a written report of matters raised pursuant to _Section
2.12(b)_ that remain in dispute, which report shall set forth the specific
dollar amount proposed by such party for each such disputed matter and a
detailed explanation of the basis and rationale for such partys positions,
and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the other parties.
Each party shall then be given an opportunity to supplement the information
and support included in its initial submission to the Independent Accountant
with one additional submission to respond to any arguments or positions taken
by the other parties in their respective initial submissions, which
supplemental information and support shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountant (with a copy thereof to the other parties) within seven (7) days
after the first date on which all parties have submitted their respective
initial submissions to the Independent Accountant.

 

(d) The Independent Accountant shall thereafter finally determine the manner
in which such item or items shall be treated in the Final Settlement Report.
In making its determination, the Independent Accountant shall (i) consider
only those items that (A) are identified in any Reinsurance Statement of
Objection or in in any submission or supplemental submissions delivered to
the Independent Accountant pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)_ as in dispute and
(B) were not resolved in writing by the parties, (ii) base its determination
solely on (I) such materials delivered to the Independent Accountant in
accordance with _Section 2.12(c)_ and not on the basis of other materials and
(II) the applicable Methodologies (including the methodologies, procedures,
judgments, assumptions and estimates described therein), and not on the basis
of any independent methodology, (iii) not assign a value to any item (A)
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by a party in such
materials delivered to the Independent Accountant in accordance with _Section
2.12(c)_ or (B) less than the smallest value for such item claimed by a party
in such materials delivered to the Independent Accountant in accordance with
_Section 2.12(c)_ and (iv) barring exceptional circumstances, make
its determination within thirty (30) days of its appointment ( _provided_
that the failure of the Independent Accountant to make its written
determination in such thirty (30) day period shall not be grounds to defend
against or object to the enforcement of such written determination).

 



51 (e) The parties agree to each enter into a customary engagement letter with
the Independent Accountant. The parties shall reasonably cooperate with the
Independent Accountant and shall provide, upon the reasonable request of the
Independent Accountant, any non-privileged information and documentation,
including any accountants work papers or internal accounting records or
reserving papers, files and models, and make reasonably available to the
Independent Accountant personnel of such party that have been substantively
involved in the matters in disputes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
independent accountants of each of the parties shall not be obligated to make
any work papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the
Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. Any such
information and documentation provided by a party to the Independent
Accountant shall concurrently be provided to the other parties in the dispute
to the extent not already so provided; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants of parties shall not be obligated to make any work
papers available to any party unless and until such party has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the applicable
independent accountant. No party shall disclose to the Independent
Accountant, and the Independent Accountant shall not consider for any purpose,
any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party to the
dispute with respect to any objection under this _Section 2.12_
unless otherwise agreed in writing by the other parties to the dispute.

(f) The written determination by the Independent Accountant shall,
absent fraud or manifest error, and subject to _Section 2.13_, be final and
binding upon the parties to this Agreement and judgment thereon may be entered
or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The written determination
shall not be subject to review by a court or other tribunal, and the Post-
Closing Settlement Report, as adjusted to reflect any adjustments made by the
Independent Accountant, shall be deemed the " _Final Settlement Report_ ". The
fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by each party to the dispute in proportion to the matters resolved
against it, as determined by the Independent Accountant in its written
determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall
act as an expert, not as an arbitrator, and the determination of the
Independent Accountant and the agreement contained in this _Section 2.12_ to
submit to the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with Article 76 of the New York Civil Practice
Law and Rules.

(g) No later than five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Settlement Report pursuant to this _Section 2.12_, if: (i) the Closing
Reconciliation Amount determined by reference to the Final Settlement Report
(the " _Final Reconciliation Amount_ ") _minus_ the Closing Reconciliation
Amount is a negative amount, then Purchaser shall cause the Company to
transfer cash to Reinsurer in an amount equal to the absolute value of such
difference _plus_  interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date
of payment accrued at the Interest Rate, or (ii) if the Final Reconciliation
Amount less Closing Reconciliation Amount is a positive amount, then the
Reinsurer shall pay to the Company cash in an amount equal to such excess
_plus_ interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment
accrued at the Interest Rate.

 



52 (h) All cash required to be transferred pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall
be transferred by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the recipient of the applicable payment.

 

Section 2.13 _Inconsistencies_.

 

(a) Each party acknowledges and agrees that the intent of this _Article II_
is for the Final Settlement Report and the Final Purchaser Report to be
finally determined in a consistent manner, resolving or otherwise eliminating
the impact of any inconsistency between the Final Settlement Report and the
Final Purchaser Report. In furtherance of the foregoing if, within thirty
(30) days following the determination of the Final Purchaser Report, any party
identifies any such inconsistency between the Final Settlement Report and the
Final Purchaser Report, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to seek
to rectify such inconsistency and to restore each party as closely as
reasonably possible to the positions that it would have occupied had no
inconsistency existed between the Final Settlement Report and the Final
Purchaser Report. If the parties are unable to agree on the resolution of any
such inconsistency, such dispute (solely to the extent relating to such
inconsistency) shall be referred to the Independent Accountant (and the
provisions of _Sections 2.12(c)_ and the last two sentences of _Section
2.12(d)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ ).

(b) Within ten (10) days of the appointment of the Independent Accountant,
(i) the parties shall provide the Independent Accountant with a copy of (A)
the Methodologies, (B) the Final Settlement Report and (C) the Final Purchaser
Report and (ii) each of the parties shall prepare and deliver to the
Independent Accountant a written report of the inconsistencies raised pursuant
to _Section 2.13(a)_ that remain in dispute, which report shall set forth the
specific dollar amount proposed by such party for each such disputed matter
and a detailed explanation of the basis and rationale for such partys
positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the
other parties.

 

(c) The Independent Accountant shall thereafter finally determine the manner
in which such inconsistency shall be treated across the Final Settlement
Report and the Final Purchaser Report. In making its determination, the
Independent Accountant shall (i) consider only those items that (A) are
identified in the submissions delivered to the Independent Accountant pursuant
to  _Section 2.13(b)_, (ii) base its determination solely on (A) such
materials delivered to it in accordance with _Section 2.13(b)_ and not on the
basis of other materials and (B) the applicable Methodologies (including the
methodologies, procedures, judgments, assumptions and estimates described
therein), and not on the basis of any independent methodology, (iii) not
assign a value to any item (A) greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by a party in such materials delivered to the Independent
Accountant in accordance with _Section 2.13(b)_ or (B) less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by a party in such materials delivered to the
Independent Accountant in accordance with _Section 2.13(b)_ and (iv) barring
exceptional circumstances, make its determination within thirty (30) days of
its appointment (provided that the failure of the Independent Accountant to
make its written determination in such thirty (30) day period shall not be
grounds to defend against or object to the enforcement of such written
determination).

 



53 (d) The written determination by the Independent Accountant shall, absent
fraud or manifest error, be final and binding upon the parties to this
Agreement and judgment thereon may be entered or enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The written determination shall not be subject to
review by a court or other tribunal, and the Final Settlement Report and the
Final Purchaser Report, as adjusted to reflect any adjustments made by the
Independent Accountant, shall be deemed the new " _Final Settlement Report_ "
and " _Final Purchaser Report_."

 

(e) The parties shall settle any amounts so as to give effect to the
determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this  _Section 2.13_
within five (5) Business Days of the date of delivery of the Independent
Accountants determination.

 

(f) All cash required to be transferred pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ shall
be transferred by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the recipient of the applicable payment.

Section 2.14  _Section 338(h)(10) Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Schedule 2.14(a)_ hereto sets forth a hypothetical calculation of
the Tax benefits and detriments to the parties of the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, assuming that the Closing occurred on December 31, 2016. Within
thirty (30) days following the date hereof, Sellers and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to determine
the appropriate methodology for calculating the amounts set forth in items 4
(the " _FMV Basis_ ") and 18 and 22 (" _Sellers  Detriment_") of
_Schedule 2.14(a)_ (together, the FMV Basis and Sellers Detriment, the "
_Disputed Items_ "). If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement
regarding the appropriate methodology for calculating either or both of the
Disputed Items within such thirty (30) day period, then Sellers and Purchaser
shall submit any such remaining Disputed Item(s) (the " _Remaining Disputed
Items_ ") for resolution to the Independent Accountant, who shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and, in any case, no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date), prepare and deliver to Sellers and Purchaser
an updated draft of _Schedule 2.14(a)_ , which updated draft (the "
_Independent Section 338(h)(10) Calculation_") shall (i) incorporate,
without modifying in any respect, (A) the values set forth in _Schedule
2.14(a)_ other than the Disputed Items (the " _Agreed Items_ ") and (B) any
Disputed Items with respect to which the parties were able to determine and
agree on the appropriate methodology for calculating such Disputed Items
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence (in each case, other than with
respect to "sum," "net," "total" or other similar amounts the calculation of
which is dependent on the determination of the Remaining Disputed Items, which
amounts shall be modified to reflect the resolution of the Remaining Disputed
Items pursuant to this _Section 2.14_), and (ii) reflect the Independent
Accountants determination of the appropriate methodology for calculating the
Remaining Disputed Items; provided, however, that with respect to Sellers
Detriment, the Independent Accountant must choose either the methodology that
reflects Purchasers position or the methodology that reflects Sellers
position, in each case, as set forth on _Schedule 2.14(a)_. In determining
the appropriate methodology for calculating such Remaining Disputed Items for
purposes of the Independent Section 338(h)(10) Calculation, the Independent
Accountant (i) shall consult with Sellers and Purchaser (and their 

 



54  respective representatives) regarding each partys positions with respect to
the Disputed Items and (ii) may consult a nationally-recognized law firm that
is not the counsel of any of the parties, and is otherwise independent and
impartial, regarding legal issues relevant to such determination with respect
to which the Independent Accountant is unable or unwilling to provide advice
(the " _Section 338(h)(10) Law Firm_ "). As promptly as reasonably
practicable upon resolution by the parties of the Disputed Items within the
thirty (30) day period following the date hereof, or upon the receipt of the
Independent Section 338(h)(10) Calculation, as applicable, Sellers shall
update such calculation, using the same methodologies used in such resolution
or the Independent Section 338(h)(10) Calculation, as applicable, based on an
assumption that the Closing will occur on the Closing Date then reasonably
anticipated by the parties, rather than an assumed Closing Date of December
31, 2016 (" _Sellers  Section 338(h)(10) Calculation_"). To the extent that
the Tax benefits to the parties of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, as set
forth in Sellers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation (the " _Estimated Section
338(h)(10) Elections Benefit_") exceed the sum of (A) the Tax detriments to
the parties of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, as set forth in Sellers
Section 338(h)(10) Calculation, the " _Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Elections
Cost_") plus (B) Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Elections Amount, any such
excess shall be hereinafter referred to as the " _Estimated Section
338(h)(10) Elections Excess_."

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days after the resolution of all disputes
(if any), raised pursuant to Section 2.13, Purchaser shall update Sellers
Section 338(h)(10) Calculation to take into account the adjusted Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to the foregoing Sections of this
_Article II_, which calculation (" _Purchaser s Section 338(h)(10)
Calculation_") shall use the same methodologies used to determine the
Sellers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation; provided, however, that the value of
(but not the method of calculating) the items set forth on Sellers Section
338(h)(10) Calculation (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Elections Amount) may be updated from that
shown on Sellers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation (i) in order to take into
account the adjusted Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to the
foregoing Sections of this _Article II_ or (ii) to reflect any reasonable
disagreement with any amount on the Sellers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation.
If Sellers reasonably disagree with any amount on the Purchasers Section
338(h)(10) Calculation (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchasers
Section 338(h)(10) Elections Amount), Sellers shall notify Purchaser in
writing of such disagreement as promptly as reasonably practicable
after Sellers receipt of Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation) (and,
in any event, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Purchasers Section
338(h)(10) Calculation). If a notice of objection shall be so delivered,
Sellers and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed amounts. If Sellers and Purchaser
are unable to resolve any disputed amounts within ten (10) days after
receipt by Purchaser of such timely notice of objection, then Sellers and
Purchaser shall submit such disputed amounts for resolution to the Independent
Accountant, whose determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Sellers and Purchaser for purposes of this _Section 2.14_ and, to the extent
relevant, _Section 10.14_. The Independent Accountants resolution of any
such dispute shall (i) incorporate the same methodologies used, with respect
to the Agreed Items, in _Schedule 2.14(a)_ and, with respect to the Disputed
Items, in the resolution by the parties of the Disputed Items within the
thirty (30) day period following the date hereof or in the Independent Section
338(h)(10) Calculation, as applicable, with the values updated only to take
into account the adjusted Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to the
foregoing Sections of this Article II, and (ii) in no event be delivered to
Sellers and Purchaser more than thirty (30) days after the referral of

 



55  such dispute to the Independent Accountant. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Sellers.
The " _Final Section 338(h)(10) Calculation_" shall be (i) the Purchasers
Section 338(h)(10) Calculation if the Sellers do not notify Purchaser of any
disagreement with any item thereon, (ii) if such a notice of objection is
delivered by Sellers, the Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Calculation as
updated to reflect the agreed resolution among the parties of such dispute, or
(iii) if the parties do not so agree, the Independent Accountants resolution
of such dispute as described above. To the extent that the Final Section
338(h)(10) Elections Benefit exceeds the sum of (A) the Final Section
338(h)(10) Elections Cost plus (B) Purchasers Section 338(h)(10) Elections
Amount, any such excess shall be hereinafter referred to as the " _Final
Section 338(h)(10) Elections Excess_."

(c) No later than two (2) Business Days after the delivery of the calculation
described in _Section 2.14(b)_:

(i) if the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Elections Adjustment Amount is less
than the Final Section 338(h)(10) Elections Adjustment Amount, then Purchaser
shall pay (A) to LMIC an amount in cash equal to ninety percent (90%) of
such shortfall plus ninety percent (90%) of the interest on such shortfall
from the Closing Date to the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate and
(B) to LMFIC an amount in cash equal to ten percent (10%) of such shortfall
plus ten percent (10%) of the interest on such shortfall from the Closing
Date to the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate; and

 

(ii) if the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Elections Adjustment Amount is
greater than the Final Section 338(h)(10) Elections Adjustment Amount, then
(A) LMIC shall pay to Purchaser ninety percent (90%) of such excess plus
ninety percent (90%) of the interest on such excess from the Closing Date to
the date of payment accrued at the Interest Rate and (B) LMFIC shall pay to
Purchaser ten percent (10%) of such excess plus ten percent (10%) of the
interest on such excess from the Closing Date to the date of payment accrued
at the Interest Rate.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the determinations of the
Independent Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ shall, absent fraud
or manifest error, be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
_Section 2.14_ and, to the extent relevant, _Section 10.14_. No party may
initiate a dispute with respect to the matters contemplated by this _Section
2.14_ pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, including any other
Section of this _Article II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
(i) the failure of the Independent Accountant to deliver the Independent
Section 338(h)(10) Calculation within the time period provided in _Section
2.14(a)_ shall not be grounds to defend against or object to the enforcement
of such calculation and (ii) the determination of the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections Benefit and the Section 338(h)(10) Elections Cost shall be made by
reference to (A) the Agreed Items as set forth on _Schedule 2.14(a)_ and (B)
the Disputed Items as resolved by the parties within thirty (30) days after
the date hereof or by the Independent Accountant and set forth in the
Independent Section 338(h)(10) Calculation, in each case adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.14(b)_, as applicable, and in no event shall any Agreed Item
(including any such amount as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.14(b)_, as
applicable) be subject to any dispute among the parties or any modification by
the Independent Accountant in preparing the Independent Section 338(h)(10)
Calculation (absent manifest error). The fees of the Independent Accountant
and the Section 338(h)(10) Law Firm (as applicable) with respect to the
calculations described in this _Section 2.14_ shall be borne equally by
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.

 



56 Section 2.15 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, each of the Transferred Companies, Purchaser and Reinsurer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from payments made pursuant to this Agreement
and any Ancillary Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld
under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Transferred
Company, Purchaser or Reinsurer intends to withhold any amount from any
payment made pursuant to this Agreement, the relevant Transferred Company,
Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, shall provide any Person with respect
to which such withholding is intended with written notice as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to
making any payment pursuant to this Agreement to such Person with respect to
which the relevant Transferred Company, Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable,
believes withholding is required pursuant to this _Section 2.15_, and shall
afford such Person the opportunity to provide such Tax forms or
other documentation that would eliminate or reduce the amount to be so
withheld. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and timely
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. The parties shall
provide to each other any statements, forms or other documents reasonably
requested by another party with respect to the withholding of Taxes
(including an IRS Form W-9 or other applicable form).

Section 5.15 _Reinsurance_. Section 5.15 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule

Agreement, of each Life Reinsurance Contract. True, correct and complete
copies of each Life Reinsurance Contract (including, in each case, all
amendments and addenda thereto) have been Made Available to Reinsurer.
Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other party
or parties thereto, as of the date of this Agreement, (a) each Life
Reinsurance Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, each other party or parties thereto, in accordance
with its terms and is in full force and effect, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions, (b) the Company is not and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no other
party thereto is (or, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
will be) in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
obligation, covenant or condition contained in any Life Reinsurance Contract
and (c) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, the passage of

and (c), where such failures to be valid and binding and in full force and

reasonably be expected to be material to the Life Business, taken as a whole.
To the Knowledge of Sellers, no other party to any Life Reinsurance Contract
is the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship,
receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. No Life Reinsurance Contract
contains triggers that would allow the counterparty to terminate such Life
Reinsurance Contract based on a ratings downgrade of the Company below certain
minimum ratings issued by a credit rating agency or a reduction in the
Companys capital and surplus below a certain level. As of the date hereof,
no party to any Life Reinsurance Contract has given written notice of

 



85  termination (provisional or otherwise) under any Life Reinsurance Contract.
From December 31, 2016 to the date hereof, (i) Sellers and their Affiliates
have not received any written or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, oral notice of
any actual or proposed increase in the rate payable under any Reinsurance
Contract, and (ii) no such increase has occurred.

 

Section 5.16 _Policy Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Sellers and the Company monitor the Reinsured Contracts for compliance
with their intended Tax treatment under the Code, including monitoring the
Reinsured Contracts for treatment as "modified endowment contracts," and the
Reinsured Contracts satisfy the applicable requirements for such Tax treatment
in all material respects. All of the Reinsured Contracts are subject to
Section 848(a) and 848(c)(1)(C) of the Code. For purposes of this _Section
5.16_, the provisions of applicable Law relating to Tax treatment of the
Reinsured Contracts shall include, but not be limited to, Sections 72, 101,
817, 7702, 7702A and 7702B of the Code.

(b) Sellers and the Company have complied in all material respects with all
Tax reporting, withholding, and disclosure requirements that are applicable
to the Reinsured Contracts and have reported, in all material respects, all
distributions under such Reinsured Contracts in accordance with all applicable
requirements of the Code, Treasury Regulations and forms issued by the IRS.

(c) Each Reinsured Contract provides, and since the date of issuance,
assumption, exchange, modification or purchase of such Reinsured Contract has
provided, the purchaser, policyholder, account holder, other holder or
intended beneficiary thereof with Tax treatment under the Code that is, in all
material respects, the same as or more favorable than the Tax treatment (i)
that was purported to apply in materials provided at the time of issuance,
assumption, exchange, modification or purchase or (ii) for which such policies
or contracts were intended or reasonably expected to qualify under the Code
at the time of issuance, assumption, exchange, modification or purchase. Each
Reinsured Contract that is subject to Section 7702 of the Code satisfies in
all material respects the requirements of Section 7702(a) of the Code
and otherwise qualifies as a "life insurance contract" for purposes of the
Code.

(d) No Reinsured Contract constitutes a "modified endowment contract" within
the meaning of Section 7702A of the Code. The Company has received signed
acknowledgments substantially in the form of the acknowledgment that was Made
Available in subfolder 10.243 of the folder "Providence Individual" of the
Electronic Data Room from the applicable policyholder of each Reinsured
Contract of the type described on Section 4.19(d) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule (other than the "Inadvertent MECs" as defined therein).

(e) The Company is treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as the owner
of the assets underlying the Reinsured Contracts.

(f) None of the Sellers or the Company are parties to any "hold harmless," Tax
sharing or indemnification agreements regarding the Tax qualification or the
Tax treatment of the Reinsured Contracts (whether developed by, administered
by, or reinsured with any unrelated third party).

 



86 (g) There is no currently pending (i) U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign
audit or other administrative proceeding by any Taxing Authority or (ii)
judicial proceeding, in either case against Sellers or the Company or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, against any other party, regarding material Taxes with
respect to the Tax treatment of any Reinsured Contract. None of Sellers or
the Company has requested or is subject to a ruling or waiver with respect to
any material potential or actual failure of any Reinsured Contract to meet any
applicable requirements of the Code or any Treasury Regulations or
administrative guidance issued thereunder that would have continuing effect or
be binding for periods (or portions thereof) ending after the Balance Sheet
Date. None of Sellers or the Company have entered into any
material settlement agreement, closing agreement or other agreement with any
Taxing Authority with respect to any potential or actual failure of any
Reinsured Contract to meet any applicable requirements of the Code or any
Treasury Regulations or administrative guidance issued thereunder which
agreement would have continuing effect or be binding for periods (or portions
thereof) ending after the Balance Sheet Date, and none of Sellers or the
Company are currently involved in any discussions or negotiations with any
Taxing Authority regarding any such agreement or request.

(h) None of Sellers or the Company have requested relief from any Taxing
Authority concerning the qualification of any Reinsured Contract under the
Code, and no Taxing Authority has asserted in writing to Sellers or the
Company that any Reinsured Contract fails to so qualify.

 

(i) Each "segregated asset account," within the meaning of Section 817(h) of
the Code, maintained by the Company with respect to the Reinsured Contracts
meets, and since the establishment of such account has met, the
diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and otherwise satisfies in all
material respects the requirements of the Code, the Treasury Regulations, and
administrative guidance issued thereunder.

(j) Each holder of a BOLI/COLI Contract (other than Excluded BOLI/COLI
Contracts) (i) had, at the time of issuance of such BOLI/COLI Contract, a
valid insurable interest under applicable Law in each insured life under such
BOLI/COLI Contract and (ii) to the Knowledge of Sellers, has a valid
insurable interest under applicable Law in each insured life under such
BOLI/COLI Contract.

(k) Notwithstanding any other representation or warranty in this Agreement to
the contrary, the representations and warranties in this _Section 5.16_ and,
solely to the extent relating to Taxes, _Section 5.07_ and  _Section
5.20_(d) constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
Sellers to Reinsurer with respect to Taxes.

 

Section 5.17 _Life Investment Assets_. Section 5.17(a) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all
Investment Assets (other than Investment Assets held in the Life Separate
Accounts or, for the avoidance of doubt, the COLI Investment Assets) held in
respect of the Reinsured Contracts as at January 11, 2018 (except
with respect to the Specified Investment Assets, which are as at December 31,
2017). The Company, or a trustee acting on the Companys behalf, has good and
valid title to all such Life Investment Assets it purports to own, free and

2015, the Company has managed the Investment Assets then held by the Company

(including all renewals and intent-to-use applications thereof) and (iii)
copyright registrations and applications, in each case owned by Sellers or
their Affiliates that are included in the Transferred Life Intellectual
Property. Sellers and their Affiliates are the exclusive and, if applicable,
record owners of the material Transferred Life Intellectual Property, free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. As of the Closing

listed on Section 5.18(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and all other
material Transferred Life Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable.

(b) To the Knowledge of Sellers, the conduct of the Life Business as currently
conducted does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, breach or otherwise

June 30, 2015, no Person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise
violated, or is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating, any of the Transferred Life Intellectual Property. No such claims
are pending or threatened in writing against any Person by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates.

 

(c) Sellers and their Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) have
taken all actions reasonably necessary to maintain the enforceability of the
material Transferred Life Intellectual Property (including (i) making and

that is, the subject of a registration or pending application and (ii)
maintaining the secrecy of all material confidential Intellectual Property
used in the Life Business).

publicly distributed policies and any contractual requirements, including
applicable terms of use and external-facing privacy policies, pertaining to
the protection, privacy, security, collection, storage, use, disclosure,
disposal, maintenance and transmission of Personal Information. To the
Knowledge of Sellers, since June 30, 2015, none of Sellers and their
Affiliates, or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, any third Person working on
behalf of any of them, has experienced an incident of unauthorized access,
disclosure, use, destruction or loss of any Personal Information that Sellers
or their Affiliates (or a third Person on behalf of any of them) collects,
stores, uses or transmits in the conduct of the Life Business that by Law
required the delivery of notice to affected individuals pursuant to Laws
pertaining to privacy and data security.

 



88 (b) Since June 30, 2015, there have been no disruptions or defects in the
information technology systems used in the Life Business that materially
adversely affected the operations of the Life Business other than disruptions
or defects which have been repaired or resolved. To the Knowledge of Sellers,
none of any information technology systems included in the Acquired Life
Assets contain any viruses, back doors, trap doors, Trojan horses and other
malicious or destructive code or software routines that may, or may be used
to, permit unauthorized access to software, hardware or data related to the
Life Business, or modify, delete, damage, disable, erase, interrupt, interfere
with or otherwise harm the same, or that would reasonably be expected to
interfere with the ability of Purchaser or Reinsurer to conduct the Life
Business. Sellers and their Affiliates have implemented, maintain, and comply
with commercially reasonable business continuity and backup and disaster
recovery plans and procedures with respect to the information technology
systems owned by Sellers or their Affiliates and used in the Life Business
and direct third parties operating information technology systems that are

procedures with respect to such systems.

Section 5.20 _Life Plans_.

 

(a) Section 5.20(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule contains a true,
complete and correct list of all material Life Plans. With respect to each
such Life Plan, Sellers have provided or Made Available to Reinsurer (where
applicable) true, complete and correct copies of all material plan documents
or summary plan descriptions, and any material amendments and modifications
related thereto.

(b) Each Life Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
except as set forth in Section 5.20(b) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule,
there are no existing circumstances or events that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Life Plan.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

Life Plan has been operated in compliance with the terms of such Life Plan
and applicable Law, (ii) all contributions required to be made to any Life

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due).

 



89 (d) Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the

with any other event) (i) entitle any Life Employee to any severance pay or
any other cash payment from Sellers or their Affiliates or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting of benefits or increase the amount of other
compensation due to any Life Employee. No Life Plan provides for, and neither
Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries otherwise has any obligation to
provide, a gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or
4999 of the Code. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not cause any amounts payable under the Life Plans to fail to
be deductible for U.S. federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G
of the Code.

(e) No Life Plan provides medical, dental or life insurance coverage or any
other welfare benefits after termination of employment, other than coverage

") hereby covenant and agree, each on behalf of itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, that from and following the Closing, the Receiving Party and its
Affiliates will not disclose, give, sell, use or otherwise divulge any
Confidential Information of the other party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") or
permit their respective Representatives to do the same, except that each
Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information or
portions thereof (i) if legally compelled to do so, (ii) to the extent
necessary for the performance of such Receiving Partys obligations under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (iii) to the extent necessary for the
enforcement of the rights of such Receiving Party and its Affiliates under
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (iv) to those of such Receiving
Partys Affiliates, and to their respective Representatives in each case who
need to know such information for the foregoing purposes or (v) as required
under any applicable Law. If the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, or any of
their respective Representatives become legally compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing
Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing
Party may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with
this _Section 8.02(c)_. In the event that such protective order or other
remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, as applicable,
shall furnish only that portion of Confidential Information which is legally
required to be provided and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain assurances that appropriate confidential treatment will be accorded
Confidential Information. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
subject to _Section 8.02(f)_, following the Closing, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall be deemed "Receiving Parties" with respect to information

exclusively relating to the Accident and Health Individual Policies or
the Excluded BOLI/COLI Contracts) regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d) Purchaser, Reinsurer and Sellers agree that the Confidentiality
Agreements will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
until the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent of any conflict
between the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements and this Agreement,
the terms of this Agreement shall govern, and nothing in the Confidentiality

 



102  Agreements shall restrict, prohibit, impede or delay the ability of the
parties to exercise their respective rights or perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the use of confidential information for, and the
disclosure of any confidential information to a partys respective
Representatives without the disclosing partys consent in connection with,
the negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Prior to the Closing, (i) Sellers, Purchaser and Reinsurer shall develop
and implement a plan (the " _Books and Records Plan_ ") that will result in
(x) Sellers or a Transferred Company retaining a copy of the Books and Records
and (y) the delivery or transfer, subject to compliance with applicable Law,
of the Books and Records to Purchaser (or a Person designated by Purchaser),
and (ii) Sellers, Purchaser and Reinsurer shall develop and implement a plan
that will result in (x) Reinsurer receiving a copy of the Life Books and

in the manner (and in the case of physical Books and Records or physical
copies of the Life Books and Records at the location(s)) reasonably requested
by Purchaser or Reinsurer to the extent not located at an office of a
Transferred Company; _provided_ that Sellers shall have no obligation to
expunge any such Books and Records from Sellers or their Affiliates systems
or records or to expunge any electronic archival or backups of such Books and
Records. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to maintain the Books and Records in
substantially the same manner and with the same care that the Books and
Records have been maintained for the twelve (12)-month period prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

(f) From and after the Closing, Sellers and LMGI shall not, and shall cause
their Affiliates (and their respective captive agents) not to, use, transfer
or monetize the Books and Records (except for Books and Records exclusively
relating to any Retained Business, including relating to the Accident and
Health Individual Policies or the Excluded BOLI/COLI Contracts) or
Confidential Information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Group
Benefits Business or the Life Business for purposes of soliciting customers
or potential customers; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit any of Sellers, their Affiliates or
their respective captive agents from engaging in any general solicitation in
respect of Accident and Health Group Products or Accident and Health
Individual Policies. From and after the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates
shall be permitted to use the Books and Records solely (i) to complete
their respective legal, regulatory, Tax and financial reporting requirements,
(ii) to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements or (iii) in respect of insurance or litigation matters,
including any claims for indemnification or contribution (other than, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any litigation or dispute between Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) or Reinsurer and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates, on the other
hand); _provided_ that the foregoing sentence shall not apply to any Books and
Records exclusively relating to Accident and Health Individual Policies or the
Excluded BOLI/COLI Contracts. 

 



103 (g) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, each of

its and its Affiliates employees and Representatives for any reasonable
business purpose relating to the Transferred Businesses or the Retained
Businesses, as applicable, including in connection with Sellers pre-Closing
employment of the Transferred Business Employees or a partys preparation or
examination of regulatory and statutory filings and financial statements and
the conduct of any litigation relating to the Transferred Businesses or a
Retained Business (other than any litigation or dispute between the party
requesting, and the party requested to provide, such access to employees or
Representatives, including any claims for indemnification or contribution),
or the conduct of any regulatory authority, policyholder, reinsurer or other
dispute resolution or any other Third Party Claim. Access to such
Representatives and records shall be at the requesting partys expense, as
applicable, and shall not unreasonably interfere with the providing partys
or any of their respective successor companies business operations.

 

(h) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.02_ shall not apply with
respect to post-Closing access, cooperation, exchange of information, or
record retention in respect of Tax matters, such matters being governed by
_Section 10.07_.

(i) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, each of Purchaser,
Purchaser Parent, Reinsurer and Reinsurer Parent shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates (disregarding the proviso in the definition of

captive agents) not to, use, transfer or monetize or make available to any
Person the Books and Records or Confidential Information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries, the Group Benefits Business or the Life Business for
purposes of soliciting customers or potential customers with respect to the
sale of property and casualty insurance products (other than, with respect to
Reinsurer, solely extended service contracts, gap insurance products and
ancillary products relating to the foregoing).

104 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to _Section 8.03(c)_, each

such consent, approval or agreement shall not be deemed to result in any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or breach or non-
performance of any covenant or agreement, of Sellers contained herein for any
purpose hereunder, including for purposes of _Article X_, _Article XI_,
_Article XII_ or _Article XIII_ and (iii) such failure to obtain such

Ceding Commission, or either Purchaser or Reinsurer to any claim for
indemnification, (B) convey any rights pursuant to _Section 14.10_ to either
Purchaser or Reinsurer or (C) constitute a breach of this Agreement, including

of any Person (other than Sellers or any of their Affiliates or Purchaser or
Reinsurer, as applicable, or any of its Affiliates), and such consent has not

consent is obtained therefor and the same is sold and assigned to Purchaser
or Reinsurer, as applicable, pursuant to an assignment and assumption
agreement (or such earlier time as may be specified by Purchaser or Reinsurer,
as applicable, in writing to Sellers in the sole discretion of Purchaser or
Reinsurer) or (ii) the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing: (A) the non-
assignable items subject thereto and affected thereby shall be held, from and

to such item (including any obligation relating to Taxes); (C) Sellers shall
and shall cause their applicable Affiliate to take or cause to be taken such
actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable,
may reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable,

all intercompany loans, notes and advances regardless of their maturity and
all intercompany receivables and payables, including any accrued and unpaid
interest to but excluding the date of payment, for the amount due; _provided_
, _however_ , that this _Section 8.07(a)_ shall not apply to any
intercompany loans, notes, advances, receivables or payables (i) set forth in
Section 8.07(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) arising under any
Intercompany Agreement set forth in Section 8.07(b) or Section 8.07(c) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that the amount of any such
outstanding intercompany loan, note, advance, receivable or payable cannot be
determined by Sellers or the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates concurrently with the Closing, such intercompany loan, note,
advance, receivable or payable shall be paid in full by Sellers or the
Transferred Companies or any of their respective Affiliates (as applicable)
following the Closing within ten (10) days of receipt of an invoice detailing
the amount due with respect to such intercompany loan, note, advance,
receivable or payable.

 

(b) Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, take such actions as
may be necessary to terminate or commute, concurrently with the Closing, all
Intercompany Agreements such that, following the Closing, the Transferred
Companies shall not have any further Liability under such Intercompany
Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 8.07(b)_ shall not
apply to those Intercompany Agreements set forth on Section 8.07(b) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, take such actions as
may be necessary to amend, concurrently with the Closing, those Intercompany
Agreements set forth in Section 8.07(c) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, in
the manner set forth therein.

  



111 Section 8.08 _Guarantees_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain, on or prior to the Closing,
the termination of, and full release of Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Companies), as applicable, from any and all obligations
arising under, the guarantees, keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity or
contribution agreements, support agreements or insurance surety bonds set
forth in Section 8.08(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (each, a "
_Sellers Guaranty_ ").

 

(b) With respect to each Sellers Guaranty for which Sellers and Purchaser do
not obtain the termination of such Sellers Guaranty prior to the Closing,
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser shall, concurrently with the Closing,
enter into a hold harmless agreement with respect to each such Sellers
Guaranty in a form reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 8.08(b)_, in each case at the Closing, (i) with
respect to the guarantee set forth in Section 8.08(c)(i) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a duly executed
counterpart of the Guarantee Hold Harmless and Indemnification Agreement and
(ii) with respect to the guarantee set forth in Section 8.08(c)(ii) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Counterparties shall deliver to Sellers a
duly executed counterpart of the Counterparties Hold Harmless and
Indemnification Agreement.

 

Section 8.09 _Company Extraordinary Transactions_. Following the Closing,
Purchaser shall not (i) permit the Company to consolidate or merge with or
into any unaffiliated third party as a result of which transaction Purchaser
no longer owns at least a majority of the economic and voting power of the
Company, or (ii) sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or
indirectly, more than a majority of the economic or voting power of the
Company without Reinsurers prior written consent; _provided_ , that no such
consent shall be required in connection with a transaction pursuant
to clauses (i) or (ii) to the extent, in the case of clause (i), the
surviving company, or in the case of clause (ii), the purchaser, has a
financial strength rating issued by Standard and Poors (or a successor
thereof) of "AA-" or higher (or a comparable successor rating). For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not in any way limit the freedom of
Purchaser or Purchaser Parent to engage in any transactions relating to
economic or voting securities of Purchaser.

Section 8.10 _Transferred Investment Assets_.

 

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, Sellers shall provide
to (i) Purchaser a true, complete and correct list of all Investment Assets
(other than the COLI Investment Assets and Investment Assets held in the Life
Separate Accounts) owned by, or held in trust for the benefit of, the Company
as of the date hereof (except with respect to the Specified
Investment Assets, which are as at December 31, 2017) (the " _Company
Investment Assets_ ") and (ii) Reinsurer a true, complete and correct list of
all Investment Assets (other than Investment Assets held in the Life Separate

_Company Investment Assets_ ," the " _Transferred Investment Assets_ ").

 



112 (b) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company shall not sell,
transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Transferred Investment Assets
except (i) with respect to any Transferred Investment Asset held in a
portfolio supporting any Transferred Business, to fund cash and cash
equivalent requirements arising out of the operation of the applicable
Transferred Business, (ii) to the extent necessary to effect the Restructuring
Transactions, the transfers contemplated by _Article II_ or the substitution
of Specified Investment Assets contemplated by  _Section 8.10(f)_ below,
(iii) to manage the credit risk related to an Transferred Investment Asset to
the extent the Company or an investment advisor of the Company reasonably
determines that such Transferred Investment Asset has or may be subject to
credit-related impairments or credit-related losses in value, (iv) to comply
with any call rights, preemptive rights, rights of first offer, rights of
first refusal or similar rights, in each case pursuant to the terms of
such Transferred Investment Assets or (v) to cause the Transferred Investment
Assets to be in compliance with the requirements of the Investment Guidelines
and applicable Law.

 

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Company shall invest and
reinvest the Transferred Investment Assets in compliance with the Investment
Guidelines.

(d) The Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the end of each
calendar month (or in the case of year-end, twenty (20) Business Days) from
the date hereof until the Closing, deliver to Purchaser, (i) a list of the
Investment Assets (other than COLI Investment Assets) held by the Company,
(ii) a list of the Investment Assets (other than COLI Investment Assets) sold
or otherwise disposed of during the preceding month, the reason in clause (a)

Assets) acquired by the Company during the preceding month.

(e) The Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the end of

from the date hereof until the Closing, deliver to Reinsurer, (i) a list of
the Investment Assets held by the Company in respect of the Life Business,
(ii) a list of the Investment Assets in respect of the Life Business sold or
otherwise disposed of during the preceding month, the reason in clause (a) for
such sale or disposition, and a description of the original cost and tax
basis and (iii) a list of the Investment Assets in respect of the Life
Business acquired by the Company during the preceding month.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Investment Assets set
forth on Section 8.10(f)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Specified Investment Assets_ "), Sellers may substitute the Investment Assets
set forth on Section 8.10(f)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule at
Sellers sole option. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
reasonably cooperate and assist, at Sellers direction ( _provided_ that
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required to bear costs and expenses
to third parties in connection with such cooperations and assistance), with
respect to the re-registration or re-titling of the Specified Investment
Assets, if necessary.

(g) With respect to any Contracts related to an Transferred Investment Asset,
the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) in the case of such
Transferred Investment Assets transferred to Purchaser or Reinsurer (either
directly or to the Trust Account on Reinsurers behalf) pursuant to this
Agreement, effect mutually agreeable alternative arrangements designed

 



113  to provide Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, with substantially similar
rights and benefits that would have accrued to Purchaser or Reinsurer, as
applicable, had such consent, approval, waiver or agreement been obtained and
(ii) in the case of Transferred Investment Assets transferred to Purchaser or
Reinsurer (either directly or to the Trust Account on Reinsurers behalf)
pursuant to this Agreement, obtain all consents, approvals, waivers and
agreements necessary to assign, novate or otherwise transfer such Contracts to
Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable; _provided_ that to the extent that any
such consent, approval, waiver or agreement necessary to assign, novate or
otherwise transfer any contract is not obtained, Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, on the other hand, shall use reasonable
best efforts to effect mutually agreeable alternative arrangements designed
to provide Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, with substantially similar
rights and benefits that would have accrued to Purchaser or Reinsurer, as
applicable, had such consent, approval, waiver or agreement been obtained.

 

Section 8.11 _Use of Names; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Other than the Transferred Intellectual Property, none of Purchaser,
Reinsurer or any of their respective Affiliates are purchasing, acquiring or
otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in any Intellectual Property
of Sellers or their Affiliates, including the Names and Marks (except as
expressly set forth in this _Section 8.11_). None of Purchaser, Reinsurer or
any of their respective Affiliates shall seek to register in any jurisdiction
any of the Names and Marks, any Trademark confusingly similar thereto, or any
Trademark that incorporates a representation of all or a portion of the Statue
of Liberty, nor shall any of the foregoing contest the use, ownership,
validity or enforceability of any rights of Sellers or any of their Affiliates
in or to any of the Names and Marks. Except as expressly set forth in this
_Section 8.11_, (i) neither Purchaser, Reinsurer nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any rights in or to the Names and Marks, and (ii)
Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that any and all rights of
the Transferred Businesses to use the Names and Marks pursuant to any written
agreements or arrangements with Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the
Transaction Agreements) shall terminate on the Closing Date without recourse.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this _Section 8.11_ or in any
Ancillary Agreement, Purchaser, Reinsurer and their respective Affiliates
shall (i) cease and discontinue all uses of the Names and Marks immediately
upon the Closing; and (ii) not expressly, or by implication, do business as or
represent themselves as Sellers or their Affiliates.

 

(c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall file for
approval all required regulatory approvals of or relating to the merger of
the Company with and into Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (the "
_Internal Merger_ "), and Purchaser shall take all necessary steps to effect
the Internal Merger as soon as practicable after such required approvals
have been obtained. The Affiliate into which Purchaser merges the Company may
not include any of the Names and Marks in its legal name, corporate name or
business name. If Purchaser has not received all required regulatory approvals
for the Internal Merger by the end of the fifteenth (15th) month after
Closing, or if the Internal Merger is not otherwise complete by such time,
Purchaser shall, at the end of such fifteenth (15th) month, make all required
filings and pay any requisite fees necessary, and shall apply for their
certificates of incorporation or change of name (or equivalent organizational
documents) and business registration certificate or licenses,

 



114  as applicable, to be amended, pass the requisite shareholders resolutions
and board resolutions, pay all requisite fees to change the legal names,
corporate names and business names of the Transferred Companies to remove any
reference to the Names and Marks, in all jurisdictions, and shall effect such
changes as soon as practicable after any required approvals have been
obtained. In each of the foregoing cases, Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to diligently pursue the approvals described in this Section and
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, take any and all follow-up
actions that may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority to
promptly effect the Internal Merger and the changes of names described in
this Section. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Reinsurer be
required to take any actions, including entering into any Contract or amend or
modify any existing Contract (including the Reinsurance Agreement), or incur
any Liabilities whatsoever, in connection with the Internal Merger.

(d) Other than the use of the Names and Marks in the name of the Transferred
Companies as permitted under _Section 8.11(c)_, and such related uses of the
name of the Transferred Companies as are required by Law or are otherwise
necessary to identify the Transferred Companies in communications with third
parties, and except for such uses as are permitted under _Section 8.11(i)_ or
_Section 8.11(k)_, Purchaser will discontinue all uses of the Names and Marks
within (i) thirty (30) days after Closing, with respect to any advertising,
promotional materials, packaging, inventory, collateral goods, stationery,
envelopes, checks, business cards, product and service literature and
materials and other materials (collectively, " _Hard Materials_ ") existing
in inventory as of the Closing or generated by Purchaser, its Affiliates or
third parties after the Closing, (ii) sixty (60) days after Closing with
respect to any Hard Materials generated by Sellers or their Affiliates on
behalf of any Transferred Company, provided that Sellers shall implement
Purchasers reasonable and timely requests to alter such Materials to remove
or replace the Names and Marks within such sixty (60) day period, and (iii)
as promptly as practicable after the Closing but in any event within twelve
(12) months after the Closing, with respect to any software, electronic
materials, website content, invoices, receipts, forms, and training materials
(together with Hard Materials, " _Materials_ " _)_. After the Closing, to the
extent that any approval is required by Law to discontinue any such uses,
Purchaser shall seek such approvals within ten (10) Business Days after
becoming aware of such requirement, shall use reasonable best efforts to
discontinue such uses within the timeframes described above and, if a required
regulatory approval is not obtained within those timeframes, shall use
reasonable best efforts to diligently pursue such approval until such approval
is secured.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section 8.11_ or in any Ancillary
Agreement, Purchaser shall, from the date hereof until the Marks Transition
Date, have a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the Names and Marks, as described
in and/or for the purposes described in this _Section 8.11_, in connection
with the Transferred Businesses in substantially the same manner as such
Materials were used as of the Closing in all material respects. Any goodwill
arising from the use of the Names and Marks as described in this _Section
8.11_ shall inure to the benefit of Sellers and their Affiliates.

 

(f) Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that (i) use of the Names
and Marks during the period authorized by this  _Section 8.11_ shall only be
with respect to Materials existing in inventory at Closing or reprints
thereof, without alteration other than to remove the Names and Marks, and not
be for any materials or services introduced after the Closing (including any

 



115  marketing or advertising materials or product, training or service
literature developed following the Closing), (ii) the Materials and all
services offered in connection therewith shall be of a level of quality equal
to or greater than the quality of the materials and services with respect to
which the Transferred Businesses used the Names and Marks immediately prior to
Closing and (iii) during the period in which Purchaser or its Affiliates uses
any of the Names and Marks as permitted under this _Section 8.11_, neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall take or fail to take any action which, as a
result of such action or failure to take such action, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the value of any of the Names
and Marks or the goodwill of Sellers and their Affiliates associated
therewith, _provided_ that neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be
deemed to have violated this provision through any action or inaction that is
taken in the ordinary course of business consistent with Purchasers practices
operating under the "Lincoln" Trademark. Purchaser, Reinsurer and Sellers
shall each take all reasonable actions to ensure that any third Persons using
the Names and Marks on behalf of any Transferred Company, whose rights
terminate upon the Closing pursuant to this _Section 8.11_ shall cease use of
the Names and Marks, except as expressly authorized thereafter by Sellers.

(g) To the extent that any Transferred Company, or, solely in their capacity
as successors to the rights of a Transferred Company or a Transferred
Business, Purchaser, Reinsurer or any of their Affiliates, owns any rights in
or to any Names and Marks, including any registrations or applications for
registrations thereof in any jurisdiction, Purchaser or Reinsurer, as
applicable, shall, or shall cause the Transferred Company or its Affiliate, as
applicable, to, as soon as practicable after discovery or notice of such fact,
at Sellers option, either (i) abandon all such rights in and to such Names
and Marks, including abandoning any such registrations and applications for
registrations, or (ii) assign all such rights in and to such Names and Marks,
including any such registrations and applications for registrations, to
Sellers or an Affiliate of Sellers.

(h) Reinsurer shall, from the date hereof until the later of (x) ten (10)
Business Days after Purchaser has completed the Internal Merger or changed the
name of the Transferred Companies to remove the Names and Marks as described
in _Section 8.11(e)_ and (y) December 31, 2018, have a limited, personal,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable (solely to permitted
subcontractors pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement in
substantially the same manner in which Sellers and its Affiliates operated the
Life Business as of the Closing), royalty-free, paid up license to use the
Names and Marks solely as necessary to provide services under the
Administrative Services Agreement or as otherwise necessary to operate the
Life Business in substantially the same manner in which Sellers and their
Affiliates performed such services and operated such Life Business as of the
Closing. Any goodwill arising from the use of the Names and Marks as described
in this _Section 8.11(h)_ shall inure to the benefit of Sellers and their
Affiliates. Reinsurer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that (i) the use
of the Names and Marks during the period authorized by this _Section 8.11(h)_
and all services offered in connection therewith shall be of a level of
quality equal to or greater than the quality of the services with respect to
which the Sellers and their Affiliates used the Names and Marks immediately
prior to Closing, and (iii) during the period in which Reinsurer or its
Affiliates uses any of the Names and Marks as permitted under this _Section
8.11(h)_, neither Reinsurer nor its Affiliates shall take or fail to take any
action which action which, as a result of such action or failure to take
action, might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
value of any of the Names and Marks or the goodwill of Sellers and their
Affiliates associated therewith, provided that neither Reinsurer nor its
Affiliates shall be deemed to have violated this provision through any action
or inaction that is taken in the ordinary course of business consistent with
Reinsurers practices operating under the "Protective" Trademark as of the
date hereof.

 



116 (i) Without limitation to any other remedies, if Purchaser, Reinsurer or their
respective Affiliates fail to comply with the foregoing terms and conditions
or otherwise fail to comply with any reasonable direction of Sellers or any of
their Affiliates in relation to the use of the Names and Marks, Sellers shall
be entitled to a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
equitable relief in accordance with _Section 14.10_.

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, but without limiting Sellers or their
Affiliates rights and remedies under applicable Laws relating to Trademarks,
nothing in this _Section 8.11_ shall be deemed to require Purchaser,
Reinsurer or their respective Affiliates to alter their use of Trademarks
owned and used by any of the foregoing prior to the Closing.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Purchaser,
Reinsurer and the Transferred Companies shall be entitled to refer to the name
of Sellers or their Affiliates indefinitely as required by applicable Law, or
as reasonably necessary in regulatory filings, or otherwise in a non-
promotional manner for purposes of historical reference.

Section 8.12 _Employee Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Each of Purchaser and Purchaser Parent hereby covenants and agrees that
for a period from the date hereof (except as set forth in _Section 9.01_)

consent of Sellers, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ,
hire, or enter into an agency or consulting relationship with any of the
personnel employed by Sellers or their Affiliates set forth on Section 8.12(a)
of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, both during such employment and following
a termination of employment that is not a Liberty Qualifying Termination or
(ii) without the prior written consent of Reinsurer, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment, employ, hire, or enter into an agency or consulting

Affiliates or any Transferred Life Employee employed as administrative
assistants.

(b) Each of Reinsurer and Reinsurer Parent hereby covenants and agrees that

consent of Sellers, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ,
hire or enter into an agency or consulting relationship with any personnel
employed by Sellers or their Affiliates set forth on Section 8.12(b) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, both during such employment and following a
termination of employment that is not a Liberty Qualifying Termination or (ii)
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, directly or indirectly solicit
for employment, employ, hire, or enter into an agency or consulting
relationship with any Group Benefits Employee or Shared Employee who received
an offer of employment from Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to _Section
9.01(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ that this  _Section 8.12(b)_ shall not
apply to any personnel of Sellers or their Affiliates or any Transferred Group
Benefits Employee employed as administrative assistants.

 



117 (c) Each of Sellers and LMGI hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period

Affiliates shall, (i) without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
directly or indirectly solicit for employment, employ after the Closing Date,

without the prior written consent of Reinsurer, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment, employ after the Closing Date, hire, or enter into an
agency or consulting relationship with (x) any Life Employee to whom Reinsurer
has made an offer pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ and (y) any individuals
listed on Section 8.12(c) of the Reinsurer Disclosure Schedule, other than,
in the case of clause (x) for individuals who experience Life Qualifying
Terminations, and in the case of clause (y) for individuals who are no longer
employed by Reinsurer Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
8.12(c)_ shall not apply to any personnel of Purchaser or its Affiliates or to
any personnel of Reinsurer or its Affiliates employed as administrative
assistants, including any such administrative assistants who become
Transferred Group Benefits Employees or Transferred Life Employees. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event will Reinsurer be required to enter into any
Contract or amending or modifying any existing Contract (including the
Reinsurance Agreement) in connection with the Internal Merger.

(d) Each of Purchaser and Purchaser Parent and Reinsurer and Reinsurer Parent
hereby covenants and agrees that in the event this Agreement is terminated at

period prior to any such employment, hiring or agreement, was employed by, or

Employee who ceases to be employed by Sellers or their Affiliates for a
period of three (3) months. Each of Sellers and LMGI hereby covenant and agree
that in the event this Agreement is terminated at any time prior to the

general solicitations not targeted at such persons (including through the use
of recruiting firms not directed at such persons) or advertisement in any

Section 8.13 _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements, each of
Purchaser and Reinsurer acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements

causing to be commenced, instituted or maintained any legal or arbitral
proceeding of any kind against any Purchaser Releasee based upon any matter
released pursuant to this _Section 8.19(a)_. The parties hereto hereby
acknowledge and agree that the execution of this Agreement shall not
constitute an acknowledgment of or an admission by any Seller Releasor or

matter or precedent upon which any liability may be asserted. Sellers
acknowledge and agree that the payment of the aggregate consideration
pursuant hereto, and the covenants set forth in this Agreement, represent
good and sufficient consideration for every promise, duty, release,
obligation, agreement and right contained in this _Section 8.19(a)_.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the Transferred Companies and each of their
respective successors, assigns, heirs and executors (each, a " _Purchaser
Releasor_ "), hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily releases,
discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all claims, demands,

respective Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Reinsurer,
directly or indirectly solicit any holder of, or any beneficiary or insured
under, any Reinsured Contract in connection with any Program of Internal
Replacement, (it being understood that Sellers are not responsible and shall
not be liable for any independent action taken by any brokers or Producers
other than employees of Sellers or their Affiliates). As used herein, the term
" _Program of Internal Replacement_ " means any program that is initiated,
maintained, sponsored or supported by LMGI, either Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates to offer on a targeted basis to any or all
policyholders, contractholders, beneficiaries or insureds under Reinsured
Contracts to exchange any such Reinsured Contract or any portion thereof for
another Policy that is written by LMGI, either Seller, the Company or any
Affiliate of any of them but is not a Reinsured Contract.

Section 8.21  _Extraordinary Dividend_. Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be
necessary to permit the Company to pay to Sellers the Extraordinary Dividend
at or immediately prior to the Closing. In connection with the foregoing, if
(a) requested by (i) a Governmental Authority responsible for the regulation
of the Extraordinary Dividend or (ii) Standard and Poors Corporation or A.M.
Best Company, Inc. or (b) otherwise required to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the release of the guarantee set forth in
Section 8.08(c)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule), Purchaser shall enter
into, effective as of the Closing, a guarantee of the obligations of the
Company that is reasonably acceptable to (i) each Governmental Authority
responsible for the regulation of the Extraordinary Dividend and such
guarantee and (ii) each of Standard and Poors Corporation and A.M. Best
Company, Inc. In the event that a Governmental Authority indicates that it
will not approve the Extraordinary Dividend without an increase in the
Companys surplus, at Purchasers election (in its sole discretion), the
Company will issue to Purchaser on the Closing Date (but before the Closing)
the Closing Date Surplus Note in exchange for a cash purchase price, payable
by Purchaser, equal to the principal amount of the Closing Date Surplus
Note. The Closing Date Surplus Note, if any, shall have the terms mutually
agreed to by Purchaser and the Company at the time of issuance. Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Company to, take all actions necessary for the
Company to redeem and repay in full the Closing Date Surplus Note effective
immediately following the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by Purchaser of an amount equal to the
principal amount of the Closing Date Surplus Note. Upon such payment,
Purchaser shall cancel and surrender the Closing Date Surplus Note to the
Company and cooperate with the Company to effect the cancellation of such
Closing Date Surplus Note immediately following such payment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser withdraws its request for the
Extraordinary Dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser
withdraws its request for the Extraordinary Dividend Purchaser shall notify
Sellers of such withdrawal) or the Closing Date Surplus Note (if any),
Sellers shall have no obligations in respect of such Extraordinary Dividend or
Closing Date Surplus Note hereunder.

 



126 Section 8.22 _Legacy Products_. During the DA Transition Period, except as
required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, modify any of the Liberty Legacy Products or substitute
other life insurance or annuity products for any of the Liberty Legacy
Products, in each case without the prior written consent of Sellers and
Reinsurer.

Section 8.23 _Discovered Contracts_.

 

(a) For a period of (i) thirty six (36) months following the Closing Date with
respect to all Reinsured Contracts for which premium payment thereunder is
scheduled and periodic and (ii) sixty (60) months following the Closing Date
with respect to all other Reinsured Contracts, if the Company or Reinsurer
discovers any Reinsured Contracts that it has a good faith basis for
asserting were not taken into account in the Final Statement of Net Settlement
(each such Reinsured Contract not so taken into account, a " _Discovered
Contract_ "), Purchaser shall cause the Company to promptly notify Sellers
and Reinsurer, or Reinsurer shall promptly notify Sellers and the Company, as
applicable, regarding such Discovered Contract, which notice shall be
accompanied by supporting evidence, which may include the Updated Seriatim
File and Post-Closing Seriatim File, reasonably sufficient to establish that
such Reinsured Contract was not taken into account in the Final Statement of
Net Settlement. For purposes of the requirement set forth in the preceding
sentence, with respect to any Reinsured Contract written prior to the date of
the Updated Seriatim File or the Post-Closing Seriatim File, as applicable,
the fact that such Reinsured Contract is not listed on the Updated Seriatim
File or the Post-Closing Seriatim File, as applicable, shall be presumed
evidence sufficient to establish that such Reinsured Contract was not taken
into account in the Final Statement of Net Settlement; _provided_ , _however_
, that Sellers may rebut such presumption through evidence demonstrating
that such Reinsured Contract was taken into account in the Final Statement of
Net Settlement. Upon establishing that a Reinsured Contract constitutes a
Discovered Contract, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, Reinsurer
shall calculate the Discovered Contract Transfer Amount for such Discovered
Contract and provide such calculation (with reasonable supporting detail) to
Sellers and the Company (a " _Discovered Contract Notice_ "). Subject to 
_Section 8.23(f)_, Sellers shall pay to Reinsurer in cash an aggregate amount
equal to such Discovered Contract Transfer Amount within thirty (30) days
after Reinsurers delivery of such Discovered Contract Notice to Sellers. 

(b) If Sellers have a good faith objection to the calculation of the
Discovered Contract Transfer Amount set forth in the Discovered Contract
Notice, within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such Discovered
Contract Notice, Sellers shall deliver written notice of such objection to
Reinsurer, with a copy to the Company. If Sellers deliver a notice of
objection in respect of a Discovered Contract Notice, the parties shall seek
to resolve such objection within five (5) Business Days. If Sellers and
Reinsurer are unable to reach resolution on a Discovered Contract Notice
within five (5) Business Days following Sellers delivery of such notice of
objection, Reinsurer or Sellers may submit the dispute to an Independent
Actuary for final determination. For the avoidance of doubt, all other
disputes with respect to Discovered Contracts, including as to whether a
Policy constitutes a Discovered Contract, shall be settled pursuant to
_Section 14.06_.

 



127 (c) Upon referral of any dispute pursuant to _Section 8.23(b)_ to an
Independent Actuary, each party to such dispute shall enter into a customary
engagement letter with such Independent Actuary. In addition to the foregoing,
each party shall reasonably cooperate with such Independent Actuary and
provide, upon the request of such Independent Actuary, any non-privileged
information and documentation, including any accountants work papers or
internal accounting records or reserving papers, files and models, and make
reasonably available to such Independent Actuary such personnel that have
been involved in applicable components of the Discovered Contract Notice or
related notice of objection, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants and outside actuaries, as applicable, of each party
to such dispute shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to
such Independent Actuary unless and until such Independent Actuary has signed
a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants or outside actuaries, as applicable. Any such
information and documentation provided by a party to such Independent Actuary
shall concurrently be provided to the other party or parties to the dispute
to the extent not already so provided; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
independent accountants and outside actuaries of each party to the dispute, as
applicable, shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to a
party unless and until such party has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants or outside
actuaries, as applicable.

(d) The parties shall instruct the Independent Actuary to (i) comply with and
adhere to the requirements of this Agreement, including the definitions
contained herein and the Schedules attached hereto (including the Statement of
Net Settlement Methods, the Final Statement of Net Settlement Walk and, to the
extent applicable, the Balance Sheet Methods and Final Balance Sheet Walk)
and (ii) as respects any amount set forth in a Discovered Contract Notice that
is in dispute, not assign a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either (I) Reinsurer in a Discovered Contract Notice
or (II) Sellers or Reinsurer in any initial or supplemental materials
delivered to the Independent Actuary pursuant to _Section 8.23(c)_ or (B)
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either (I) Reinsurer in
a Discovered Contract Notice or (II) Sellers or Reinsurer in any initial or
supplemental materials delivered to the Independent Actuary pursuant to
_Section 8.23(c)_.

 

(e) The determination of the Independent Actuary shall be final and binding
upon the parties and any changes to a Discovered Contract Notice shall be
incorporated by reference therein; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers or
Reinsurer may request that the Independent Actuary correct any clerical,
typographical or computational errors in its decision within three (3)
Business Day of the delivery of such decision to such party. The fees of such
Independent Actuary shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Actuary shall act as an expert, not as
an arbitrator, and neither the determination of the Independent Actuary, nor
this agreement to submit to the determination of the Independent Actuary,
shall be subject to or governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 B.S.C. § 1
et seq., or any state arbitration Law or regime.

(f) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Sellers, on a several and not
joint basis, shall be liable pursuant to  _Section 13.03_ (other than
_Section 13.03(d)_), _Section 8.23_ and _Section 10.01(b)_ shall not exceed
the Aggregate Ceding Commission.

 



128 Section 8.24 _Filing Cooperation_. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Sellers shall provide, and shall cause the Company to provide, and
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide, and shall cause the
Company to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with (i) the filing

registration statement or other documents under the Securities Act, (ii) the
satisfaction by Purchaser, Reinsurer or any of their Affiliates of any of its
reporting obligations under, and in compliance with, the Exchange Act, and
(iii) the preparation of any prospectus, private placement memorandum or other
offering document to be used in connection with any public offering, private
placement or other financing transaction of Purchaser, Reinsurer or any of
their Affiliates, in each case as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or
Reinsurer, as applicable, including by preparing and furnishing to Purchaser
or Reinsurer upon its reasonable request any audited or unaudited financial
statement, audit reports or other financial information or data with respect
to pre-Closing periods of the Company or the Life Business, in each case, to
the extent reasonably available to Sellers, the Company or their
respective Affiliates through the exercise of reasonable best efforts.
Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, shall promptly, upon request by
Sellers, reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates, as applicable, for all
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sellers,
the Company or their respective Affiliates, as applicable, in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 8.24_.

shall cause their Affiliates to, promptly notify Purchaser in the event that
the Specified Actuary issues a new or revised Group Benefits Actuarial Report.
From and after the date hereof, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, promptly notify Reinsurer in the event the Specified Actuary
issues a new or revised Life Actuarial Report or any errata with respect to
the Life Actuarial Report (and shall promptly deliver a copy of any new or
revised Life Actuarial Report or errata with respect to a Life Actuarial
Report to Reinsurer), or notifies Sellers or any of their Affiliates that the
Life Actuarial Report is inaccurate.

Section 8.26 _Reinsurance Contracts_. From the date hereof until the Closing,
in the event that the Company receives written, or to the Knowledge of
Sellers, oral notice of a proposed increase in the reinsurance rates payable
under any Reinsurance Contract pursuant to which liabilities of a Reinsured
Contract are ceded, Sellers shall cause the Company to (a) promptly provide
Reinsurer written notice of such proposed increase and copies of any related
written correspondence from the reinsurer under such Reinsurance Contract and
(b) provide Reinsurer an opportunity to consult with the Company with respect
to the decision of whether to accept, negotiate or contest such proposed rate
increase applicable to such Reinsurance Contract. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Sellers shall cause (i) the Company to furnish a copy of any

132 ARTICLE IX

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 9.01 _Group Benefits Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Offers of Employment_. Following the date hereof, Sellers shall provide
Purchaser with updated versions of Sections 4.27(c) and 4.27(e) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule no less frequently than monthly to reflect new
hires, terminations or other personnel changes, in each case, as permitted
under _Section 8.01(a)(xii)_ occurring between the date hereof and the date
of such update, and shall provide a final updated version of each such Section
no later than twenty-five (25) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Final Group Benefits Employee Census_ "). No later
than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, extend a Comparable Offer of Employment with
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to each Group Benefits Employee set forth
in the Final Group Benefits Employee Census, with each such offer to be
contingent on the Group Benefits Employee being continuously employed by
Sellers through the Closing Date (or such later date contemplated by _Section
9.01(a)(ii)_) and commencing active employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates on the Closing Date (or such later date contemplated by _Section
9.01(a)(ii)_), and with respect to any Inactive Group Benefits Employee or
Alien Group Benefits Employee, subject to the additional conditions set forth
in _Sections 9.01(a)(ii)_ and _Section 9.01(a)(iii)_ (such conditions,
collectively the " _Purchaser Employment Conditions_ "). During the period
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and reasonably assist
Purchaser in its efforts to extend and secure acceptances of Comparable Offers
of Employment from the Group Benefits Employees. Purchaser shall provide
Sellers forms of the documents that Purchaser uses to make Comparable Offers
of Employment prior to the time that such Comparable Offers of Employment are
made. In the event Purchaser fails to make a Comparable Offer of Employment
to a Group Benefits Employee and the Group Benefits Employee does not become a
Transferred Group Benefits Employee, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
reimburse Sellers for any resulting severance pay or benefits under the
terms of Sellers severance policy as set forth in Section 9.01 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the " _Sellers  Severance Policy_") within
thirty (30) days following the receipt by Purchaser of an invoice
from Sellers; _provided_ that such Group Benefits Employees employment is
terminated by Sellers within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date.

 

(i) The parties intend for the employment of each Group Benefits Employee who
accepts a Comparable Offer of Employment by Purchaser in writing prior to the
Closing Date (or such later date contemplated by _Section 9.01(a)(ii)_) and
who satisfies the Purchaser Employment Conditions to continue employment
uninterrupted on and after the Closing Date (or such later date contemplated
by _Section 9.01(a)(ii)_) with Purchaser or its Affiliates (the date such
Group Benefits Employee commences active employment with Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, the " _Group Benefits Employee Transfer Date_ "). Upon the
Transfer Date, such Group Benefits Employee will become an employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliate and is hereinafter referred to as a " _Transferred
Group Benefits Employee_." As of the Transfer Date, such Transferred Group
Benefits Employee shall terminate employment with Sellers and their Affiliates
and cease to actively participate in or accrue benefits under any Group
Benefits Plan (other than a Group Benefits Business Plan).

 



133 (ii) With respect to any Inactive Group Benefits Employee,
Purchasers Comparable Offer of Employment shall also be contingent on such
Inactive Group Benefits Employees return to active status within six (6)
months following the Closing Date or such longer period as required by Law;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be required to make an offer of employment to any Inactive
Group Benefits Employee (and shall have no obligation of any nature to hire or
employ any such Inactive Group Benefits Employee) who is receiving long-term
disability benefits. Sellers or their applicable Affiliate shall continue to
employ and shall remain responsible for any Liabilities related to any
Inactive Group Benefits Employee (other than Inactive Group Benefits
Employees who are receiving long-term disability benefits as of the Closing
Date) unless and until such individual returns to active status within six (6)
months following the Closing Date or such longer period as required by Law.
For each Inactive Group Benefits Employee receiving long-term disability
benefits as of the Closing Date who is able to return to active status within
six (6) months following the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate, in good faith, to determine whether an available
position for such Inactive Group Benefits Employee exists at Purchaser or its
Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
not be required to make an offer of employment to any such Inactive Group
Benefits Employee and Sellers or their applicable Affiliate shall remain
responsible for any Liabilities related to or arising out of such Inactive
Group Benefits Employees employment or termination of employment with
Sellers or their applicable Affiliate unless and until such Inactive Group
Benefits Employee becomes a Transferred Group Benefits Employee.

 

(iii) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to employ, or cause
its Affiliates to employ, those Group Benefits Employees who are foreign
nationals working in the United States in non-immigrant status and those Group
Benefits Employees for whom there are pending or approved I-140 immigrant
petitions as of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Alien Group Benefits
Employees_ "), under terms and conditions such that Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries qualify as a "successor employer" under applicable United States
immigration Laws, including 8 U.S.C. § 1184(c)(10), effective as of the
Closing Date or such later date contemplated by _Section 9.01(a)(ii)_. As of
the day after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume all
immigration-related interests and obligations under applicable U.S.
immigration Laws with respect to such Alien Group Benefits Employees who
become Transferred Group Benefits Employees and shall reimburse Sellers for
any resulting severance pay or benefits in accordance with _Section 9.01(a)_
for those Alien Group Benefits Employees who do not become Transferred Group
Benefits Employees and whose employment is terminated by Sellers within ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Benefits_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the earlier of December 31, 2019 and the date that is eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date (or through such earlier date as such
Transferred Group Benefits Employees employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliate is terminated for any reason) (such period, the 

 



134  " _Group Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall provide, or shall
cause its Affiliates to provide, each Transferred Group Benefits Employee who
commences employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate on or following the
Closing Date with the following: (i) base salary and base wages, short-term or
annual incentive compensation opportunities, long-term incentive compensation
opportunities and commission opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no
less than the Base Salary and Base Wages, short-term or annual incentive
compensation opportunities, long-term incentive compensation opportunities and
commission opportunities in effect for such Transferred Group Benefits
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits
that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee benefits, in
the aggregate, provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates as in effect from time to time (and excluding any plans in which
newly hired employees are not eligible).

(c)  _2018 Short-Term Incentives for Periods Prior to the Transfer Date_.
Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.01(b)_, Purchaser shall
provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each such Transferred Group
Benefits Employee who remains employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates on the
applicable payment date with (i) a short-term or annual incentive opportunity
with respect to the portion of 2018 that follows the Closing that is not less
than the full amount of the short-term or annual incentive opportunity
provided by Sellers or their Affiliates to such Transferred Group Benefits
Employee in respect of 2017, based on such Transferred Group Benefits
Employees Base Salary or Base Wages as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the " _2018 Group Benefits Incentive_ ") or (ii) a commission
opportunity that is not less than the commission opportunity set forth in the
Distribution Incentive Arrangement applicable to such Transferred Group
Benefits Employee; _provided_ that the Balance Sheet reflects an accrual with
respect to such amount (to the extent not yet paid to the Transferred Group
Benefits Employees) equal to the product of (A) the aggregate amount of 2018
Group Benefits Incentives and the Distribution Incentive Arrangements for all
Transferred Group Benefits Employees (determined under GAAP) and (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in 2018 up to
and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is three hundred
sixty five (365).

(d) _Severance_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.01(b)_, with
respect to each Transferred Group Benefits Employee who incurs a Group
Benefits Qualifying Termination during the Group Benefits Continuation Period,
subject to the Transferred Group Benefits Employee timely executing and not
revoking a waiver and general release agreement in the form customarily used
by Purchaser, pursuant to which such Transferred Group Benefits Employee shall
also release and waive any and all claims against Sellers and
their Affiliates, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide such Transferred
Group Benefits Employee with (i) cash severance payments that are available
under either (A) the Sellers Severance Policy or (B) the
Purchasers severance policy in which similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates are eligible to participate as in effect from
time to time, with the applicable policy to be that which provides the
terminated Transferred Group Benefits Employee the greatest cash severance
amount (without regard to the value of other benefits, whether or not
denominated in cash), and (ii) severance benefits that are available under the
Purchasers severance policy in which similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates are eligible to participate from time to time;
_provided_ that Purchaser and its Affiliates may, in their sole discretion and
subject to compliance with the requirements under Section 409A of the Code,
pay such severance payments and benefits in a lump sum in lieu of payments
over time. If Purchaser or any of its

 



135  Affiliates incurs any severance liabilities pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)(i)_ in respect of a Shared Employee who incurs a Group Benefits
Qualifying Termination during or upon the conclusion of the Group Benefits
Continuation Period, Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for fifty percent (50%)
of the amount payable pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(i)_ within thirty (30)
days following the receipt by Sellers of an invoice from Purchaser.

(e) _401(k) Plan._ Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective
no later than the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall have in
effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (and a
related trust exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code)
(collectively, the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). Each Transferred Group
Benefits Employee participating in a Group Benefits Plan that is a defined
contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Group
Benefits 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date
shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as soon as
administratively practicable on or following the Transfer Date. If elected by
a Transferred Group Benefits Employee in accordance with applicable Law,
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct rollover"
to such Purchaser 401(k) Plan of the account balances of such Transferred
Group Benefits Employee (including up to two (2) promissory notes evidencing
outstanding loans) under the Group Benefits 401(k) Plan.

 

(f) _Service Credit_. Each Transferred Group Benefits Employee shall be
credited, under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates in
which Transferred Group Benefits Employees commence participation after the
Transfer Date (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), with the same amount of service
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits as
was credited by Sellers and their Affiliates as of the Closing Date under
similar or comparable Group Benefits Plans (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), except (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under qualified
and nonqualified defined benefit plans, (ii) for all purposes under a retiree
welfare plan, (iii) under any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that
provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population, (iv) to the extent
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits, and (v) where prior
service is not recognized for similarly situated employees of Purchaser and
its Affiliates. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser or its Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (A) cause, with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the
Transferred Group Benefits Employees commence to participate following the
Transfer Date, each Transferred Group Benefits Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting period,
to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under an
Old Plan and (B) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Group
Benefits Employee, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of such New
Benefit Plan to be waived for such Transferred Group Benefits Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any Old Plan. Purchaser or
its Affiliate shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Transferred
Group Benefits Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Transferred Group
Benefits Employees participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Transferred

 



136  Group Benefits Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit
Plan. Prior to and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, or shall cause
their Affiliates and plan administrators to, provide all reasonably necessary
support and information in a timely manner as may be requested by Purchaser or
its Affiliates or the administrators of the New Benefit Plans to implement
this _Section 9.01(f)_.

__(g) _Benefit Plan Liabilities Retained by Sellers_. Sellers and
their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall retain and be
solely responsible for all Liabilities under the Benefit Plans, except
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall expressly assume the Liabilities under the
Group Benefits Business Plan as set forth in Section 9.01(g) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule. __

__(h) _Welfare Benefit Claims._ As of the Transfer Date, each Transferred
Group Benefits Employee shall cease participation with respect to periods on
and following the Transfer Date in the health and welfare benefit plans of
Sellers and their Affiliates and, as of the Transfer Date, such Transferred
Group Benefits Employee shall be eligible to commence participation in the New
Benefit Plans that provide health and welfare benefits. Sellers shall be
responsible for all Liabilities with respect to claims incurred by Transferred
Group Benefits Employees (and their beneficiaries and covered dependents)
prior to the Transfer Date under Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental,
vision and prescription drug coverage, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance and disability coverage.
Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities with respect to claims
incurred by Transferred Group Benefits Employees (and their beneficiaries and
covered dependents) on and after the Transfer Date under New Benefit Plans
that provide medical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage, life,
accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance and
disability coverage. For purposes of this _Section 9.01(h)_, the following
claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) with respect to short-
term disability, long-term disability, life and accidental death and
dismemberment benefits, upon the event giving rise to such benefits, and (ii)
with respect to medical, dental, vision care, prescription and health-related
benefits, upon provision of medical, dental, vision, prescription and health-
related services, materials or supplies. Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Companies) shall be responsible for providing the
continuation of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code
to any Group Benefits Employee (and his or her qualified beneficiaries) for
whom a "qualifying event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code
occurs prior to the Transfer Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for providing the continuation of group health coverage required
by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to any Transferred Group Benefits Employee
(and his or qualified beneficiaries) for whom a "qualifying event" within the
meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs on or after the Transfer Date.
__

 

 __(i) _Workers  Compensation. _Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Transfer Date by any
Transferred Group Benefits Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that
are incurred on and after the Transfer Date by any Transferred Group Benefits
Employee. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be
incurred on the date the injury giving rise to the claim occurs. __

 



137 __(j) _Accrued Paid Time-Off_. On or as soon as practicable following the
applicable Group Benefits Employee Transfer Date, Sellers shall pay all
accrued but unused paid time-off for each Transferred Group Benefits Employee.
During the Group Benefits Continuation Period, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, provide annual leave, vacation and paid time off benefits
to Transferred Group Benefits Employees that are at least as favorable as
those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates; _provided_ that Transferred Group Benefits Employees shall begin
accruing annual leave, vacation and paid time off benefits from Purchaser or
its Affiliates on the applicable Group Benefits Employee Transfer Date, and
shall be permitted to borrow against their annual vacation entitlements
before they are earned for the one-year period following the applicable Group
Benefits Employee Transfer Date (it being understood and agreed that such
borrowed amounts would be required to be repaid by such Transferred Group
Benefits Employee if such Transferred Group Benefits Employees employment
terminates prior to the applicable annual vacation entitlement having been
earned), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the applicable vacation
or paid time off policy of Purchaser and its Affiliates. __

__(k) _Employee Communications_. On and after the date hereof, any broad-based
employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting)
provided to Group Benefits Employees by Sellers or their Affiliates, on the
one hand, or Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to
employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or
related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the other
party, and the party seeking to distribute any such notice or communication
shall consider in good faith revising such notice or communication to reflect
any comments or advice that the other party timely provides. __

9.01_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of
the parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or

any other related Contract, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any Group Benefits Plan or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement whether of Sellers or

reasonably request from time to time to identify and evaluate which, if any,
Other Life Employees to whom a Comparable Offer of Employment will be made by
Reinsurer in its sole discretion. No later than sixty (60) days following the
date hereof (such date being the " _Notice Date_ "), Reinsurer shall provide
Sellers with a written notice of the Other Life Employees, if any, to whom it
will extend an offer of employment (each such Other Life Employee being, a "
_Selected Other Life Employee_ "). No later than five (5) Business Days
following the Notice Date, Reinsurer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
extend a Comparable Offer of Employment with Reinsurer or one of its
Affiliates to each Life Offer Employee (other than any Life Offer Employee
who is on long-term disability leave as of the Closing Date) and each Selected
Other Life Employee, with the offer to be contingent on the Life Offer
Employee or Selected Other Life Employee being continuously employed by
Sellers through the Closing Date (or such later date as set forth on Section
9.02(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated by _Section
9.02(a)(ii)_), and commencing active employment with Reinsurer or its
Affiliates on the Closing Date (or such later date as set forth on Section
9.02(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated by _Section
9.02(a)(ii)_), and with respect to any Inactive Life Employee who is a Life
Offer Employee or Alien Life Employee, subject to the additional conditions
set forth in _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_ and _Section 9.02(a)(iii)_, respectively
(such conditions, collectively the " _Reinsurer Employment Conditions_ ").
During the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with
Reinsurer and reasonably assist Reinsurer in its efforts to extend and secure
acceptances of Comparable Offers of Employment from the Life Employees to
whom such offers are made. Reinsurer shall provide Sellers forms of the
documents that Reinsurer uses to make Comparable Offers of Employment prior to
the time that such Comparable Offers of Employment are made. 

(i) The date a Life Employee commences employment with Reinsurer or any of its
Affiliates will be the " _Life Employee Transfer Date_ ". Upon the Transfer
Date, such Life Employee will become an employee of Reinsurer or its Affiliate
and is hereinafter referred to as a " _Transferred Life Employee_." As of the
Transfer Date, such Transferred Life Employee shall terminate employment with
Sellers and their Affiliates and cease to actively participate in or accrue
benefits under any Life Plan (other than a Life Business Plan).

 

(ii) With respect to any Inactive Life Employee who is a Life Offer Employee,
Reinsurers Comparable Offer of Employment shall also be contingent on such
Inactive Life Employees return to active status within six (6) months
following the Closing Date or such longer period as required by Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Reinsurer shall not be required to make an offer of employment
to any Inactive Life Employee (and shall have no obligation of any nature to
hire or employ any such Inactive Life Employee) who is receiving long-
term disability benefits. Sellers or their applicable Affiliate shall
continue to employ and shall remain responsible for any Liabilities related to
any Inactive Life Employee (other than Inactive Life Employees who are
receiving long-term disability benefits as of the Closing Date) unless and
until such individual returns to active status within six (6) months

 



139  following the Closing Date or such longer period as required by Law. For
each Inactive Life Employee receiving long-term disability benefits as of the
Closing Date who is able to return to active status within six (6) months
following the Closing Date, Sellers and Reinsurer shall reasonably cooperate,
in good faith, to determine whether an available position for such Inactive
Life Employee exists at Reinsurer or its Affiliates;  _provided_ , _however_
, that Reinsurer and its Affiliates shall not be required to make an offer of
employment to any such Inactive Life Employee and Sellers or their applicable
Affiliate shall remain responsible for any Liabilities related to or arising
out of such Inactive Life Employees employment or termination of employment
with Sellers or their applicable Affiliate unless and until such Inactive Life
Employee becomes a Transferred Life Employee.

 

(iii) Reinsurer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to employ, or cause
its Affiliates to employ, those Life Offer Employees who are foreign
nationals working in the United States in non-immigrant status and those Life
Offer Employees for whom there are pending or approved I-140 immigrant
petitions as of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Alien Life Employees_
"), under terms and conditions such that Reinsurer and its Affiliate qualify
as a "successor employer" under applicable United States immigration Laws,
including 8 U.S.C. §1184(c)(10), effective as of the Closing Date or such
later date contemplated by _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_. As of the day after the
Closing Date, or such later date as contemplated by _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_,
Reinsurer and its Affiliates shall, to the extent required by applicable law
to be a "successor employer" assume all immigration-related interests and
obligations under applicable U.S. immigration Laws with respect to such Alien
Life Employees who become Transferred Life Employees; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that nothing in this _Section 9.02(a)(iii)_ shall otherwise affect the
Liabilities retained by Sellers with respect to such Alien Life Employees (it
being understood and agreed that Sellers shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 13.08_ and _Section 13.09_, indemnify and hold Reinsurer and its
Affiliates harmless for any Liabilities required to be assumed pursuant to
this clause (iii) to the extent that such Liabilities arise out of any act or
omission occurring before the applicable Transfer Date.

(b) _Post-Closing Benefits_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the earlier of December 31, 2019 and the date that is eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date (or through such earlier date as such
Transferred Life Employees employment with Reinsurer or its Affiliate is
terminated for any reason) (such period, the " _Life Continuation Period_ "),
Reinsurer shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each
Transferred Life Employee who commences employment with Reinsurer or
its Affiliate on or following the Closing Date with the following: (i) base
salary and base wages, short-term or annual incentive compensation
opportunities, long-term incentive compensation opportunities and commission
opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less than the Base Salary and
Base Wages, short-term or annual incentive compensation opportunities, long-
term incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities in
effect for such Transferred Life Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable
than the employee benefits, in the aggregate, provided to similarly situated
employees of Reinsurer and its Affiliates as in effect from time to time (and
excluding any plans in which newly hired employees are not eligible).

 



140 __(c) _2018 Short-Term Incentives for Periods Prior to the Transfer Date._
Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.02(b)_, Reinsurer shall
provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each such Transferred Life
Employee who remains employed by Reinsurer or its Affiliates on the applicable
payment date with short-term or annual incentive or commission compensation
(expressed in dollars) with respect to 2018 that is not less than the targeted
amount of the short-term or annual incentive or commission compensation
offered by Sellers to such Transferred Life Employee in respect of service
during 2017 (the " _2018 Life Incentive_ "); _provided_ that the Statement of
Net Settlement reflects an accrual (to the extent not yet paid to the
Transferred Life Employees) with respect to such amount equal to the product
of (A) the aggregate amount of 2018 Life Incentives for all Transferred Life
Employees and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
2018 up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
three hundred sixty-five (365). __

(d) _Severance_. Without limiting the generality of  _Section 9.02(b)_, with
respect to each Transferred Life Employee who incurs a Life Qualifying
Termination during the Life Continuation Period, subject to the Transferred
Life Employee timely executing and not revoking a waiver and general release
agreement in the form customarily used by Reinsurer pursuant to which such
Transferred Life Employee shall also release and waive any and all claims
against Sellers and their Affiliates, Reinsurer and its Affiliates shall
provide such Transferred Life Employee with the severance payments and
benefits that are available under the Sellers Severance Policy; _provided_
that Reinsurer and its Affiliate may, in its sole discretion and subject to
compliance with the requirements under Section 409A of the Code, pay such
severance payments and benefits in a lump sum in lieu of payments over time.
In the event that Reinsurer or any of its Affiliates incurs any severance
liabilities pursuant to this  _Section 9.02(d)_, in respect of a Life Offer
Employee who incurs a Life Qualifying Termination during or upon the
conclusion of the eighteen (18) month period including and immediately
following the Closing Date, Sellers shall reimburse Reinsurer or its
applicable Affiliates for all costs incurred pursuant to this _Section
9.02(d)_ within thirty (30) days following the receipt by Sellers of an
invoice from Reinsurer.

 

(e) _401(k) Plan._ Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective
no later than the Transfer Date, Reinsurer or its Affiliates shall have in
effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (and a
related trust exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code)
(collectively, the " _Reinsurer 401(k) Plan_ "). Each Transferred Life
Employee participating in a Life Plan that is a defined contribution plan that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning
of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Life 401(k) Plan_ ")
immediately prior to the applicable Transfer Date shall be eligible to
participate in the Reinsurer 401(k) Plan as soon as administratively
practicable on or following the Transfer Date. If elected by a Transferred
Life Employee in accordance with applicable Law, Reinsurer shall cause the
Reinsurer 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct rollover" to such Reinsurer 401(k)
Plan of the account balances of such Transferred Life Employee (including up
to two (2) promissory notes evidencing outstanding loans) under the Life
401(k) Plan.

 



141 (f) _Service Credit._ Each Transferred Life Employee shall be credited, under
the employee benefit plans of Reinsurer and its Affiliates in which
Transferred Life Employees commence participation after the Transfer Date (the
" _New Reinsurer Benefit Plans_ "), with the same amount of service for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits as was
credited by Sellers and their Affiliates as of the Closing Date under similar
or comparable Life Plans (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Life Plans_ "),
except (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under qualified and nonqualified
defined benefit plans, (ii) for all purposes under a retiree welfare plan,
(iii) under any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits
to a grandfathered employee population, (iv) to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits, and (v) where prior service is not
recognized for similarly situated employees of Reinsurer and its Affiliates.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Reinsurer
or its Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause, with
respect to any New Reinsurer Benefit Plans in which the Transferred Life
Employees commence to participate following the Transfer Date, each
Transferred Life Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in such
New Reinsurer Benefit Plans, without any waiting period, to the extent
coverage under such New Reinsurer Benefit Plans replaces coverage under an
Old Life Plan and (B) for purposes of each New Reinsurer Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Life Employee, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of such
New Reinsurer Benefit Plan to be waived for such Transferred Life Employee
and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any Old Life Plan.
Reinsurer or its Affiliate shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Transferred Life Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Life Plan ending on the date such Transferred Life
Employees participation in the corresponding New Reinsurer Benefit Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Reinsurer Benefit Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Transferred Life Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Reinsurer Benefit Plan. Prior to and after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates and plan
administrators to, provide all reasonably necessary support and information
in a timely manner as may be requested by Reinsurer or its Affiliates or the
administrators of the New Reinsurer Benefit Plans to implement this _Section
9.02(f)_.

 

 __(g) _Benefit Plan Liabilities Retained by Sellers_. Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall retain and be solely
responsible for all Liabilities under the Benefit Plans, except Reinsurer and
its Affiliates shall expressly assume the Liabilities under the Life Business
Plan as set forth in Section 9.02(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. __

(h) _Welfare Benefit Claims_. As of the Transfer Date, each Transferred Life
Employee shall cease participation with respect to periods on and following
the Transfer Date in the health and welfare benefit plans of Sellers and their
Affiliates and, as of the Transfer Date, such Transferred Life Employee shall
be eligible to commence participation in the New Reinsurer Benefit Plans that
provide health and welfare benefits. Sellers shall be responsible for all
Liabilities with respect to claims incurred by Life Employees (and their
beneficiaries and covered dependents) prior to the Transfer Date
under Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental, vision and prescription
drug coverage, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance and disability coverage. Reinsurer shall be responsible for

and prescription drug coverage, life, accidental death and

 



142  dismemberment and business travel accident insurance and disability

services, materials or supplies. Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) shall be responsible for providing the continuation of
group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to any Life
Employee (and his or her qualified beneficiaries) for whom a "qualifying
event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs prior to the
Transfer Date. Reinsurer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing
the continuation of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the
Code to any Transferred Life Employee (and his or qualified

Transferred Life Employee. Reinsurer and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on and

compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred on the date the injury
giving rise to the claim occurs. __

 

 __(j) _Accrued Paid Time-Off_. On or as soon as practicable following the
applicable Life Employee Transfer Date, Sellers shall pay all accrued but
unused paid time-off for each Transferred Life Employee. During the Life
Continuation Period, Reinsurer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide annual leave, vacation and paid time off benefits to Transferred Life
Employees that are at least as favorable as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Reinsurer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , that

paid time off benefits from Reinsurer or its Affiliates on the applicable
Life Employee Transfer Date, and shall be permitted borrow against their
annual vacation entitlements before they are earned for the one-year period
following the applicable Life Employee Transfer Date (it being understood and
agreed that such borrowed amounts would be required to be repaid by such
Transferred Life Employee if such Transferred Life Employees employment
terminates prior to the applicable annual vacation entitlement having been
earned), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
vacation or paid time off policy of Reinsurer and its Affiliate. __

(k)  _Employee Communications_. On and after the date hereof, any broad-based
employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting)
provided to Life Employees by Sellers or their Affiliates, on the one hand, or
Reinsurer or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to employment,

9.02_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of
the parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or

including reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item

resulting from any Taxes taken into account on the Final Settlement Report.

Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Balance Sheet Date Straddle Period, (b) Taxes (other than Property
Taxes and premium Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Balance Sheet Date Tax Period
shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on

but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on the Balance Sheet Date and the period
beginning after the Balance Sheet Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period.

Section 10.04 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Sellers shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies), on the one hand, and any of
the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand
(a " _Combined Tax Return_ "), and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any
Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of
the Transferred Companies for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_ "); _provided_  that
Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared any Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with past practices of the applicable
Transferred Companies, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable
Law. Sellers 

 



148  shall timely file or cause to be timely filed any Combined Tax Return and
any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed on or before
the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions). Sellers shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (A) with respect to
income Taxes, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions), and (B) with respect to
non-income Taxes, as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions), and, in
each case, Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax
Returns. Purchaser (x) shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return and
(y) shall not amend or revoke any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns (or
any notification or election relating thereto) without the prior written
consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). At Sellers request, Purchaser shall file, or cause
to be filed, any amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns. Purchaser shall
promptly provide (or cause to be provided) to Sellers any information
reasonably requested by Sellers to facilitate the preparation and filing of
any Tax Returns described in this  _Section 10.04(a)_ and Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare (or cause to be prepared) such
information in a manner and on a timeline requested by Sellers, which
information and timeline shall be consistent with the past practice of the
Transferred Companies.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 10.04(a)_, to
the extent any Combined Tax Return or Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return
includes any Tax items for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section
10.02(a)_ (an " _Interim Tax Return_ "), Sellers shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to Purchaser for its review and comment (x) in the case of any
Interim Tax Return that is a Pre-Closing Separate Return, a copy of such
Interim Tax Return and (y) in the case of any Interim Tax Return that is a
Combined Tax Return, a pro forma statement setting forth in sufficient detail
any information relevant for determining the amount of Taxes shown as due on
such Combined Return for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section
10.02(a)_, (i) with respect to income Taxes, at least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any
extensions), and (ii) with respect to non-income Taxes, as promptly as
reasonably practicable prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account any extensions), in each case, accompanied by a statement
calculating in reasonable detail Purchasers indemnification obligation with
respect thereto, if any, pursuant to  _Section 10.02(a)_ (" _Interim Taxes_
"). If Purchaser does not agree with any item on such Interim Tax Return (or
pro forma statement, in the case of an Interim Tax Return that is a Combined
Return) that impacts the calculation of Interim Taxes or with Sellers
calculation of Interim Taxes, Purchaser shall notify Sellers of such
disagreement (A) in the case of a disagreement with respect to income Taxes,
within ten (10) days of Purchasers receipt of a copy of the Interim Tax
Return (or pro forma statement, as applicable) and Sellers calculation and
(B) in the case of a disagreement with respect to non-income Taxes, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after Purchasers receipt of a copy of the
Interim Tax Return (or portion thereof, as applicable) and Sellers
calculation, and in any event prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return. If a notice of objection shall be so delivered, Sellers and Purchaser
shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve the dispute. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
dispute within (I) in the case of a dispute with respect to income Taxes, ten
(10) days, and (II) in the case of a dispute with respect to non-income Taxes,
five (5) days (or such shorter period as may then exist prior to the due date
of the Interim Tax Return), in each case after receipt by Sellers of such
notice of objection, the disputed items shall

 



149  be resolved by the Independent Accountant and any determination by the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on Sellers,
Purchaser, the Transferred Companies and their respective Affiliates. The
Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items as promptly as
reasonably practicable after having the item referred to it, and in all events
at least two (2) days (or such shorter period as may then exist) prior to the
due date of such Interim Tax Return (taking into account any extensions),
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. Sellers shall file the Interim
Tax Return in accordance with the determination by the Independent Accountant.
The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Sellers. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law), Sellers
shall not amend or revoke any such Interim Tax Returns (or with respect to any
Interim Tax Return that is a Combined Tax Return, any portion of such Interim
Tax Return relating to Tax items for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant
to _Section 10.02(a)_) (or any notification or election relating thereto)
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Sellers shall file, or
cause to be filed, at Purchasers request, any amended Interim Tax Returns
(other than any such Interim Tax Returns that are Combined Tax Returns);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if either of Sellers or Purchaser desires to
amend or revoke any Interim Tax Return, the process of amending or revoking
such Interim Tax Return shall be subject to review, comment and dispute
resolution procedures as described in this _Section
10.04(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (C)
none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to receive a copy
of any Combined Tax Return (or any portion thereof) and (D) none of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to dispute any item on an Interim
Tax Return (or pro forma statements, as applicable) delivered by Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 10.04(b)_ that does not impact the calculation of
any Tax item for any Interim Tax Period for which Purchaser is responsible
pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_.

(c) Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Sellers pursuant to
_Section 10.04(a)_, Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred
Companies. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Closing Date Straddle
Period (a " _Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare
or cause to be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Transferred Companies, except as otherwise required by a
change in applicable Law. Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers for their review
and comment a copy of each such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return (i) with
respect to income Taxes, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions) and (ii) with
respect to non-income Taxes, as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions),
in each case, accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail
Sellers indemnification obligation with respect thereto, if any, pursuant to
_Section 10.01(a)_. If Sellers do not agree with any item on such Straddle
Period Separate Tax Return or with Purchasers calculation of Sellers
indemnification obligation, Sellers shall notify Purchaser of such
disagreement (i) in the case of a disagreement with respect to income Taxes,
within ten (10) days of Sellers receipt a copy of the Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return and Purchasers calculation and (ii) in the case of a
disagreement with respect to non-income Taxes, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after Sellers receipt of a copy of the Straddle Period Separate
Tax Return and Purchasers calculation, and in any event prior to the due date
for filing such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return. If a notice of objection
shall be so 

 



150  delivered, Sellers and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute. If Sellers and
Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute within (i) in the case of a
dispute with respect to income Taxes, ten (10) days, and (ii) in the case of a
dispute with respect to non-income Taxes, five (5) days (or such shorter
period as may then exist prior to the due date of the Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return), in each case after receipt by Purchaser of such notice
of objection, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive on Sellers, Purchaser, the Transferred
Companies and their respective Affiliates. The Independent Accountant shall
resolve any disputed items as promptly as reasonably practicable after having
the item referred to it, and in all events at least two (2) days (or such
shorter period as may then exist) prior to the due date of such Straddle
Period Separate Tax Return (taking into account any extensions), pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. Purchaser shall file the Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return in accordance with the determination by the Independent
Accountant. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne equally by Purchaser and Sellers. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law),
Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any such Straddle Period Separate
Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating thereto) without the
prior written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Purchaser shall file, or cause to be
filed, at Sellers request, any amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if either of Sellers or Purchaser desires to
amend or revoke any Straddle Period Separate Tax Return, the process of
amending or revoking such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return shall be
subject to review, comment and dispute resolution procedures as described in
this _Section 10.04(c)_.

 

Section 10.05 _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

 

(a) Sellers shall be entitled to any refund, credit or offset actually
received or realized by (i) Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies following the Closing) of or for any Taxes for which
Sellers are responsible under _Section 10.01(a)_or (ii) Reinsurer or any of
its Affiliates of or for any Taxes for which Sellers are responsible under
_Section 10.01(b)_, in either case, including any such amount arising by
reason of an amended Tax Return filed after the Closing Date or any audit
adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) occurring after the
Closing Date, but excluding any such amount taken into account as an asset on
the Final Balance Sheet. In connection with the foregoing, if Sellers
reasonably determine that the Transferred Companies are entitled to file or
make a formal or informal claim for a refund of Taxes (including by filing an
amended Tax Return) with respect to a Pre-Balance Sheet Date Tax Period,
Sellers shall be entitled to file or make, or to request that Purchaser cause
the Transferred Companies to file or make, such formal or informal claim for
refund, and Sellers shall be entitled to control of the prosecution of such
claim for refund. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and cause the
Transferred Companies to reasonably cooperate, with respect to such claim for
refund (including, if applicable, with respect to the filing or making of such
claim for refund), and shall pay, or cause the Transferred Companies to pay,
to Sellers the amount (including any interest paid thereon by the applicable
Taxing Authority and net of any costs or expenses (including Taxes) incurred
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to such refund or claim for
refund) of any related refund, credit, or offset thereof. In the event that
any such refund, credit, or offset (or portion thereof) in respect of which
Sellers have received a

 



151  payment from Purchaser or Reinsurer or any of their respective Affiliates
pursuant to this _Section 10.05(a)_ is subsequently disallowed, Sellers shall
pay Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, the amount of such disallowed
refund, credit, or offset, together with any interest, penalties, or
additional amounts imposed by the relevant Taxing Authority in respect of such
refund, credit, or offset (or portion thereof). Any refund, credit, or offset
received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the Transferred
Companies for a Balance Sheet Date Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned among Purchaser and Sellers in a manner consistent with the
principles set forth in _Section 10.03_. Purchaser or Reinsurer, as
applicable, shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to Sellers the amount
of any such refund, credit, or offset to which Sellers are entitled pursuant
to this  _Section 10.05(a)_ (including any interest paid thereon and net of
any costs or expenses (including Taxes) incurred by Purchaser or Reinsurer, as
applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to such refund,
credit, offset or claim for refund, credit, or offset) within ten (10) days
after the actual receipt thereof or the application of such Tax refund,
credit, or offset against amounts otherwise payable. Purchaser and Reinsurer,
respectively, shall be entitled to any refund, credit or offset actually
received or realized by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates of or
for any Taxes for which Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, is responsible
under _Section 10.02_, including any such amount arising by reason of an
amended Tax Return filed on or prior to the Closing Date or any audit
adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date, but excluding any such amount received in respect of a
Tax taken into account as a liability on the Final Balance Sheet.

(b) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Companies to carry forward, where
permitted by applicable Law, any item of loss, deduction or credit which
arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (a " _Subsequent
Loss_ ") into any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. If
a Subsequent Loss is not permitted by applicable Law to be carried forward
into any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
cooperate with Purchaser and the relevant Transferred Companies in seeking
from the appropriate Taxing Authority such Tax refund or other credit as
reasonably would result from a carry back of such Subsequent Loss into any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, to the extent that such
refund or other credit is directly attributable to such Subsequent Loss, and
the amount of such refund or other credit shall be paid to Purchaser within
ten (10) days after the actual receipt thereof or the application of such Tax
refund or other credit against amounts otherwise payable.

 

Section 10.06 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt
notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under
this  _Article X_, except to the extent that the other party is materially
prejudiced by such failure (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction). Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for
such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

 



152 (b) Subject to _Section 10.15_ and _Section 13.10_, in the case of a
Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the Transferred Companies for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section
10.06(d)_), Sellers shall have the exclusive right to control such Tax
Proceeding;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) to the extent such Tax
Proceeding relates to Tax items for any Interim Tax Period for which Purchaser
is responsible under _Section 10.02(a)_, (A) Sellers shall consult with
Purchaser before taking any significant action (including submitting written
materials) in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (B) Sellers shall defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party
in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (C) Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or
conferences with the relevant Taxing Authority and (D) Sellers shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) Sellers shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise or
abandonment could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries for any Post-Balance Sheet Date Tax
Period. Sellers may elect in writing not to control any Tax Proceeding that
Sellers otherwise have the right to control pursuant to the preceding
sentence. If Sellers make such election with respect to a Tax Proceeding,
Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such
Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal and accounting fees, incurred by
Purchaser in controlling such Tax Proceeding shall be borne by Sellers and (B)
Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding in good faith and shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on Sellers or any of
their Affiliates.

(c) Subject to _Section 10.15_ and _Section 13.10_, the case of a Tax
Proceeding of or with respect to any of the Transferred Companies for any
Closing Date Straddle Period (other than a Tax Proceeding described in
_Section 10.06(d)_), Purchaser shall control the Tax Proceeding; _provided_
that (A) Purchaser shall consult with Sellers before taking any significant
action (including submitting written materials) in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (B) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in
good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (C) Sellers shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant Taxing
Authority and (D) Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax
Proceeding with respect to (A) any Tax Return of Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Companies); and (B) any Tax Return of
a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries (including any Combined Tax Return); _provided_ , _however_
, that Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser to the extent any such Tax
Proceeding involves any issues that could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and will (i)
discuss Sellers approach with respect to contesting such issues with
Purchaser and (ii) act in good faith with respect to such issues.

 



153 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.06_, neither
Purchaser nor Sellers shall settle, compromise or abandon any Tax Proceeding
that Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, control pursuant to this _Section
10.06_ if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could be reasonably
expected to materially increase the Taxes of Reinsurer without the consent of
Reinsurer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 10.06(e)_ shall not
apply with respect to any such Tax Proceeding with respect to any Combined
Tax Return or any income Tax Return of Purchaser, Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates.

 

Section 10.07 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Not more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of a request from Sellers,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Sellers a
package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers,
reasonably requested by Sellers to enable Sellers to prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be prepared and filed by them with respect to the
Transferred Companies or Barco ( _provided_ , that with respect to any Tax
Return required to be prepared and filed by Sellers with respect to Barco for
a Post-Closing Tax Period, Purchasers obligations under this _Section
10.07(a)_ shall be limited to Tax information materials with respect to
annuity Policies written by the Company for which Barco is the Policy-owner).
Purchaser shall prepare such package in good faith and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare such package in a manner consistent with
Sellers past practice in all material respects.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other parties to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability
for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this _Article X_ or a right to
refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant
portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and
other information, which any such party may possess. Each party shall make its
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost
to provide an explanation of any documents or information so provided. Each
party to this Agreement shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date until the later of (A) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (B) seven (7) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other party reasonable notice
and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at
such other partys own expense. For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants and
agreements in this _Section 10.07(b)_ shall apply to the provision of
cooperation, documentation and information with respect to, and to the
retention of Tax Returns and other records and documents relating to Tax
matters with respect to, Barco;

 



154   _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period
of Barco, the obligations set forth in this _Section 10.07(b)_ shall be
limited to the provision of cooperation, documentation and information with
respect to, and the retention of Tax Returns and other records and documents
relating to Tax matters with respect to, annuity Policies written by the
Company for which Barco is the Policy-owner.

 

Section 10.08 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or before the Closing Date, the
rights and obligations of the Transferred Companies pursuant to all Tax
sharing agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to
which any of the Transferred Companies, on the one hand, and Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Companies), on the other hand,
are parties, shall terminate, and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates
nor any of the Transferred Companies shall have any rights or obligations
thereunder after the Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

 

Section 10.09 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. The parties agree that any payments
between the parties pursuant to  _Article II_ and any indemnification
payments made by Sellers, Purchaser or Reinsurer, as applicable, under this
_Article X_ or _Article XIII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price or the Ceding Commission, as applicable, for Tax purposes to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 10.10 _Additional Actions_. Except as otherwise expressly permitted
by this _Article X_ or _Section 13.10_, neither Purchaser nor Reinsurer
shall, or shall cause or permit any other Person to (a) file any ruling
request with any Taxing Authority that relates to any Tax or Tax Return of or
with respect to a Transferred Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (b) extend
or waive the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Tax or Tax
Return of or with respect to a Transferred Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period; or (c) provide any disclosure to, or engage in any discussions with,
any Taxing Authority solely regarding any Tax or Tax Return of or with respect
to a Transferred Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; in each case without
the prior written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 10.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Tax imposed
on or payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, other than the
transactions contemplated by _Section 8.14_. The party responsible under
applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and shall timely pay all
Transfer Taxes shown as due thereon (subject to such preparing partys rights
to indemnification from the non-preparing party for the non-preparing partys
portion of such Transfer Taxes) and shall promptly provide a copy of such Tax
Return to the other party. Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns
or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for
exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes.

 



155 Section 10.12 _Timing of Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be made
pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be made within ten (10) days after the

case earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

Section 10.13 _Tax Matters Coordination and Survival_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, indemnification with respect to
Taxes and the procedures relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by
this _Article X_ and the provisions of _Article XIII_ (other than _Section
13.01_, the hanging paragraph of _Section 13.02_, the hanging paragraph of
_Section 13.03_, and _Section 13.08(g)_, _(i)_ , _(j)_ and _(k),_ and, with
respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.19_ and _Section 5.16_, _Section 13.10_) shall not apply.

jointly make and file a timely and irrevocable election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under any applicable
state and local Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Company Shares
and the capital stock of the Company Subsidiary pursuant to this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_").

(b) Sellers shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally
determined pursuant to _Article II_, and together with other relevant
amounts, including Liabilities deemed assumed for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes) (the " _Total Consideration_ "), which shall be allocated (i) among
the Company Shares, the Acquired Group Benefits Assets and the Acquired Life
Assets in a manner consistent with (A) Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) the Final Section
338(h)(10) Calculation, and (ii) pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections,
the assets of the Transferred Companies as required pursuant to and in a
manner consistent with Sections 1060 and 338(h)(10) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and in a manner consistent with
the Final Section 338(h)(10) Calculation (collectively, the " _Allocation_ ").
Sellers shall deliver such Allocation to Purchaser within sixty (60) days
after the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.11_
(or, to the extent the Remaining Disputed Items are relevant to the
Allocation, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the determination
of the Final Section 338(h)(10) Calculation). Concurrently therewith, Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser supporting documentation setting forth the basis
for the Allocation, including work papers and any outside valuation reports
with respect to the Allocation. Purchaser shall have the right to review such
Allocation and, to the extent Purchaser disagrees with the Allocation,
Purchaser shall notify Sellers in writing of any objections within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such Allocation. Purchaser and Sellers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts.
The Allocation, as prepared by Sellers if no timely Purchaser objection has
been given or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or a
decision by the Independent Accountant in accordance with the following
sentence (the " _Final Allocation_ ") shall be final and binding on all
parties and any of their Affiliates. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the Allocation within twenty (20) days after the
receipt by Sellers of Purchasers timely objection, then Sellers and Purchaser
shall submit all such disputed items for resolution to the Independent
Accountant, whose decision shall be final and binding upon all parties and any
of their Affiliates and whose fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the
parties. Post-Closing adjustments pursuant to _Article II_ and other post-
Closing adjustments, if any, to the Total Consideration shall be allocated
among the assets to which the adjustments relate.

 



156 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and
schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including
IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 and any similar forms under applicable state and local
Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_") and any other Tax
Returns required to be filed in connection with the allocations set forth in
the Final Allocation, including IRS Form 8594 and any similar forms under
applicable state and local Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 1060
Forms_"), in each case in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation,
unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law). Purchaser and Sellers shall, or shall cause their relevant
Affiliates to, timely file the Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable
Taxing Authorities.

 

(d) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and
other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the Section
338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state or
local Tax Law) or any successor provisions. Sellers and Purchaser agree that
neither of them shall, or shall permit any of their Affiliates to, revoke the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections following the filing of the Section 338(h)(10)
Forms without the prior written consent of the other party.

(e) Sellers and Purchaser shall and shall cause their Affiliates to (i)
timely file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the Section 338(h)(10) Forms, the Section 1060 Forms and the Final
Allocation, if any, and (ii) take no position contrary thereto on any
applicable Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case,
except to the extent required to do otherwise pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Law). In the event that the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the Section 338(h)(10) Forms, the Section 1060 Forms or the Final
Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of
the dispute shall promptly notify the other party of the dispute.

(f) Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall deliver to the other party at the
Closing one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section
338(h)(10) Elections, which Sellers shall file, or cause to be filed, with the
IRS not later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.

(g) The parties agree to treat the reinsurance transactions as occurring at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-1(d) for all Tax purposes.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers and Purchaser (i)
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including filing such additional forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the
election contemplated by Section 1.848-2(g)(8) of the Treasury Regulations to
determine specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the deemed
assumption reinsurance transactions treated as occurring pursuant to the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections without regard to the general deductions
limitation of Section 848(c)(1) of the Code (the " _DAC Tax Election_ "),
which DAC Tax Election shall be effective for the taxable year of each party
that includes the Closing Date and for all subsequent taxable years during
which this Agreement remains in effect and (ii) shall not take, or permit any
of their Affiliates to take, any action to revoke the DAC Tax Election. The
terms used in this _Section 10.15(a)_ are defined by reference to Section
1.848-2 of the Treasury Regulations and Section 848 of the Code, each as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each of Sellers and Purchaser agrees
to, or to cause its applicable Affiliates to, (A) attach to its or such
Affiliates, as applicable, U.S. federal income tax return filed for the
first taxable year ending after the DAC Tax Election becomes effective (and
each year thereafter) a schedule that identifies the transactions treated as
occurring pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) as the subject of the DAC Tax
Election, (B) file its or such Affiliates, as applicable, respective U.S.
federal income tax returns in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.848-2 and (C) in the case of the party with
the net positive consideration with respect to the transactions treated as
occurring pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections for each taxable year,
capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the
transactions treated as occurring pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections
without regard to the general deductions limitation of Section 848(c)(1) of
the Code. To ensure consistency of reporting between the applicable parties
or as otherwise required by the Internal Revenue Service, Sellers and
Purchaser agree to, and to cause their respective Affiliates to, exchange
information pertaining to the amount of net consideration deemed to be paid
pursuant to the transactions treated as occurring pursuant to the Section
338(h)(10) Elections.

(b) Subject to  _Section 10.06(d)_, Purchaser shall control any Tax
Proceeding with respect to the DAC Tax Election, _provided_ , that (A)
Purchaser shall consult with Sellers before taking any significant action
(including submitting written materials) in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (B) Purchaser shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in
good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (C) Sellers shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences with the IRS and (D)
Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that such
Tax Proceeding results in the disallowance of the DAC Tax Election, Sellers
shall indemnify Purchaser for the decrease (if any) that would have resulted
to the Final Section 338(h)(10) Elections Adjustment Amount in light of such
disallowance.

Section 10.16 _Miscellaneous Covenants_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that (i) prior to the deemed liquidation of the Transferred
Companies resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, the Transferred
Companies shall retain any deferred items of income or loss it may have as a
result of Section 13517 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (HR 1) (or any successor
provision of applicable law) and (ii) the Tax resulting from such items as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be addressed
pursuant to _Section 2.14_.

action by any of the parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.01(e)_ shall not be available

not been reversed within twenty (20) Business Days such that the conditions in

Section 12.02 _Procedure on Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Sellers, Purchaser or Reinsurer pursuant to  _Section 12.01_,

Section 13.02 _Sellers  Indemnification of Purchaser_. From and after the
Closing, and subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article XIII_,
Sellers, on a several and not joint basis, shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
successors and assigns (" _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from any and all
Losses to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy by such Seller of a Sellers Fundamental
Representation;

(b) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ (other than a Sellers

indemnification in respect of _Section 4.04_, _Section 4.06_, or, to the
extent relating to _Section 5.03_ or _Section 5.05_,  _Section 4.32_, may

Closing Balance Sheet has been finally determined pursuant to _Article II_.
No party shall be entitled to recover any Losses for a claim made pursuant to
this _Section 13.02_ or _Section 10.01(a)_ to the extent that the underlying
facts supporting such claim were affirmatively raised by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party in connection with a claim resolved in accordance with the
final determination of the Final Statements pursuant to _Article II_ and such
claim is not supported by any material new facts or circumstances. No claim
for indemnification may be brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to _Section 13.02(b)_ in respect of a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation deemed set forth in _Section 4.32_ to the extent that the
basis for such claim for indemnification is the subject of a claim
for indemnification that is arising out of substantially the same facts and
circumstances and that has already been initiated pursuant to _Section
13.03(b)_ (I) by a Reinsurer Indemnified Party to the extent that Sellers
provide timely written notice thereof to such Purchaser Indemnified Party and
such Purchaser Indemnified Party had the opportunity to participate in such
Action or arbitration and was afforded the opportunity to be named as a party
or (II) by a Purchaser Indemnified Party (in its capacity as a Reinsurer
Indemnified Party).

Section 13.03 _Sellers  Indemnification of Reinsurer_. From and after the
Closing, and subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article XIII_,
Sellers shall, on a several and not joint basis, defend, indemnify and hold

(a) any breach or inaccuracy by such Seller of a Sellers Fundamental
Representation (other than any Sellers Fundamental Representation set forth
in _Section 4.01_);

(b) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller contained in  _Article III_ or _Article V_ (other than a Sellers
Fundamental Representation or any representation or warranty made by such
Seller in _Section 5.16_, which is governed by _Article X_ and  _Section
13.10_, or any representation or warranty made by Sellers in Section 5.06 with
respect to Actions or arbitrations that are initiated or threatened in writing
on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date);

 

(c) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of a Seller
to Reinsurer contained in this Agreement;

 

(d) any Excluded Life Liabilities; or

 



166 (e) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller contained in Section 5.06 with respect to Actions or arbitrations that
are initiated or threatened in writing on or after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing Date.

 

No claim for indemnification may be brought pursuant to this _Section 13.03_
by any party for any Losses comprising death benefits or similar
policy benefits or reserves with respect to Discovered Contracts (claims with
respect to such Losses shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 8.23_). No
claim for indemnification may be brought in respect of _Section 5.03_ or 
_Section 5.05_ pursuant to this _Section 13.03_ by any party until the Post-
Closing Settlement Report has been finally determined pursuant to _Article
II_. No party shall be entitled to recover any Losses for a claim made
pursuant to this _Section 13.03_ or _Section 10.01(b)_ to the extent that
the underlying facts supporting such claim were affirmatively raised by a
Reinsurer Indemnified Party in connection with a claim resolved in accordance
with the final determination of the Final Statements pursuant to _Article II_
and such claim is not supported by any material new facts or circumstances. In
addition, upon (x) the failure of the conditions set forth in  _Sections
11.02(g)_ and _11.02(h)_ (and Purchasers waiver of the same) and Reinsurers
failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including Reinsurers failure to enter into the Reinsurance Agreement at the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.07_), or (y) the occurrence of a Recapture
Event (as defined in the Reinsurance Agreement) under the Reinsurance
Agreement and the subsequent exercise by Purchaser of its right of recapture
thereunder, Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
successors and assigns shall be deemed to be Reinsurer Indemnified Parties
herein and shall be entitled to the rights, benefits and remedies set forth in
this  _Article XIII_ with respect to Reinsurer Indemnified Parties, subject
to the limitations on such rights, benefits and remedies set forth in this
_Article XIII_ (other than with respect to any Reinsured Contract novated
to Reinsurer pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (I) in no event shall Purchaser or its Affiliates, or their
respective Representatives, be entitled to recover more than once (as
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and as Reinsurer Indemnified Parties, or
otherwise) in respect of the same Loss and (II) no claim for indemnification
may be brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party (in its capacity as a
Reinsurer Indemnified Party) pursuant to  _Section 13.03(b)_ or _Section
10.01(b)(ii)_ to the extent that the basis for such claim for indemnification
is the subject of a related claim for indemnification that is arising out of
substantially the same facts and circumstances and that has already been
initiated pursuant _Section 13.02(b)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ in respect
of a breach or inaccuracy of any corresponding _Article V_ representation
deemed set forth in  _Section 4.32_ so long as the Purchaser Indemnified
Party (in its capacity as a Reinsurer Indemnified Party) received notice from
Seller of such claim, had the opportunity to participate in such Action or
arbitration and was afforded the opportunity to be named as a party in such
capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, upon Reinsurers failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including Reinsurers failure
to enter into the Reinsurance Agreement at the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.07_), no claim for indemnification may be brought by Reinsurer pursuant to
this _Section 13.03_ or _Section 10.01(b)_.

Representation);

to Sellers contained in this Agreement; or

until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section

(g) The amount of any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party shall be
reduced (i) by any amount received by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates with respect to and to the extent arising with respect to the same
Loss under any insurance or reinsurance coverage (including, in the case of a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement) relating
thereto or (ii) by any amount received by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates with respect thereto from any non-Affiliated Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not reduce the aggregate amount of a Loss recoverable by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Reinsurer Indemnified Parties,
collectively, under this Agreement, nor permit duplicative recovery by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Reinsurer Indemnified Parties for the same
Loss), in each of (i) and (ii) (x) net of any deductible, retention, costs or
other expenses actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
therewith and (y) only to the extent that the Indemnified Party would
otherwise retain an amount greater than the full amount of the Losses
sustained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the underlying claim. The
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
any amounts available under insurance policies or recoverable from non-
Affiliated Persons with respect to Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party.
If an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates receives any amounts under
insurance policies, or from any non-Affiliated Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, in each case in connection with a matter giving
rise to an indemnification payment, but subsequent to such indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense
incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates, in each case (I) net of any deductible, retention, costs
or other expenses actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
therewith and (II) only to the extent that the Indemnified Party would
otherwise retain an amount greater than the full amount of the Losses
sustained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the underlying claim.

(h) An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the amount of Losses upon and after becoming aware of any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder in which event such costs incurred by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 13.08(h)_ in connection with the
mitigation of an indemnifiable Loss shall constitute " _Losses_ " for purposes
of this  _Article XIII_.

(i) Any liability for indemnification to an Indemnified Party under this
Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by such
Indemnified Party by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement hereunder. In no event shall Sellers be liable to an
Indemnified Party or more than one Indemnified Party in respect of the same
portion of any Loss as measured from the perspective of the Company
disregarding the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit more than one Indemnified
Party from recovering different portions of the same Loss (for the avoidance
of doubt, the

 



171  different portions of the same Loss recoverable by the Indemnified Parties
shall in no event exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the Loss). For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) except with respect to indemnification pursuant to
_Article X_, no party shall be entitled to claim indemnification with respect
to the same Loss more than once and (y) no party shall be entitled to claim
indemnification pursuant to  _Article X_ with respect to the same Tax
liability more than once. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, (i) no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to any particular Loss to the extent the related
liability or obligation is specifically reflected on, provided for or reserved
against on the Final Balance Sheet and (ii) no Reinsurer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to any particular Loss to
the extent the related liability or obligation is specifically reflected on,
provided for or reserved against in the Final Statement of Net Settlement on
the basis provided for in the Statement of Net Settlement Methods.

(j) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no
inaccuracy or breach. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties, and the Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification with respect
thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations
and warranties of any other party set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party or any of its
Representatives or by reason of the fact that any of the Indemnified Parties
or any of such Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of
whether such investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) the waiver of any
condition by such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates set forth in
_Article XI_. 

(k) In determining the amount of any payment necessary to indemnify any party
hereto against, or reimburse any party for, Losses or Taxes pursuant to
_Article X_ or this _Article XIII_, the amount of such Losses or Taxes shall
be determined (i) net of any Tax benefit actually realized in cash (or through
the reduction of Taxes otherwise payable) by the Indemnified Party (or any
Affiliate thereof) in the taxable year in which such Loss or Tax is paid or
accrued, as the result of sustaining or paying such Losses or Taxes (including
as a result of facts or circumstances due to which the Indemnified Party
sustained or paid such Losses or Taxes) and (ii) gross of the amount of any
Taxes (on a grossed-up basis) or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or accrual of any such reduction in
Tax liability or indemnification payment ( _provided_ that for the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this _Section 13.08(k)_ shall affect the parties
agreement in _Section 10.09_ regarding the Tax treatment of payments).
The calculation described in the previous sentence shall be made by comparing
(x) the Taxes payable by such Person in respect of such taxable year without
giving effect to any deductions for the payment or accrual of the Loss or Tax
giving rise to the relevant indemnification payment and (y) the Taxes payable
by such Person in respect of such taxable year giving effect to such deduction
allowed as a result of such payment or accrual of such Loss or Tax and gross
of any Taxes and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with obtaining, receiving, or accruing such reduction in Tax
liability or the related

 



172  indemnification payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 13.08(k)_ shall be interpreted to require a party or any of its
respective Affiliates to show or provide all or a portion of its consolidated
U.S. federal income Tax Return to any other party or its respective
Affiliates.

 

Section 13.09 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) No Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification against any
Losses unless it has given to the party from whom indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written claim notice relating to such Losses
(a " _Claim Notice_ "). The Claim Notice shall be given reasonably promptly
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the facts indicating that a claim
for indemnification may be warranted and shall state in reasonable detail, to
the extent reasonably available at such time, the nature of the claim,
identify the sections of this Agreement which form the basis for such claim,
attach copies of all material written evidence thereof received from a third
party to the date of such notice and set forth the estimated amount of the
Losses that have been or may be sustained by an Indemnified Party relating to
such claim to the extent reasonably estimable. The failure of an Indemnified
Party to give a Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this  _Article XIII_, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give a Claim Notice. The
Indemnifying Party shall have no Liability with respect to any unreasonable
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party prior to the time the Claim
Notice is received by the Indemnifying Party.

(b) If a Claim Notice relates to a claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand
asserted by a non-Affiliated Person (or a successor thereof) (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may, through counsel of its own choosing (
_provided_ that in the event of any Third Party Claim asserted by any
Governmental Authority, such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party), assume the defense and investigation of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
in any such defense with counsel of its own choice at its own expense. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ one (1) separate counsel in
any such Third Party Claim and to participate (but not control) in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be
the expense of the Indemnifying Party unless (i) the employment of such
counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a
conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable or
(iii) one or more defenses are available to the Indemnified Party that are
not available to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of a Third Party Claim (x) for non-monetary remedies asserted by any
Governmental Authority that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
the Indemnified Party, or (y) for monetary damages where the amount in
controversy as claimed by a Governmental Authority exceeds two hundred
percent (200%) of the remaining amount potentially recoverable by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party after giving effect to the
limits on indemnification in _Section 13.08_ and all other
outstanding claims for indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to control the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim upon
written notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that (A) counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party, (B) the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the

 



173  Indemnifying Party ( _provided_ that such fees and expenses shall be limited
to commercially reasonable fees and expenses, and it being understood that the
Indemnified Party shall not at any time employ more than one (1) primary
counsel, more than one (1) local counsel in any jurisdiction and more than one
(1) specialty counsel in any subject matter in connection with such Third
Party Claim), (C) the Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any such Third Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment, except to the extent the sole
relief granted (I) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party or its Affiliates or any violation of the rights of any Person by or on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates and does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf
of any Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates, and (II) does not subject an
Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates to any injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy and does not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnifying
Party or its Affiliates or result in any restriction or condition that would
apply to and adversely affect any Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates or the
conduct of any Indemnifying Partys or its Affiliates respective businesses
and (D) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to employ one (1) separate

its sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any
pending or threatened Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any

Section 13.10 _Policy Tax Claims_.

 

(a) At any time prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties may bring a claim pursuant to  _Section
10.01(a)(vi)_ that relates to a breach of a representation or warranty under
_Section 4.19_, and the Reinsurer Indemnified Parties may bring a claim
pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ that relates to a breach of a
representation or warranty under _Section 5.16_, in each case even if no
related Third Party Claim has first been asserted or made against the
applicable Indemnified Party with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such claim with respect to which no Third Party Claim has previously
been asserted (a " _Direct Product Tax Claim_ ") must be based on the
reasonable and good faith determination by the applicable Indemnified Party
that a breach of a representation or warranty under _Section 4.19_ or
_Section 5.16_, as applicable, has occurred. In the event that, prior to the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, any Purchaser Indemnified Party
or Reinsurer Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstance that could
result in a Tax or Loss that would arise out of a breach of a representation
or warranty set forth in _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_, as applicable,
such Indemnified Party shall deliver to Sellers a notice describing such
circumstance with reasonable specificity, such breach of a representation or
warranty under _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_, as applicable, and the
nature of the potential Tax or Loss. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) prior to the termination of the five (5) year survival
period pursuant to _Section 13.01(e)_, Sellers shall only be required to
indemnify the applicable Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.01(a)(vi)_ or
_Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ for Losses or Taxes pursuant to a Direct Product Tax
Claim arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties made
in  _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_, as applicable, to the extent that
such Losses or Taxes arise out of a circumstance identified in a notice
delivered on or prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date
in accordance with the previous sentence (substituting "third (3rd)
anniversary" for "fifth (5th) anniversary") and (ii) in no event shall Sellers
be required to indemnify the applicable Indemnified Parties under  _Section
10.01(a)(vi)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ for Losses or Taxes arising out of
any breach of the representations and warranties made in _Section 4.19_ or
_Section 5.16_ in accordance with the terms hereof, as applicable, pursuant
to a Direct Product Tax Claim or Third Party Claim arising after the five (5)
year anniversary of the Closing Date (it being understood that if a Direct
Product Tax Claim or Third Party Claim is brought on or prior to the five (5)
year anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to a breach of a
representation or warranty under _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_ in
accordance with the terms hereof, the representations and warranties that are
the subject of such Direct Product Tax Claim or Third Party Claim shall
survive with respect to such Direct Product Tax Claim or Third Party Claim
solely for purposes of its resolution in accordance with the terms
hereof, including during the pendency of any request for ruling or closing
agreement as contemplated by this _Section 13.10_). For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 13.10_ shall, unless specifically provided
herein, limit or otherwise restrict the right of any Purchaser Indemnified
Party or Reinsurer Indemnified Party to be indemnified under _Article X_ for
Taxes or Losses described therein (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Taxes or Losses incurred with respect to a Third Party Claim).

 



175 (b) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Reinsurer Indemnified Party brings a
Direct Product Tax Claim, Sellers and the applicable Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in good faith to determine whether any breach of a representation or
warranty under _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_, as applicable, has
occurred. If, with respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim, Sellers and the
applicable Indemnified Party cannot agree as to whether a breach of a
representation or warranty under _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_, as
applicable, has occurred, then such disagreement shall be resolved by a
recognized law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm mutually agreeable to
the applicable Indemnified Party and Sellers, and any such determination by
such law firm, accounting firm, or actuarial firm shall be final. Such law
firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm shall render a determination within
sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter for resolution (" _Direct
Product Tax Claim Determination_ "). If the Direct Product Tax Claim
Determination is that a breach has occurred, (A) Sellers shall (x) be entitled
to promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days) notify the
applicable Indemnified Party that they intend to seek, and then to promptly
use reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain, a ruling or closing agreement
from the applicable Taxing Authority with respect to such Direct Product Tax
Claim and shall only be required to indemnify the applicable Indemnified
Party following receipt of, and then only to the extent of the Liability
under, such ruling or closing agreement, and (y) if Sellers decline in their
sole discretion to seek such a ruling or closing agreement, or withdraw or
fail to promptly use reasonable best efforts to pursue their request for such
ruling or closing agreement, Sellers shall indemnify the applicable
Indemnified Party with respect to such Direct Product Tax Claim and (B)
Sellers and the applicable Indemnified Party shall cooperate, if necessary,
to develop corrective measures with respect to such Direct Product Tax Claim
that are reasonable, practical, cost effective and efficacious, taking into
account all of the relevant facts and circumstances then applicable. In the
event Sellers have an obligation hereunder to indemnify an Indemnified Party
with respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim and Sellers and such Indemnified
Party cannot agree with respect to the appropriate reasonable,
practical, cost-effective and efficacious corrective measures, then such
disagreement with respect to the appropriate corrective measures shall be
resolved by a recognized law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm mutually
agreeable to the applicable Indemnified Party and Sellers, and any such
determination by such law firm, accounting firm, or actuarial firm shall be
final. Such law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm shall render a
determination within sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter for
resolution. The cost of engaging a law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm
pursuant to this _Section 13.10_ shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by the applicable Indemnified Party. Sellers
shall not be required seek a ruling or closing agreement, indemnify the
applicable Indemnified Party or participate in the development of any
corrective measures with respect to any Direct Product Tax Claim for which
the Direct Product Tax Claim Determination is that no breach has occurred
unless and until a Third Party Claim with respect thereto subsequently arises.
The Purchaser Indemnified Party or Reinsurer Indemnified Party, as applicable,
shall promptly reimburse Sellers for any amount paid to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Reinsurer Indemnified Party by Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 13.10(b)_ with respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim in the event
that there is a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code) with respect to the facts underlying such Direct Product Tax Claim that
(A) is final and unappealable and (B) conclusively establishes that Sellers
did not breach the representations and warranties on which such Direct
Product Tax Claim were based.

 



176 (c) In the event that the corrective measures described in this _Section
13.10_ with respect to any claim for indemnification for breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section 4.19_ or _Section 5.16_
include making any request to the IRS for relief with respect to such failure,
the applicable Indemnified Party and Sellers shall jointly participate in all
discussions or other proceedings with the IRS, including attendance at
meetings and joint approval of all written submissions. Sellers shall control
the decision of whether or not to enter into a closing agreement or other
arrangement with the IRS in connection with such discussions or other
proceedings (it being understood that such decision shall not limit or
otherwise restrict the right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Reinsurer
Indemnified Party to be indemnified under _Article X_ for Taxes or Losses
described therein), provided that if (i) the closing agreement or other
arrangement involves any admission that would reasonably be expected to
form the basis of the determination of any material future liability of,
nonmonetary relief against or commitments by such Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, or (ii) following the initiation of such discussions or other
proceedings with the IRS (other than discussions on a no-name basis), any
decision not to enter into a closing agreement or other arrangement would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on such Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, then Sellers may not enter into (or fail to
enter into, as applicable) any such closing agreement or other arrangement
without such Indemnified Partys prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Should the applicable
Indemnified Party decide to withhold its consent to Sellers entering into (or
failing to enter into, as applicable) any closing agreement or other
arrangement with the IRS, such Indemnified Party shall promptly communicate
such decision in writing to Sellers. The applicable Indemnified Party shall
control the implementation of any corrective measures described in this
_Section 13.10_.

 

Section 13.11 _Materiality_. For purposes of this _Article XIII_, any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty (other than the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.04_, _Section
4.08(b)_, _Section 5.03_, and _Section 5.07(b)_) and the amount of any
Losses resulting therefrom shall be determined without giving effect to any
exception or qualification in such representations and warranties relating to
"Material Adverse Effect," "material" or "materiality" in any such
representations and warranties. 

Section 13.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of actual fraud, and
subject to _Section 12.03_ and  _Section 14.10_, the parties acknowledge
and agree that, from and after the Closing (as to any party), their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims under or arising out of
this Agreement, including for any breach or non-fulfillment of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XIII_,
and with respect to Taxes, _Article X_ and the remedies of injunction and
specific performance to the extent available under _Section 14.10_;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event Reinsurer does not
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
entering into the Reinsurance Agreement), the Closing shall not be deemed to
have occurred as respects Reinsurer.

Section 14.03 _Waivers and Amendment_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified or waived if, and only if, such amendment, modification or
waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the parties,
or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York, without respect to its applicable principles of
conflicts of laws that might require the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
federal courts of the United States located in the Southern District of the
State of New York or, if such courts do not have jurisdiction, the state
courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (" _New
York Courts_ ") in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
including the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and
agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and
determined in the New York Courts, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement in
the New York Courts, including any objection based on its place of
incorporation or domicile, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action
in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties consents
and agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document for any action
permitted hereunder may be delivered by registered mail addressed to it at the
applicable address set forth in _Section 14.01_ or in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

Section 14.07 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE BASED UPON,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR
VALIDITY THEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES NOR ANY
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT IT WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS  _SECTION

OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



181 Section 14.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an original,
but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and may be
delivered by facsimile or other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic or pictorial appearance of a document.

Section 14.09 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability.
If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

 

Section 14.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any
such failure to perform or breach. It is accordingly agreed that, without
posting bond or other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to injunctive
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party will
allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there
is an adequate remedy at law. The parties further agree that (a) by seeking
any remedy provided for in this _Section 14.10_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to such party under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this _Section
14.10_ shall require any party to institute any action for (or limit such
partys right to institute any action for) specific performance under this
_Section 14.10_ before exercising any other right under this Agreement.

 

Section 14.11 _Publicity_. Any press release or press releases with respect to
the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements shall be in a form mutually agreed by the parties.
Thereafter, until the Closing, no public release or announcement concerning
such transactions shall be issued by any party or its Affiliates without
the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release
or announcement shall, to the extent practicable, allow the other parties
reasonable time to reasonably review and comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each
of the parties may make (a) internal announcements to their respective
employees that are not inconsistent with the parties prior public disclosure
regarding the transaction, (b) announcements to the investment community and
communications with its agents or rating agencies, in each case that are not
inconsistent with the parties prior public disclosures regarding the
transaction, (c) such other public communications to the extent reasonably
necessary in order perform its obligations and to enforce its rights and
remedies under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or (d) as may be
required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange.

 



182 Section 14.12 _No Other Representations and Warranties; Due Investigation_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_,
_Article IV_ and _Article V_, none of Sellers or their Affiliates, nor any
