AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 26, 2017 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Heritage Financial Corporation, a Washington corporation ("
_Heritage"_ ), and Puget Sound Bancorp, Inc. a Washington corporation ("
_Puget Sound_ ", and together with Heritage, the " _Parties"_ ).

  

RECITALS

  

A. The Boards of Directors of the Parties have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to
consummate the business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement
in which Puget Sound will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Heritage (the " _Merger_ "), with
Heritage as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  

B. As a condition to the willingness of Heritage to enter into this Agreement,
all of the directors and executive officers of Puget Sound have entered into
voting agreements (each a " _Voting Agreement_ "), substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , dated as of the date hereof, with Heritage.

  

C. As a condition to the willingness of Heritage to enter into this Agreement,
all of the directors of Puget Sound have entered into resignation, non-compete
and confidentiality agreements (each a " _Non-Compete Agreement_ "),
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ B, dated as of the date
hereof but effective upon consummation of the Merger, with Heritage.

  

E. The Parties intend the Merger to be treated as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and intend for this Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

  

F. The Parties desire to make certain covenants, representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as
follows:

    

  


 

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  THE MERGER

  

1.1 _The Merger_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Washington Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ "), at the Effective
Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_ ), Puget Sound shall merge with and into
Heritage. Heritage shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall
continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of
Washington. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Puget Sound shall cease.

  

(b) Subject to the consent of Puget Sound, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, Heritage may at any time change the method of effecting
the combination (including by providing for the merger of a wholly owned
subsidiary of Heritage with Puget Sound) if and to the extent requested by
Heritage; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter
or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as defined in
_Section 1.4(b)_ ) to be received by the shareholders of Puget Sound, (ii)
adversely affect the tax consequences of the Merger to the shareholders of
Puget Sound or the tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement or
(iii) impede or materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
simultaneously with the Closing (as defined in _Section 9.1_ ), the Parties
shall execute, and Heritage shall cause to be filed with Secretary of State of
the State of Washington (the " _Secretary of State_ "), articles of merger and
a short form plan of merger as provided in the WBCA (collectively the "
_Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such time as
designated in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the WBCA.

  

1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Puget Sound, Heritage or the holders of any
of the following securities:

  

(a) _Heritage Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value, of
Heritage (" _Heritage Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving
Company.

  

(b) _Puget Sound Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 1.4(c) and 1.4(d)_ , each
share of common stock, no par value, of Puget Sound (" _Puget Sound Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares (as such terms are
defined in _Section 1.4(c)_ ), but excluding any Cancelled Shares (as defined
_Section 1.4(c)_ ) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 1.4(d)_ ),
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article
II_ , into the right to receive a number of shares of Heritage Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 1.4 (f)), subject to any
adjustments pursuant to _Section 1.4(e)_ , _Section 1.4(g)_ or _Section
8.1(h)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The aggregate number of shares of
Puget Sound Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including shares of restricted stock, shall not be greater
than 3,518,885 shares of Puget Sound Common Stock which is the number of
shares issued and outstanding on the date hereof inclusive of shares of
restricted stock. All of the shares of Puget Sound Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of Puget Sound Common Stock (each, an " _Existing
Certificate_ "),

  

    

  

(it being understood that any reference to an "Existing Certificate" shall be
deemed, as appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account statements
relating to the ownership of Puget Sound Common Stock, and it being further
understood that provisions herein relating to Existing Certificates shall be
interpreted in a manner that appropriately accounts for book-entry shares,
including that, in lieu of delivery of an Existing Certificate and a letter of
transmittal as specified herein, shares held in book-entry form may be
transferred by means of an "agent\'s message" to the Exchange Agent or such
other similar evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration including any cash in lieu of a fractional share interest into
which the shares of Puget Sound Common Stock represented by such Existing
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4 and Section
2.3(f)_ , as well as any dividends as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_.

  


 

  

(c) _Cancelled Shares_. Shares of Puget Sound Common Stock that are owned
immediately prior to the Effective Time by Puget Sound or Heritage (other than
shares of Puget Sound Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts,
mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, "
_Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Puget Sound Common
Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Puget Sound or Heritage in respect of a
debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares"_ ) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Heritage or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (any such shares, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ").

  

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all shares of Puget Sound Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who exercises dissenters rights when and in the manner required
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted with respect to the payment of the fair value of such
shares under the applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (and at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided for pursuant to the foregoing provisions of the WBCA and this
_Section 1.4(d)_ ), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to demand or receive the
fair value of such shares of Puget Sound Common Stock under the WBCA. If any
shareholder dissenting pursuant to the WBCA and this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holder\'s shares of Puget Sound Common Stock shall thereupon be treated
as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share of Puget Sound Common Stock, in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)_ ,
without any interest thereon. Puget Sound shall give Heritage (i) prompt
notice of any written notices to exercise dissenters\' rights in respect of
any shares of Puget Sound Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices
and any other instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and received by Puget
Sound relating to shareholders\' dissenters\' rights and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
fair value under the WBCA. Puget Sound shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Heritage, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent as (defined in _Section
2.1_ ) pursuant to _Article II_ to pay for shares of Puget Sound Common Stock
for which dissenters\' rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Heritage upon demand.

  


 

  

(e) _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Heritage Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other

    

  

similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate

Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.

  

2.2 _Heritage to Make Shares Available_. Prior to the Effective Time, Heritage
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration in the form of (a) certificates, or evidence of shares in book

any dividends or distributions with respect thereto payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_ , (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Heritage shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration.

  

2.3 _Exchange of Shares_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within ten (10) days thereafter), and subject to the receipt by the
Exchange Agent of a list of Puget Sound\'s shareholders in a format that is
reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of an Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to such Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates
(or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such Existing Certificate or
Existing Certificates in exchange for a New Certificate, any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Heritage Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)._

  


 

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after surrender to the Exchange Agent of
its Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates, accompanied by a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, such holder of Puget Sound Common Stock will
be entitled to receive a New Certificate, any cash in lieu of a fractional
share of Heritage Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.3(c)_ , in respect of the shares of Puget Sound Common Stock
represented by such holder\'s Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates.
Until so surrendered, such Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, a New Certificate, any cash

  

    

  

in lieu of a fractional share of Heritage Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Existing Certificate or Existing
Certificates in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Heritage Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Existing Certificate with
respect to the shares of Heritage Common Stock represented thereby, unless and
until the surrender of such Existing Certificate in accordance with this
_Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws, following surrender of any such Existing Certificate or
Existing Certificates in accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, and in addition to the
other amounts set forth herein, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to the whole shares of Heritage Common Stock represented by such
Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates and not paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to whole shares of Heritage Common Stock represented by
such Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates with a record date after
the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date
subsequent to the issuance of the Heritage Common Stock issuable with respect
to such Existing Certificate or Existing Certificates.

  


 

  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of an Existing Certificate
representing Puget Sound Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of Puget Sound, any New Certificate,
any cash in lieu of a fractional share of Heritage Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled, shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a
person other than the person in whose name the Existing Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Existing Certificate formerly representing
such Puget Sound Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in _Section 3.10(b)_
) required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the
registered holder of the Existing Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Heritage that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange
Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) six months after the Effective
Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement,
Heritage) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Heritage Common Stock or any other cash payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Puget Sound Common Stock such amounts as
the Exchange Agent or Heritage, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent or Heritage, as the case may be, and timely
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 3.4_
), such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of shares of Puget Sound Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent
or Heritage, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Puget Sound of the shares of Puget Sound Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Puget Sound Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Existing Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Heritage Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor, and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Article II_.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Heritage Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
of Existing Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with
respect to Heritage Common Stock shall be payable on or with

  

    

  

respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interest shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Heritage. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Heritage shall
pay to each former shareholder of Puget Sound who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Heritage Average Closing Price for the
Determination Period by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Puget Sound Common Stock held by such holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Heritage Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_.

  


 

  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Puget Sound at the expiration of six months after the
Effective Time shall be paid to Heritage. In such event, any former
shareholders of Puget Sound who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Heritage with respect to any New
Certificate, any cash in lieu of any fractional share interest and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Heritage Common Stock deliverable in
respect of the shares represented by an Existing Certificate such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Heritage, Puget
Sound, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Puget Sound Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  


 

  

(h) In the event any Existing Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Existing Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Heritage or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Heritage may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Existing
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Existing Certificate a New Certificate, any cash in lieu of any
fractional share interest and any dividends and distributions to which such
person is entitled in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

(i) If Heritage elects to pay a portion of the Merger Consideration in cash
pursuant to _Section 1.4(g),_ then Heritage shall, prior to the Effective
Time, provide to the Exchange Agent as part of the Exchange Fund cash in a
sufficient amount to fund the cash portion of the Merger Consideration to be
paid to the holders of Existing Certificates. In such event, the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration shall be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ ,
subject to any applicable Tax withholding, upon surrender of an Existing
Certificate or Existing Certificates.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE III 
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PUGET SOUND

  

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Puget Sound to
Heritage concurrently herewith (the " _Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule_ ");
provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to
a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Puget Sound
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in _Section 3.1(a)_ ) on Puget Sound and (c) any disclosures made
with respect to a section of _Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any
other section of _Article III_ specifically referenced or cross-referenced and
(2) other sections of _Article III_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent on
its face (notwithstanding the absence

  

    

  

of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections, Puget Sound hereby represents and
warrants to Heritage as follows:

  


 

  

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

  

(a) Puget Sound is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Washington, and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the " _BHC Act_ "). Puget Sound has the corporate power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets as presently owned, operated or
leased and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Puget Sound
is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Puget Sound. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Heritage, Puget Sound or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after
the date hereof, in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after
the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to
companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate,
or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
(including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest
rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, (D)
public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions or
inactions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (E) expenses reasonably incurred by a party in connection
with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (F) a decline in the trading price of a party\'s common stock or the
failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections, but not, in either
case, including the underlying causes thereof; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate), or (ii) the
ability of such party or its banking Subsidiary to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the articles of
incorporation of Puget Sound (the " _Puget Sound Articles_ ") and the bylaws
of Puget Sound (the " _Puget Sound Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by Puget Sound to
Heritage.

  


 

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Puget Sound (an " _Puget Sound Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, is in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Puget Sound and (iii) has all requisite power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the
Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule, there are no restrictions on the ability of
any Subsidiary of Puget Sound to pay dividends or distributions except for
statutory restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all entities of the same type and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is

  

    

  

a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of Puget Sound
Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ")
through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending
or threatened. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Puget Sound as of the
date hereof. Neither Puget Sound nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any equity
or profit-and-loss interest in any business enterprise, corporation,
partnership or joint venture, limited liability company, association, joint-
stock company, business trust or unincorporated organization, other than a
Subsidiary, readily marketable securities, securities held-to-maturity in its
investment portfolio, stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the "
_FHLB_ "), and stock in the Pacific Coast Bankers\' Bank. Puget Sound Bank is
not in material violation of any of its organizational documents.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Puget Sound consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Puget Sound Common Stock and 100,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value per share, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or
outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, there are (i) 3,424,934 shares
of Puget Sound Common Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 93,951 shares of
Puget Sound Common Stock subject to restriction under the outstanding Puget
Sound Restricted Stock Awards, and (iii) no other shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Puget Sound issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Puget Sound Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. There are no (A) bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of Puget Sound may vote or (B) trust preferred or subordinated
debt securities of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries issued or
outstanding. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating Puget Sound to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire, any shares of Puget Sound Common Stock or any other of
its securities. There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or
other agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of Puget
Sound Common Stock to which Puget Sound is a party. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the
Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list
of all Puget Sound Restricted Stock Awards outstanding as of the date hereof
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the
number of shares subject to each such Puget Sound Restricted Stock Award, and
(iii) the grant date and vesting dates of each such Puget Sound Restricted
Stock Award. Other than the Puget Sound Restricted Stock Awards set forth
above, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of
payment is determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital
stock of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

  


 

  

(b) Puget Sound owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Puget Sound Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to Puget Sound
Bank, as provided under applicable law) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Puget Sound
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

  


 

  

(c) Puget Sound does not have a dividend reinvestment plan or any
shareholders\' rights plan.

  


 

    

  

3.3 _Authority; No Violation._

  

(a) Puget Sound has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Puget Sound.
The Board of Directors of Puget Sound has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
Puget Sound and its shareholders and has directed that this Agreement be
submitted to Puget Sound\'s shareholders for approval at a meeting of such
shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Puget Sound Common Stock (the " _Puget
Sound Shareholder Approval_ "), no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Puget Sound are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Puget Sound and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by

(a) Each of Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed

affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a

the Taxes of any person or entity (other than Puget Sound or any of its
Subsidiaries) under U.S. Department of the Treasury

  

    

  

(" _Treasury_ ") Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise. Neither Puget Sound nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within

may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither Puget Sound nor any
of its Subsidiaries has filed an election under Section 338(g) or 338(h)(10)

or agreements, collectively, the " _Puget Sound Benefit Plans_ ").

  


 

  

(b) Puget Sound has heretofore made available to Heritage true and complete

requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither
Puget Sound nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, United States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity
with respect to any Puget Sound Benefit Plan, and neither Puget Sound nor any

for correction under any such program.

  


 

  

(d) _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Puget Sound Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code (collectively, the " _Puget Sound Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has
issued a favorable determination letter, or an opinion letter for a prototype
or volume submitter plan upon which Puget Sound may rely, with respect to each
Puget Sound Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been
revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Puget
Sound, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any Puget Sound Qualified Plan
or the related trust or increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding
any Puget Sound Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

  


 

  

(e) Each Puget Sound Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS

subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
or any tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA). No Puget Sound Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present
value of accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan
assets.

Affiliate has, ever contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan
that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), a plan that is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Welfare Arrangement_ "), or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of Puget
Sound and its Subsidiaries nor any Puget Sound ERISA Affiliate has incurred

insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries
or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

  


 

    

  

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Puget Sound Benefit Plan by

Puget Sound Benefit Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid, have been fully reflected on the books
and records of Puget Sound.

  


 

  

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Puget Sound, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Puget Sound\'s
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against any Puget Sound Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to a Puget Sound Benefit Plan or the
assets of any of trust under any Puget Sound Benefit Plans which could
reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Puget Sound or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a Puget Sound Benefit Plan, or any other
party.

  


 

  

(k) None of Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries nor any Puget Sound ERISA

of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  


 

  

(l) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(l)_ of the Puget Sound Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the
right of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Puget Sound Benefit Plan or related
trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by Puget
Sound or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or will not be
deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither Puget Sound nor any of
its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding
vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or
require Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to establish or

against Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Puget Sound nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Puget Sound, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group
seeking to represent any employees of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

    

  

(n) Neither Puget Sound nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to
employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Puget Sound
Benefit Plans.

  


 

  

(o) No condition exists as a result of which Puget Sound or any of its
Subsidiaries would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under
any Puget Sound benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person
performing services for Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals
participating in the Puget Sound Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and
authorized to participate in such Puget Sound Benefit Plan.

_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related

Heritage, and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article
IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article IV_

company duly registered under the BHC Act. Heritage has the corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets as presently
owned, operated or leased and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Heritage. True and complete copies of the articles of
incorporation of Heritage (the " _Heritage Articles_ ") and the bylaws of
Heritage (the " _Heritage Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this

property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Heritage, and (iii) has all requisite power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its

present in accordance with GAAP the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of

inaccuracies or discrepancies contained or reflected therein. Crowe Horwath

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Heritage nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability, obligation or loss contingency of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due) that is required to be reflected or reserved against on a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for those liabilities,
obligations or loss contingencies that are reflected or reserved against on
the consolidated balance sheet of Heritage included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 (including any notes

of Heritage or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Heritage. Heritage (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Heritage, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of Heritage by others within those entities as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Heritage\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of Heritage\'s Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

adversely affect Heritage\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Heritage\'s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Heritage\'s auditors and audit committee and
a copy has previously been made available to Puget Sound. There is no reason
to believe that Heritage\'s outside auditors and its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries has

  

    

  

engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney

that is within forty (40) days after the notice date; (ii) subject to _Section
6.8_ , use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (x) cause the Puget
Sound Shareholder Meeting to be convened and held on the scheduled date and
(y) obtain the Puget Sound Shareholder Approval; and (iii) subject to _Section
6.8_ , include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation that the Puget Sound
shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Puget Sound Board
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Puget Sound shall not be required to hold the Puget Sound
Shareholder Meeting if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_
prior to the scheduled time of the Puget Sound Shareholder Meeting.

  

6.4 _Reservation of Common Stock; Nasdaq Listing_.

  

(a) Heritage agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the
Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of
shares of Heritage Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

(b) Heritage shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Heritage Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Puget Sound
Common Stock in the Merger to be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Following the Effective Time, Heritage shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees of Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
(" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits and compensation
programs which are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation programs that are made available to similarly situated employees
of Heritage or its Subsidiaries (other than Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries),
as applicable; provided that (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be
eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Heritage or its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as Heritage shall cause Covered
Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation opportunities
that are made available to similarly situated employees of Heritage or its
Subsidiaries (other than Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries), a Covered
Employee\'s continued participation in employee benefit plans and

    

  

 

compensation programs of Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries that are continued
by Heritage or a Heritage Subsidiary shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing
provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the
Heritage Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each
Heritage Benefit Plan).

  

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Heritage Benefit Plan, Heritage shall cause such Heritage Benefit Plan to (i)
recognize years of prior service from the date of most recent hire of such
Covered Employee with Puget Sound, its Subsidiaries or their predecessors for
purposes of eligibility, participation, and vesting but not for the purposes
of benefit accruals, but only to the extent that such service was recognized
immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Puget Sound Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service shall
not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to
the same period of service; (ii) with respect to any Heritage Benefit Plan
that is a health, dental, vision plan or other similar plan in which any
Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Heritage or its applicable
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any
pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Heritage or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee
to the extent such condition was or would have been covered under the Puget
Sound Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (B) recognize any health, dental, vision or
other similar expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
health, dental, vision or other welfare plan; and (iii) for purposes of
vacation or paid time off (" _PTO_ ") benefits, service accrued with Puget
Sound from the most recent hire date with Puget Sound, its Subsidiaries or
their predecessors shall be credited for determining a Covered Employee\'s
eligibility and length of vacation or PTO under the Heritage vacation or PTO
plan, and any vacation or PTO taken prior to the Closing Date (or such later
date when PTO plans or programs are integrated) shall be subtracted under the
Heritage plan from the Covered Employee\'s vacation or PTO entitlement for the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Puget Sound shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably requested by Heritage that may be
necessary or appropriate to (i) cause the continuation on and after the
Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to
any Puget Sound Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by Heritage,
(ii) facilitate the merger of any Puget Sound Benefit Plan into any employee
benefit plan maintained by Heritage or a Heritage Subsidiary, and/or (iii)
amend or terminate one or more Puget Sound Benefit Plans (to the extent
permitted by the terms thereof and Section 409A of the Code) immediately prior
to the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices, or other documents issued,
adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this _Section
6.5(c)_ shall be subject to Heritage\'s prior review and approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

  

(d) Heritage agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, any full time Covered Employee
who is terminated without cause during such one-year period and who is not
otherwise subject to an employment agreement, change in control agreement, or
severance agreement benefits will be provided with severance benefits as
described in _Section 6.5(d)_ of the Heritage Disclosure Schedule.

  


 

  

(e) Each employee of Puget Sound or its Subsidiaries who is a party to an
employment, change in control or severance agreement who is expected to be
retained following the Effective Time has,

    

  

  

as of the date of this Agreement (or with respect to certain such employees,
shall have prior to the Effective Time), entered into a new employment, change
in control or severance agreement with Heritage or a Heritage Subsidiary which
shall become effective at the Effective Time and supersede the existing
employment, change in control or severance agreement. All other employment,
change in control and severance agreements listed in _Section 3.11(a)_ of the
Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule and the benefits vested under the other Puget
Sound Benefit Plans, in each case with respect to employees, officers,
directors and consultants of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates who are not retained immediately following the Effective Time, or
who do not enter into new employment, change in control or severance
agreements with Heritage as contemplated in the preceding sentence, shall be
honored by the Surviving Company or a Heritage Subsidiary unless such Puget
Sound Benefit Plan is terminated prior to the Effective Time. Heritage
reserves the right in its sole discretion, not to offer continued employment
with any such employee that does not enter into a new agreement with Heritage
prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Heritage or Puget Sound or any of their Subsidiaries
or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Company, Puget Sound, Heritage or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Company, Puget Sound, Heritage or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of Heritage or Puget Sound or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular Puget Sound Benefit Plan, Heritage Benefit Plan, or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
_Section 9.9_, nothing in this _Section 6.5_ , express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any third party, including without limitation any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Heritage or
Puget Sound or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.5_.

  


 

  

(g) In the event that any disqualified individual of Puget Sound or its
Subsidiaries receives any payments, benefits or acceleration of vesting (the "
_Total Payments_ ") in connection with the Merger that would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that
is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then Puget Sound
will take all steps necessary to ensure that the Total Payments will be
reduced such that the value of the Total Payments that each counterparty is
entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the
counterparty may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or
resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under
Section 280G of the Code.

  


 

  

(h) Puget Sound and each of its Subsidiaries shall take all such required
corporate action during the 30 day period prior to the Effective Time to
terminate all of the Salary Continuation Agreements set forth in _Section
3.11(a)_ of the Puget Sound Disclosure Schedule, consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, with such terminations to be
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and with all such payments
thereunder being calculated pursuant to Section 2.4 of the applicable Salary
Continuation Agreements and determined as if such employees were terminated as
of the Effective Time in connection with the Merger. All such payments shall
be distributed to the applicable parties to the Salary Continuation Agreements
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be subject to all
applicable tax withholding requirements.

  


 

  

6.6 _Officers\' and Directors\' Insurance; Indemnification_.

  

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Heritage shall
maintain officers\' and directors\' liability insurance covering the persons
who are covered by Puget Sound\'s current officers\'

    

  

and directors\' liability insurance policy with respect to actions, omissions,
events, matters or circumstances occurring prior to the Effective Time, on
terms which are at least substantially equivalent to the terms of said current
policy, provided that it shall not be required to expend, on an annual basis,
during the coverage period more than an amount equal to 150% of the annual
premium most recently paid by Puget Sound (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to
maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto, and further provided
that if Heritage is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this _Section 6.6(a)_ , Heritage shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the
Insurance Amount. At Puget Sound\'s option, Puget Sound may, in lieu of the
foregoing, (or, if requested by Heritage, Puget Sound shall) purchase prior to
the Effective Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy providing single
limit equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence for a
premium cost not to exceed 250% of the current annual premium for such
insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained by Puget Sound
prior to the Effective Time, Heritage shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company and no other party shall
have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. The
officers and directors of Puget Sound or its Subsidiaries may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
Heritage\'s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

  

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Heritage shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any
time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective
Time, a director or officer of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Puget Sound Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall
require the prior written consent of Heritage, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a " _Claim_ "), in
which a Puget Sound Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party
or witness or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of Puget Sound or any of its Subsidiaries if such Claim pertains to
any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the organizational
documents of Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries and to the fullest extent
otherwise permitted by law.

  

(c) In connection with the indemnification provided pursuant to _Section
6.6(b)_ , Heritage and/or a Heritage Subsidiary (i) will advance expenses,
promptly after statements therefor are received, to each Puget Sound
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by law and Governmental
Entities (provided the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such
individual is not entitled to indemnification), including the payment of the
fees and expenses of one counsel with respect to a matter, and one local
counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, if necessary or appropriate, selected
by such Puget Sound Indemnified Person or multiple Puget Sound Indemnified
Persons, it being understood that they collectively shall only be entitled to
one counsel and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction where
necessary or appropriate (unless a conflict shall exist between them in which
case they may retain separate counsel), all such counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Heritage and (ii) will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter.

  

(d) This _Section 6.6_ shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to
benefit each Puget Sound Indemnified Person (each of whom shall be entitled to
enforce this Section against Heritage), and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Heritage.

  

    

  

 

(e) In the event Heritage or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or more
other persons or entities, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Heritage assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  

6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Each of the Board of
Directors of Heritage and Puget Sound or a committee of Non-Employee Directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the receipt by Puget Sound Insiders of Heritage Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. As used herein, the term " _Puget Sound
Insiders_ " means those officers and directors of Puget Sound who will become
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as
insiders of Heritage in conjunction with the Merger.

 

  

6.8 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) Puget Sound agrees that, except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.8(b)_
, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , it will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, and employees of
Puget Sound and its Subsidiaries (the " _Puget Sound Individuals"_ ) not to,
and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause Puget Sound\'s
and its Subsidiaries\' agents, advisors and controlled affiliates,
accountants, legal counsel, and financial advisors (the " _Puget Sound
Representatives_ ") not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data concerning its and/or its Subsidiaries business,
properties or assets (" _Puget Sound Confidential Information_ ") to, or have
any discussions with, any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal. Puget Sound will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons or entities other than Heritage with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts,
subject to applicable law, to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to such an Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.8(a)_ , at any time
from the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Puget Sound
Shareholder Approval, in the event Puget Sound receives an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Puget Sound determines in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal may constitute a Superior Proposal
(as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
Puget Sound may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and the Puget Sound
Individuals and the Puget Sound Representatives to, (i) negotiate the terms
of, and enter into, a confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions no
less favorable to Puget Sound than the Confidentiality Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), (ii) furnish or cause to be
furnished Puget Sound Confidential Information to the person or entity making
such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
and (iii) negotiate and participate in such negotiations or discussions with
the person or entity making such Acquisition Proposal concerning such
Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of Puget Sound determines in
good faith (following consultation with counsel) that failure to take such
actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

  

(c) The Board of Directors of Puget Sound shall not (nor shall any committee
thereof) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Heritage, the Puget Sound
Board Recommendation or make or cause to be made any third party or public
communication proposing or announcing an intention to withdraw or modify in
any manner adverse to Heritage the Puget Sound Board Recommendation (any

    

  

such action, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of Puget Sound (including any committee thereof) may,
at any time prior to obtaining the Puget Sound Shareholder Approval, effect a
Change in Recommendation in response to a bona fide written unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that the Board of
Directors of Puget Sound determines in good faith (after consultation with
Puget Sound\'s outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Puget Sound may not make a
Change in Recommendation, or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_ , with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until it has given Heritage
at least four (4) business days, following Heritage\'s initial receipt of
written notice that the Board of Directors of Puget Sound has determined that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and the reasons therefor, to
respond to any such Acquisition Proposal and, taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Heritage, the Board of
Directors of Puget Sound determines in good faith (after consultation with
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

  

(d) Puget Sound will promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days)
advise Heritage in writing following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and
the substance thereof (including the identity of the person or entity making
such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Heritage apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions, whether written or oral, of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current
basis.

  

(e) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set forth
below:

  

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Puget Sound or
Puget Sound Bank or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than
20% of the voting power in, or more than 20% of the fair market value of the
business, assets or deposits of, Puget Sound or Puget Sound Bank, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of Puget Sound concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger, (i) after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors (ii) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law; provided, however, that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more
than 20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority".

  

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Parties shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.
Each of Puget Sound and Heritage shall promptly inform the other in writing
upon receiving notice of any claim, demand, cause of action or investigation
by any Governmental Entity or third party against, or threatened against, it
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, properties, or
any of their respective directors, officers or employees in their individual
capacities as such.

  

6.10 _Correction of Information_. Each of Puget Sound and Heritage shall
promptly correct and supplement in writing any information furnished under
this Agreement so that such information shall be correct and complete in all
material respects at all times, without taking into account any Material
Adverse Effect qualification, and shall include all facts necessary to make
such information correct and

    

  

 

complete in all material respects at all times; provided, however, that in
each case, such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or any failure of a condition
under _Article VII_ , or to otherwise limit or affect in any way the remedies
available hereunder to any party receiving such notice.

  

6.11 _Integration_. From and after the date hereof, Puget Sound shall, and
shall cause Puget Sound Bank and its and Puget Sound Bank\'s directors,
officers and employees to, make all commercially reasonable best efforts
(without undue disruption to either business) to (i) cooperate in order to
permit Heritage Bank to train Puget Sound Bank employees who are expected to
continue employment with Heritage Bank, including excusing such employees from
their duties for the purpose of training and orientation by Heritage Bank and
(ii) cause Puget Sound Bank\'s data processing consultants and software
providers to, cooperate and assist Puget Sound Bank and Heritage Bank in
connection with the planned electronic and systematic conversion of all
applicable data of Puget Sound Bank to the Heritage Bank system to occur after
the Effective Time, in each case without undue disruption to Puget Sound
Bank\'s business, during normal business hours and at the expense of Heritage
or Heritage Bank (not to include Puget Sound Bank\'s regular employee
payroll).

 

  

6.12 _Coordination; Integration_. Subject to applicable law and regulation,
during the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time, Puget Sound
shall cause the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Puget
Sound Bank to assist and confer with the officers of Heritage Bank, on a
periodic basis, relating to the development, coordination and implementation
of the post-Merger operating and integration plans of Heritage Bank, as the
resulting bank in the Bank Merger.

  

6.13 _Delivery of Agreements._ Puget Sound shall cause the Voting Agreements
to be executed by its directors and executive officers and the Non-Compete
Agreements to be executed by its directors and delivered to Heritage prior to
or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement.

exception for, or reference to, materiality (including the terms "material,"

disregarded; and Puget Sound shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Heritage by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial
Officer of Heritage to the foregoing effect.

  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Heritage_. Heritage shall have performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Puget Sound shall have

Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Heritage to such effect.

  

(c) _Opinion of Tax Counsel_. Puget Sound shall have received an opinion from
Keller Rohrback L.L.P. special counsel to Puget Sound, dated the Closing Date,
to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

  

Rohrback L.L.P. may require and rely upon representations contained in letters
from each of Heritage and Puget Sound.

  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Puget Sound Shareholder Approval,
by action of the Board of Directors of a party, as follows:

  

(a) by the written mutual consent of Puget Sound and Heritage;

  

(b) by either Puget Sound or Heritage, if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
any covenant or agreement in this Agreement required to be performed prior to
the Effective Time;

  

(c) by either Puget Sound or Heritage, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before March 31, 2018, unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth in this Agreement;

  

(d) by either Puget Sound or Heritage (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of Puget Sound, in the case of a termination by
Heritage, or Heritage, in the case of a termination by Puget Sound, which
breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2 or 7.3_ , as the case may be, and which is not cured within
twenty (20) days following written notice to the party committing such breach
or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

  

(e) by Heritage if (i) the Board of Directors of Puget Sound (or any committee
thereof) shall have failed to make the Puget Sound Board Recommendation or
made a Change in Recommendation or (ii) Puget Sound shall have materially
breached any of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.8_ or (iii) Puget Sound
shall have refused to call or hold the Puget Sound Shareholder Meeting (except
as provided in the last sentence of _Section 6.3_ );

  

(f) by Puget Sound prior to obtaining the Puget Sound Shareholder Approval in
order to enter into an agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance
with _Section 6.8_ ; provided, however, that Puget Sound has (i) not
materially breached the provisions of _Section 6.8_ , and (ii) complied with
its payment obligation under _Section 8.4(a)_ ;

  

(g) by either Puget Sound or Heritage, if the provisions of _Section 8.1(e)_
are not applicable and the shareholders of Puget Sound fail to provide the
Puget Sound Shareholder Approval at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at
an adjournment or postponement thereof; or

  

    

  

(h) by either Heritage or Puget Sound immediately following the Determination
Date, in the event the Heritage Average Closing Price for the Determination
Period is less than $20.44 (with a proportionate adjustment in the event that
outstanding shares of Heritage Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number of shares by reason of any stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date);
provided, however, if Heritage elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ , it shall give prompt written notice
thereof to Puget Sound, and Puget Sound shall, for a period of two (2)
business days after its receipt of such notice, have the option of reinstating
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by adjusting the Merger
Consideration to a fixed Exchange Ratio of 1.3200. If within such two (2)
business day period, Puget Sound delivers written notice to Heritage that it
intends to reinstate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no termination shall occur
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ and this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms (except for the modification to
the Exchange Ratio set forth in the preceding sentence).

  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Puget Sound or Heritage as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Puget Sound,
Heritage, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that (i) _Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6,
9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10 and 9.11_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated under _Section 8.1(d)_ , the non-
terminating party shall not, except as provided in _Section 8.4(c)_ , be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except with respect to costs and expenses of printing
and mailing the Proxy Statement, which shall be borne by Puget Sound, and all
filing and other fees in connection with any filing with the SEC and
Regulatory Agencies, which shall be borne by Heritage, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, this Agreement, and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

  

8.4 _Termination Fee_.

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(e) or (f)_ , then
(i) in the case of termination under _Section 8.1(e)_ , Puget Sound shall
immediately following such termination pay Heritage an amount equal to
$4,250,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), and (ii) in the case of termination
under _Section 8.1(f)_ , Puget Sound shall, simultaneously with such
termination and as a condition thereof, pay Heritage the Termination Fee, in
each case in same-day funds.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either party under _Section 8.1(g)_ ,
and prior thereto there has been publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal,
then if within one year of such termination Puget Sound or Puget Sound Bank
either (A) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or (B) consummates an Acquisition Proposal, Puget Sound shall
immediately pay Heritage the Termination Fee set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ in
same-day funds. For purposes of clauses (A) and (B) above, the reference to
20% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be 50%.

  

(c) The payment of the Termination Fee shall fully discharge Puget Sound from
any and all liability under this Agreement and related to the transactions
contemplated herein, and Heritage shall not be entitled to any other relief or
remedy against Puget Sound. If the Termination Fee is not payable, Heritage
may pursue any and all remedies available to it against Puget Sound on account
of a willful and material breach by Puget Sound of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Moreover, if the Termination

    

  

Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii) or (iii)_ , Heritage shall have
the right to pursue any and all remedies available to it against Puget Sound
on account of the willful and material breach by Puget Sound of _Section 6.8_
in lieu of accepting the Termination Fee under _Section 8.4(a)._ Puget Sound
may pursue any and all remedies available to it against Heritage on account of
a willful and material breach by Heritage of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the
shareholders of Puget Sound; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Puget
Sound, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable
law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." All schedules and exhibits hereto shall be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is
held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that
any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it
is the express intention of the Parties that such provision, covenant or
restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

  

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and

  

    

  

 

shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party
need not sign the same counterpart.

  

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior written,
and prior or contemporaneous oral, agreements and understandings, between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

9.7 _Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Venue and Construction_. This Agreement
shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Washington and applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such
state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles or any
other principle that could require the application of the application of the
law of any other jurisdiction. The Parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state
court located in the State of Washington. Each of the Parties hereto submits
to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or
future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party hereto
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. This Agreement has been negotiated and prepared by the Parties and
their respective counsel. This Agreement shall be fairly interpreted in
accordance with its terms and without any strict construction in favor or
against either party.

 

  

9.8 _Publicity_. Neither Puget Sound nor Heritage shall, and neither Puget
Sound nor Heritage shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Heritage, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Puget Sound, or Puget Sound, in the case of a
proposed announcement or statement by Heritage; provided, however, that either
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior
consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq.

  

9.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by
either of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall
be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except for _Section 6.6_
, which is intended to benefit each indemnified person referenced therein, or
as otherwise specifically provided herein, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to
and does not confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto any rights
or remedies under this Agreement.

  

9.10 _Specific Performance; Time of the Essence_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled specific performance of
the terms hereof, without the necessity of demonstrating irreparable harm or
posting of any bond or

  

    

  

 

security, in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law
or equity. Time is of the essence for performance of the agreements, covenants
and obligations of the Parties herein.

  

9.11 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, each party
delivered to the other a schedule (each a "Disclosure Schedule") that sets
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties of the disclosing party contained in Article III or Article IV, as
applicable, and, in the case of Puget Sound, to one or more of its covenants
contained herein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and
(b) the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Previously Disclosed" means information set forth by a party in
the applicable paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule, or any other paragraph of
its Disclosure Schedule (so long as it is reasonably clear from the context
that the disclosure in such other paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).

 

  

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.11.

  

  

  

    

  

Heritage and Puget Sound have caused this Agreement to be executed by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above
written.
