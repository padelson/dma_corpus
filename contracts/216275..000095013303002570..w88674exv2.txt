financing or leasing transactions involving Products that are funded on or
prior to the Closing Date.   ARTICLE III  PURCHASE PRICE   3.1. Purchase
Price: The purchase price payable by Purchaser to Seller for the Purchased
Assets and Seller\'s non-competition covenants in Section 13.1 (the "Purchase
Price") shall be One Hundred Million United States Dollars
(U.S. $100,000,000.00), subject to     -7-   adjustment as provided in
Article IV of this Agreement, plus the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities.   3.2. Payment of Purchase Price: At the Closing, Purchaser
shall (a) transfer to a bank account designated by Seller an amount equal to
Ninety Million United States Dollars (U.S. $90,000,000.00) (the "Closing
Payment") by a wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. currency,
and (b) deliver to Seller the Promissory Note, which Promissory Note shall
evidence Purchaser\'s obligation to pay to Seller, on the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, an amount equal to Ten Million United States Dollars
(U.S. $10,000,000.00), together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate
(the "Note Payment").   ARTICLE IV  DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF
ADJUSTED  PURCHASE PRICE   4.1. Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired:
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide or cause to be provided to Seller a draft of the Closing Statement of
Net Assets Acquired, as hereinafter defined, along with all data and
supporting documentation necessary for purposes of Seller\'s preparation of
the final Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired. Within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, and shall deliver
to Purchaser, an audited statement of Net Assets Acquired (the "Closing
Statement of Net Assets Acquired") of the Business as at the Closing Date,
which Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired shall be accompanied by a
report of Ernst and Young LLP to the effect that, except as otherwise specified
in such report, the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Accounting Policies applied on a
basis consistent with that used in preparing the Reference Statement of
Net Assets Acquired. Provided, however, that (i) the following liabilities
will not be included on the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired: (a)
product liability in accordance with Section 2.2(e) above; (b) liability for
litigation in accordance with Section 2.2(h) above; and (c) liability for
Taxes in accordance with Section 2.2(b) above; and (ii) any goodwill or other
intangible impairment charges recorded subsequent to the Reference Statement
of Net Assets Acquired will not be included on the Closing Statement of Net
Assets Acquired.   4.2. Review of Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired:
Purchaser shall have the right to review the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired and Seller shall provide Purchaser with access to the work papers
used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement of Net
Assets Acquired. If Purchaser does not notify Seller to the contrary within
thirty (30) calendar days after the date the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired is delivered to Purchaser, then the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired delivered by Seller shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. If, however, Purchaser notifies Seller in writing
within such period that it believes the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Accounting Policies
on a basis consistent with that used in preparing the Reference Statement of
Net Assets Acquired and specifies (a) the items as to which it believes the
accounting policies used in preparing the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Accounting
Policies on a basis consistent with that used in preparing the Reference
Statement of Net Assets Acquired (b) the amount of the adjustment it proposes
with respect to each item, and (c) a brief statement     -8-   of the
basis for such belief, the parties will then attempt to resolve
their differences with respect thereto. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that disputes pursuant to this Article IV ("Closing Statement Claims")
are limited to the types of disputes described in the immediately
preceding sentence. Purchaser shall not be entitled to dispute any individual
item which involves a proposed adjustment to the Closing Statement of Net
Assets Acquired of less than One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (U.S.
$100,000.00) and the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired shall not be
subject to any adjustment unless and to the extent the aggregate of all
adjustments (each of which exceeds the One Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars (U.S. $100,000.00) threshold) exceeds Two Million United States
Dollars (U.S. $2,000,000.00). At any time by mutual consent of the parties
(or, if the parties are not able to resolve their disputes within sixty (60)
days after the date the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired is delivered
to Purchaser, at any time thereafter by either party with or without the
consent of the other party), disputes pursuant to this Article IV may be
referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP, certified public accountants (or if such
firm is unable or unwilling to serve, to another "Big Four" accounting firm
selected by mutual agreement of Seller and Purchaser) (the "Firm"), which
Firm shall be asked to determine whether there was an inconsistency in the
application of the accounting policies between those used in preparing the
Reference Statement of Net Assets Acquired and those used in preparing the
Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired and report to Seller and Purchaser
upon such remaining disputed items within sixty (60) calendar days after such
referral. Such referral shall be made in writing to the Firm, with a copy of
such referral sent to the other party hereto. The decision of the Firm shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, provided,
however, that the Firm may only resolve Closing Statement Claims pursuant to
the provisions of Article IV, and provided further that the only remedy the
Firm shall be permitted to impose are the determinations called for pursuant
to Article IV. The fees and expenses of the Firm shall be allocated between
Seller and Purchaser as follows: (i) Seller shall pay all or a portion of the
Firm\'s fees and expenses, as determined in accordance with the following
formula:   AE x AA = SE  --  PA  where: "AE" means the Firm\'s total
fees and expenses; "AA" means the aggregate adjustment, if any, to the
Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired made in Purchaser\'s favor by the
Firm (if such adjustment is in Seller\'s favor, "AA" shall be zero); "PA"
means the aggregate adjustment to the Closing Statement of Net Assets
Acquired that would have resulted from resolution in Purchaser\'s favor of
all points of disagreement raised by Purchaser to the Firm and "SE" means
Seller\'s share of the Firm\'s fees and expenses; and (ii) Purchaser
shall pay the balance of the Firm\'s fees and expenses, if any.   4.3.
Cooperation: Representatives of Seller shall be given access to all pertinent
books, records and other data of the Business for the purpose of preparing
the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired. Personnel of Purchaser and
Purchaser\'s Affiliates may be consulted by such representatives.
Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Affiliates shall provide preferential cooperation
and support to Seller and Seller\'s representatives in order to accommodate
the deadlines set forth in this Article IV.     -9-    4.4. Settlement
of Adjusted Purchase Price: Within ten (10) calendar days after the final
determination of the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired, (a) in the
event that the Net Assets Acquired of the Business as set forth on the
Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired exceeds the Net Assets Acquired of
One Hundred Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (US $105,200,000) as
set forth on the Reference Statement of Net Assets Acquired, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller the amount of such excess, and (b) in the event that the Net
Assets Acquired of the Business as set forth on the Closing Statement of Net
Assets Acquired are less than the Net Assets Acquired of One Hundred Five
Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (US $105,200,000) as set forth on the
Reference Statement of Net Assets Acquired, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the
amount of such shortfall by reducing the principal of the Promissory Note
as of the date that is ten (10) calendar days after the final determination
of the Closing Statement of Net Assets Acquired by the amount of such
shortfall. The amount of the cash payments described in this Section 4.4
shall be paid with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of such
payment, calculated at a rate equal to JLG\'s (in the case of payments by
Purchaser) or the Guarantor\'s (in the case of payments by Seller) blended
borrowing rate on interest-bearing debt for JLG\'s or the Guarantor\'s most
recently completed fiscal quarter, as applicable, in immediately available
funds remitted by wire transfer to a bank designated by payee.   4.5.
Allocation of Purchase Price: Seller and Purchaser shall allocate the
Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to this Article IV, among the
Purchased Assets and the non-competition covenants contained in Section 13.1
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.   ARTICLE V  CLOSING MATTERS   5.1. The
Closing:   (a) The closing of the purchase and sale (the
"Closing") contemplated under this Agreement shall take place at the offices
of Seller, located at 40 Westminster Street, Providence, Rhode Island, or at
such other place as the parties shall mutually agree upon, at 10:00 A.M.
local time on a date which is not later than two (2) business days after each
of the conditions set forth in Article X and Article XI hereof have been
satisfied or waived, or such other date as Purchaser and Seller may mutually
agree. The date the Closing takes place is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date." The Closing shall be effective as of midnight on the Closing Date.  
(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall transfer to a bank account designated by
Seller the Closing Payment in accordance with Section 3.2 above and the
Estimated Payment in accordance with Section 13.8 below.   (c) At the
Closing and effective on the Closing Date, Seller shall execute and deliver
(or cause to be executed and delivered) the following documents to Purchaser
(collectively, the "Conveyance Instruments"):   (i) INTENTIONALLY LEFT
BLANK     -10-    (ii) certificates of title or origin (or like 
documents) with respect to all vehicles included in the  Purchased Assets and
other equipment for which a certificate  of title or origin is required in
order for title thereto to  be transferred to Purchaser, each of which are
listed on  Schedule 5.1(c)(ii); and   (iii) bills of sale, endorsements,
assignments and  other good and sufficient instruments of sale, transfer, 
conveyance and assignment, in form reasonably satisfactory to  Purchaser, as
shall be effective to vest in Purchaser good and  marketable title, free and
clear of all Encumbrances, to the  Purchased Assets.   (d) Subject to
Section 6.2, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, and
the Purchased Assets shall not include, any contract, license, lease,
commitment, sales order or purchase order or other agreement if and to the
extent that an assignment or attempted assignment of the same without the
consent of the other party thereto would constitute a breach thereof or in
any way impair the rights of Seller thereunder.   (e) Without limiting any
provisions hereof, Seller agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, it
will by appropriate instrument (the "Power of Attorney") constitute and
appoint Purchaser, its successors and assigns, the true and lawful attorney
of Seller with full power of substitution in the name of Purchaser or in the
name of Seller but for the benefit and at the expense of Purchaser (i) to
collect for the account of Purchaser all Purchased Receivables and any other
items to be sold and transferred or intended to be sold and transferred to
Purchaser as provided in this Agreement, (ii) to institute and prosecute all
proceedings which Purchaser may deem proper in order to collect, assert or
enforce any right or title of any kind in or to the Purchased Assets, to
defend or compromise any and all actions, suits or proceedings in respect of
any of the Purchased Assets and to do all such acts and things in relation
thereto as Purchaser shall deem advisable, and (iii) to take all reasonable
actions which Purchaser may deem proper in order to provide for Purchaser the
benefits under any contracts, licenses, leases, sales orders or purchase
orders where any required consent of another party to the assignment thereof
to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall not have been obtained. Seller
acknowledges that the foregoing powers are coupled with an interest and shall
be irrevocable by Seller or by its subsequent dissolution or in any manner or
for any reason. Purchaser shall be entitled to retain for its own account
any amounts collected pursuant to the foregoing powers including any amounts
payable as interest in respect thereof.   (f) At the Closing, and effective
on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall execute and deliver (or cause to be
executed and delivered) to Seller an assignment and assumption agreement in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Seller evidencing the assumption by Purchaser
of the Assumed Liabilities (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement").  
ARTICLE VI  TRANSFER AFTER THE CLOSING   6.1. Further Instruments and
Actions:     -11-    (a) From time to time after the Closing Date, upon
request of Purchaser, Seller, without further consideration, shall cooperate
with Purchaser and shall duly execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and powers of attorney and
take such other actions and give such assurances as may be reasonably
required to convey to and vest in Purchaser and to protect its right, title
and interest in and enjoyment of all the Purchased Assets, all as may be
appropriate otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, upon request of Seller, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller
and duly execute, acknowledge, and deliver all such further assumptions,
assignments, transfers, conveyances and powers of attorney and take such
other actions and give such assurances as may be reasonably required to
evidence Purchaser\'s assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, all as may be
appropriate otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) After the Closing, if Seller or its Affiliates receive
any payment, refund or other amount which is attributable to, results from or
is related to a Purchased Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall
promptly remit or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to Purchaser.
Seller shall promptly endorse and deliver to Purchaser any notes, checks,
negotiable instruments, letters of credit or other documents received on
account of, attributable to or otherwise relating to the Purchased Assets,
and Purchaser shall have the right and authority to endorse, without
recourse, the name of Seller or any of its Affiliates on any such instrument
or document. After the Closing, if Purchaser or its Affiliates receive any
refund or other amount which is related to Claims or other matters for which
Seller is responsible hereunder, and which amount is not attributable to,
does not result from and is not otherwise related to a Purchased Asset, or is
otherwise properly due and owing to Seller in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly remit, or cause to be remitted, such
amount to Seller. Purchaser shall promptly endorse and deliver to Seller any
notes, checks, negotiable instruments, letters of credit or other documents
received on account of, attributable to or otherwise relating to the Excluded
Assets, and Seller shall have the right and authority to endorse, without
recourse, the name of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on any
such instrument or document.   6.2. Purchased Assets Requiring Consents: In
the event any consent of a third party is legally required for the sale,
assignment or transfer to Purchaser of any Purchased Asset (other than
Government Contracts, which are addressed in Section 6.3):   (a) Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts, at Seller\'s sole cost and expense, to
obtain such consent prior to the Closing Date but in any event until such
consent is obtained.   (b) If any such consent cannot be obtained prior to
the Closing Date and the Closing occurs, this Agreement and the related
instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer of the
applicable Purchased Asset, but Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain such consent as soon as possible after the Closing Date. Purchaser
will cooperate, using its reasonable best efforts, with Seller in Seller\'s
efforts to obtain such consents. If any such consent shall not be obtained
prior to Closing or within ninety (90) days after Closing as provided below,
then, at Purchaser\'s option, (i) the applicable Purchased Asset shall be an
Excluded Asset and Purchaser shall not assume any liability relating thereto
or arising thereunder    -12-   or (ii) Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain for Purchaser substantially all of the practical
benefits and burdens of such property or rights, including by (y) entering
into appropriate and reasonable alternative arrangements on terms mutually
agreeable to Purchaser and Seller and (z) subject to the consent and control
of Purchaser, enforcement, at the cost and for the account of Purchaser, of
any and all rights of Seller against the other party thereto arising out of
the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise. If and
to the extent that such arrangement cannot be made on terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall have no obligation or liability with respect to
any such asset, and Seller shall provide Purchaser with an equitable rebate
(subject to Purchaser\'s obligation to mitigate its damages) reflecting the
diminution in value of the Purchased Assets, which rebate shall be determined
by the parties. If Purchaser receives an equitable rebate pursuant to this
paragraph, Purchaser shall not seek recovery relating to such asset under any
other provision of this Agreement.   (c) If any of the Permits included in
the Purchased Assets are not so assignable or transferable without obtaining
a replacement Permit prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement and the
related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer thereof, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in its efforts to
obtain replacement Permits issued in Purchaser\'s name. If any replacement
Permit cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, Seller agrees to allow
Purchaser to operate under its Permits if permitted by applicable Laws or
applicable Governmental Entities for a period of up to three (3) months after
the Closing (or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary for
Purchaser, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the replacement
Permits) provided that Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller
harmless in connection with any liability arising as a result of Purchaser\'s
operation of the Business under such Permits after the Closing.   6.3.
Novation of U.S. Government Contracts:   (a) Seller and Purchaser recognize
that, pursuant to FAR, the U.S. Government will require the novation of the
contracts between Seller (by and through the Business) and the U.S.
Government (including any agency, authority or department thereof) set forth
on Schedule 6.3(a) ("Government Contracts"). Seller and Purchaser further
recognize that, under FAR, such novation will take place after the Closing
Date. The parties hereto agree that they will use their reasonable best
efforts to cause any such required novations to be approved, and will provide
required releases, guarantees, bonds, and other assurances that may be
required by the U.S. Government in connection with any such novations, as
soon after the Closing as possible and will cooperate fully with one another
in such process. Pending the effectiveness of such novations, Purchaser and
Seller shall execute subcontracts or other agreements that shall, to the
extent legally permissible, require Purchaser to perform the obligations of
Seller under such Government Contracts and enable Purchaser to receive
all economic and other benefits and assume all required post-closing
performance risks under such Government Contracts.   (b) The parties
further recognize that, pursuant to FAR or the terms of any novation
agreements with the U.S. Government, Seller may remain liable to the U.S.
Government for compliance by Purchaser with the terms and conditions of one
or more of the Government Contracts. Therefore, whether or not novation of
Government Contracts has been effected, in the event that Seller, by Law or
contract, shall retain any residual liability to the U.S.    
-13-   Government with respect to any Government Contracts, Purchaser
agrees that after the Closing Date:   (i) Purchaser shall faithfully
perform all of the  obligations of Seller under the Government Contracts;  
(ii) In the event that Seller receives notice from  the U.S. Government that
Purchaser has not performed its  obligations under a Government Contract, and
if, after notice  by Seller to Purchaser of such notice from the U.S. 
Government, Purchaser has not remedied such nonperformance  within a
reasonable period of time, then Seller shall have the  right to (A) perform
such obligations itself or by an  Affiliate or to cause such obligations to
be performed by a  third party, or (B) seek specific performance by Purchaser
of  its obligations under such Government Contract; and   (iii) Purchaser
shall indemnify Seller against, and  hold it harmless from, any and all
damages, costs and expenses  (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) arising  out of, or based upon, or in any way connected with
(whether  such connection be proximate or remote, foreseeable or 
unforeseeable as of the Closing Date), in whole or in part,  the failure of
Purchaser to so perform its obligations under  the Government Contracts.  
(c) Purchaser agrees that in the event that any Government Contract, with
respect to which Seller retains residual liability as set forth in this
Section 6.3, is sold, assigned or otherwise transferred by Purchaser
to another entity (hereinafter, the "Transferee Entity") without effecting
a release of any obligations of Seller to the U.S. Government under
such Government Contract, Purchaser shall (i) give Seller prior written
notice of such sale, assignment or transfer, and (ii) as a condition to such
sale, assignment or transfer, shall require such Transferee Entity to agree,
in writing, to be bound by the provisions of this Section 6.3, insofar as
they relate to the performance of continuing obligations under such
Government Contract after the date of such sale, assignment or transfer (the
"Post Transfer Obligations"), and to further agree that Seller shall be
entitled to exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 6.3 directly against
such Transferee Entity insofar as such rights relate to the Post Transfer
Obligations. Except as Purchaser and Seller may otherwise agree, neither such
sale, assignment nor transfer, nor such agreement of the Transferee Entity,
shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations to Seller pursuant to this Section
6.3.   ARTICLE VII  ACTIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING   7.1. Obtaining of
Consents:   (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate
in the filing required by the HSR Act. The parties agree that the HSR Act
filing will be made not later than the first business day following the
execution of this Agreement. The HSR Act filing fee(s) shall be paid by
Purchaser.     -14-    (b) As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, Seller shall make all other necessary filings with all Governmental
Entities and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits and
consents of all third parties required for the sale, assignment or transfer
to Purchaser of any of the Purchased Assets and the Business and the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Except as set forth in Section 7.1(a), Seller shall be responsible for the
cost of complying with or obtaining the consent to or approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby of any Governmental Entity or other third
party, including without limitation, any such approval or consent required by
any safety, health, Environmental Law or other applicable Law or regulation.
Each party hereto shall provide to the other party such information as the
other party may reasonably request in order to enable it to prepare such
filings. Each party hereto shall also use its respective best efforts to
expedite any governmental or other third party review and to obtain all
necessary consents, approvals, licenses and Permits as promptly
as practicable.   (c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining ATandT;
Solutions Inc.\'s ("ATandT;\'s") consent to the continuation of the lease of
the equipment described on Schedule 7.1(c) for six (6) months after the
Closing Date on substantially the same terms as are available to Seller on
the Closing Date and with direct billing to Purchaser. After such time,
should Purchaser elect not to obtain technology services and management from
ATandT; similar to those in the Technology Services and Management Agreement
dated August 27, 1996 between Textron Inc. and ATandT; (the "TSMA"), Purchaser
shall purchase the assets described in Schedule 7.1(c) at a price to be
negotiated between ATandT; and Purchaser, not to exceed One Hundred Sixty Eight
Thousand United States Dollars (U.S. $168,000.00). Promptly after the
Closing, Seller shall cause all invoices with respect to all third party
contracts and equipment to the extent related to the Business for which ATandT;
acts as agent for Seller to be rendered directly to Purchaser.   7.2.
Actions of Seller and Conduct of Business:   (a) Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to perform and satisfy all conditions to Closing to be performed
or satisfied by Seller under this Agreement by the Closing Date or such other
date by which performance is required hereunder.   (b) From the date hereof
through the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Purchaser,
Seller shall not, except as required or expressly permitted pursuant to the
terms hereof, make any material change in the conduct of the Business or the
Purchased Assets or enter into any material transaction other than in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice and shall
continue to conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice.   (c) Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, unless otherwise
agreed orally or in writing by Purchaser, Seller shall, with respect to the
Business:   (i) carry on its activities in the ordinary course of  business
in substantially the same manner as heretofore  conducted;     -15-   
(ii) maintain and keep its plants and equipment in as  good repair, working
order and condition as at present, except  for depreciation due to ordinary
wear and tear and except for  planned plant closures, reconfigurations or
restructurings  described on Schedule 7.2(c)(ii) (provided, however, that 
Seller shall not be obligated to proceed with any such planned  plant
closures, reconfigurations or restructurings);   (iii) keep in full force
and effect insurance  comparable in amount and scope of coverage to that
now  maintained;   (iv) perform all obligations under the Assigned 
Contracts and any other documents relating to or materially  affecting the
Purchased Assets or the Business;   (v) comply with all applicable Laws;  
(vi) not enter into any contracts, agreements or  commitments other than (a)

of business and  consistent with past practice, (b) orders for the sale of 
finished goods or services to customers in the ordinary course  of business
and consistent with past practice, (c) routine  maintenance contracts in the
ordinary course of business and  consistent with past practice, or (d) any
other agreement  entered into in the ordinary course of business and
consistent  with past practice, having an unexpired term of twelve (12) 
months or fewer and involving aggregate payments of less than  $100,000, and
not amend, modify or terminate any of the  Assigned Contracts or waive
compliance with any provision  thereof;   (vii) not enter into any new
employee benefit plan,  program or arrangement or amend any existing employee
benefit  plan, program or arrangement or grant any increases in any 
employee\'s compensation or severance arrangement, except for  increases in
compensation in the ordinary course of business  and consistent with past
practice or as required by applicable  Law;   (viii) not enter into any
third party financing or  leasing transactions involving Products of the
Business other  than such transactions that as of the Closing Date would be 
included in the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.1(o)  (provided,
that for the avoidance of doubt this clause (viii)  shall not prohibit
financing or leasing transactions with TFC  involving Products of the
Business);   (ix) not take, or fail to take, any other action  which could
reasonably be expected to result in a breach or  inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of  Seller contained in this Agreement;  
(x) not, except for the Owned Real Property,  mortgage, pledge or subject to
any Encumbrance, any of its  assets, tangible or intangible, except in the
ordinary course  of business and consistent with past practice or for
possible  liens for current state and local property Taxes not in 
default;     -16-     (xi) not, except for the Owned Real Property
but  subject to the applicable Port Washington Lease, except in the 
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice,  either sell

any license with respect to any  Intellectual Property rights;   (xii) not
make capital expenditures exceeding Fifty  Thousand United States Dollars
(U.S. $50,000.00) in the  aggregate, except as described on Schedule
7.2(c)(xii);   (xiii) not, except for the divestiture of Seller\'s  mini-
excavator parts business (which, for purposes of clarity,  shall not
constitute part of the "Business" hereunder), enter  into any other
transactions relating to the Business, other  than in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with  past practice; and   (xiv) not authorize or
agree or otherwise become  committed to do any of the foregoing.   7.3.
Actions of Purchaser: Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to perform
and satisfy all conditions to Closing to be performed or satisfied
by Purchaser under this Agreement by the Closing Date or such other date by
which performance is required hereunder.   7.4. Public Announcements:
Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any press
releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Seller nor
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue any press
release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other party\'s
approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, except that no
such approval shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by
Law.   7.5. Remarketing Agreement: Purchaser shall, and Seller shall cause
TFC to, use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute a
mutually acceptable remarketing agreement by which Purchaser would remarket
on behalf of TFC equipment obtained in connection with leasing and financing
transactions entered into by TFC prior to the Closing Date involving
Products. Such remarketing agreement shall provide that Purchaser, at TFC\'s
election, shall return to TFC or a third party designated by TFC any
equipment that Purchaser has not disposed of within sixty (60) days.
Execution of such remarketing agreement shall not be a condition to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   7.6. Access
and Information; Additional Disclosure.   (a) From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller
shall permit Purchaser and its representatives, subject to the terms of this
Section 7.6(a), to make such investigation of the Business and the Purchased
Assets as Purchaser reasonably deems necessary or desirable for purposes
exclusively related to Purchaser\'s integration planning in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Such investigation shall include access
to the directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including
legal counsel (subject to preservation of applicable privileges) and
independent accountants) of Seller and the operations, properties, books and
records of the Business. Except    -17-   as may be limited by
applicable Law, Seller shall furnish Purchaser and its representatives with
such financial, operating and other data and information, and copies of
documents with respect to the Business or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, as Purchaser shall from time to time
reasonably request for purposes exclusively related to Purchaser\'s
integration planning in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Such access and investigation (i) shall be made upon reasonable notice and at
reasonable places and times, during normal business hours and upon the prior
approval of Randy Beaty, Jack Curran, or Larry O\'Connell, whose approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) shall be limited to the
personnel and third party representatives of Purchaser and JLG set forth on
Schedule 7.6(a) and to such other Persons, if any, as the parties may agree,
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall exercise its

efforts to organize its requests for additional information so as to minimize
the impact on Seller\'s operations.   (b) From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other of (i) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event which could reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule hereto to be untrue or inaccurate as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) any failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto; provided, however, that
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
or to satisfy any condition for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article X have been satisfied.   ARTICLE VIII

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors\'
rights generally. Except as set forth in Schedule 8.2(a), neither the
execution, delivery or performance by Seller of this Agreement or any of the

hereof or thereof will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provision of the charter or by-Laws of Seller, (ii) violate any provision of
Law, statute, rule or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction, permit,

result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the
Purchased Assets.   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.2(b), no filing
with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
court or tribunal, or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency

this Agreement or any Related Documents or the consummation by Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Except as set forth in
Schedule 8.2(b), no consent or approval by, or any notification of or filing

Real Property listed on said Schedule 8.4(a)(i), Seller does not own any real
property or interest therein that is used in, held for use in or otherwise
pertains to the Business.   (b) The Leases provide rights to use the only
leased real property that is used in, held for use in or otherwise pertains

could reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely Purchaser\'s
use or enjoyment of the Leased Real Property.   (c) Except as set forth on

and clear of all Encumbrances. All tangible personal property included in the
Purchased Assets has been maintained in good operating condition and repair,
subject to ordinary wear and tear. Except for the Excluded Assets and the
assets that are set forth on Schedule 1.2(l), the Purchased Assets constitute
all of the properties, interests, assets and rights of Seller and constitute
all those necessary or useful to continue to operate the Business consistent
with past practice immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and
all such Purchased Assets are located at one of the locations set forth on
Schedule 8.5.   8.6. Contracts:   (a) Except as listed on Schedule 8.6
there are no contracts, agreements, guarantees of payment or performance,

business, (ii) contracts which by their terms terminate or are
unconditionally terminable by Seller without penalty within one year after

Purchaser true and complete copies of all of the material Assigned Contracts
and any other Assigned Contracts requested in writing by Purchaser or
Purchaser\'s representatives. All the Assigned Contracts are in full force
and effect, constituting valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto
and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as set
forth on Schedule 8.6, Seller has in all material respects performed all the
obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and there exists no
default, or any event which upon notice or the passage of time, or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any default in the performance
by Seller or by any other party under, any Assigned Contract, except for
possible defaults which do not in any material respect impair the ability of
the Business to conduct its operations as heretofore conducted or do not give
rise to any financial liability exceeding $50,000 in the aggregate. Seller
has not received any written or, to the Knowledge of Seller, oral notice that
any party to any of the Assigned Contracts intends to cancel or terminate
such contract. None of the rights of Seller under any Assigned Contracts will
be subject to termination or modification as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.     -21-    (c) Except as set forth on Schedule
8.6, no consent by any third party is required under any of the material

pending against Seller or any Affiliate of Seller affecting the Business,
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, at Law or in equity or before or by
any court or other governmental agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, or any arbitral body. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.7, there are
no Claims, actions, investigations, proceedings or suits pending, or to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
affecting the Business, Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, or as to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at Law or in equity or before or
by any court or other governmental agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, or any arbitral body an adverse outcome of which would have a
material adverse effect on the Purchased Assets or the Business, taken as a
whole.   8.8. Compliance with Law: Except as listed on Schedule 8.8 or
Schedule 8.11, Seller has not received notice that it is in violation of any
Law applicable to the operation of the Business or the Purchased Assets where
the consequences of such violation would have a material adverse effect on
the Purchased Assets or the Business, taken as a whole.   8.9. Employees
and Employee Benefit Plans:   (a) Schedule 8.9(a) contains a list of (i)
each employee of Seller with an annual base salary greater than $90,000,
including the employee\'s title, salary or wage rate, commissions for past

(ii) all written contracts, agreements or other instruments (including
employment and consulting agreements) between Seller on one hand, and any
current or former employee, independent contractor, or consultant of Seller
on the other. To the Knowledge of Seller, no employee, independent contractor
or consultant is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or
arrangement, including any confidentiality, noncompetition, or proprietary
rights agreement that would forbid the performance of his duties in a similar
capacity with Purchaser.   (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.9(b),
Seller does not sponsor, maintain, or otherwise have any obligation to
contribute to any Plans. Each plan, program, agreement or policy listed on
Schedule 8.9(b) that constitutes an "employee pension benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA is identified as such and further indicates
whether such plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA. Seller does not sponsor, maintain, or otherwise have any obligation to
contribute to any Plan subject to the requirements of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA. Seller does not sponsor, maintain, or otherwise have
an obligation to contribute to any Plan providing retiree health, medical,
life insurance, or other welfare benefits to any current employees of
Seller.   (c) For each Plan, Seller has heretofore made available
to Purchaser or Purchaser\'s counsel (i) a true, complete and correct copy of
the Plan (and, if applicable, related trust agreements, annuity contracts,
insurance contracts, and summary plan descriptions) with all amendments
thereto, (ii) the most recent IRS determination letter (if any), (iii) the
most recently     -22-   available actuarial valuation and statement of
assets (if any); and (iv) the most recent annual report (including Form 5500
and any applicable schedules thereto) required to be prepared in connection
with such Plan. Seller has heretofore made available to Purchaser or
Purchaser\'s counsel a true, complete and correct copy of each agreement
listed on Schedule 12.12.   (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.9(d), each
Plan has been established, maintained and administered in compliance with its
terms and all applicable Laws or regulations. There are no Claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, with respect to any Plan or the assets of any Plan, and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no facts exist which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such Claims (other than routine claims for benefits). All
contributions due with respect to any of the ERISA Plans including, without
limitation, the Union Savings Plan and the OmniQuip Savings Plan, have been
made as required under ERISA and have been accrued on Seller\'s financial
statements, as of the end of Seller\'s most recent fiscal year preceding the
date of this Agreement, in accordance with GAAP.   (e) Seller has provided,
or will have provided, to individuals entitled thereto all required notices
within the applicable time period and all required coverage pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to any "qualifying event" (as defined
in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) occurring prior to and including the
Closing Date, and no Tax payable on account of Section 4980B of the Code has
been incurred with respect to any Employee or Former Employee of the
Business.   (f) With respect to each ERISA Plan that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA: (i)
neither any ERISA Plan nor any fiduciary of Seller or any ERISA Plan has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction" as defined in Section 406 of ERISA;
(ii) all filings and reports as to each ERISA Plan required to have been made
on or before the Closing Date to the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or
the United States Department of Labor (the "DOL") have been or will be made
on or before such date; (iii) except as disclosed on Schedule 8.7, there is
no litigation, audit, governmental proceeding or investigation pending or to
the Knowledge of Seller threatened with respect to any ERISA Plan, its
related trusts, or any fiduciary, administrator or sponsor of any such ERISA
Plan in said capacity; and there has not been any (iv) termination, or
determination of the Secretary of the Treasury of partial termination, of any
ERISA Plan, (v) commencement of any proceeding to terminate any ERISA Plan
pursuant to ERISA, or (vi) written notice given to Seller or to the Business
of the intention to commence or seek the commencement of any such proceeding
with respect to any ERISA Plan, which, under subparagraph (iv), resulted or,
under subparagraph (v) or (vi), would result in an insufficiency of plan
assets necessary to satisfy benefits guaranteed under section 4022 of
ERISA;   (g) With respect to an ERISA Plan maintained,
sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate that is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA: (i) there has never been a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal," as such terms are respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205
of ERISA, by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate; (ii) such ERISA Plan has never
asserted that there has been a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal," as such events are respectively determined under Sections 4203
and 4205 of ERISA, by Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates,    
-23-   (iii) no event has occurred that, alone or with the passage of time,
presents a material risk of a complete withdrawal or partial withdrawal with
respect to Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates, (iv) neither Seller nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates is delinquent in making any contribution required to
be made to each such ERISA Plan, (v) there is no pending dispute between such
ERISA Plan and Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates, and (vi) if Seller
and/or its ERISA Affiliates completely withdrew from such ERISA Plan (as
determined under Section 4203 of ERISA) on the date hereof, there would be no
basis for that ERISA Plan to assess against Purchaser any amount of
withdrawal liability under Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.   (h)
With respect to each ERISA Plan which is subject to Section 401(a) of the
Code: (i) Seller has received a favorable determination letter as to
qualification of each such ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code; (ii)
each ERISA Plan has been funded in accordance with its governing documents,
ERISA and the Code, and there has been no accumulated funding deficiency, as
defined in Section 412 of the Code whether or not waived, at any time; (iii)
there has been no "Reportable Event" within the meaning of section 4043 of
ERISA (without regard to whether the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
("PBGC") has waived the requirement to report the occurrence of such event);
and (iv) all filings, premium payments, reports and notices as to each ERISA
Plan required to have been made on or before the Closing Date to the
PBGC have been or will be duly made on or before that date.   (i) The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in Article XII of this Agreement or
any Retention Agreement listed on Schedule 12.12 and provided to Purchaser or
Purchaser\'s counsel as required by Section 8.9(c) hereto, (i) entitle any
employee of Seller to severance pay or termination benefits for which
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may become liable or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any
such employee or former employee of Seller for which Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates may become liable.   (j) Without limiting the generality of
any other representation contained herein, there exists no Encumbrance, and
to the Knowledge of Seller no facts exist which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to an Encumbrance, against any Purchased Assets arising under
Sections 302(f) or 4068(a) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code.   (k) No
"payment in the nature of compensation" (as such term is defined in Section
280G(b) of the Code), whether in cash or property or the vesting of the right
to receive cash or property, or the acceleration of the timing of the receipt
of cash or property, has been made or may be made to or for the benefit of
any director, officer, employee, shareholder, independent contractor, or
consultant of the Seller that would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no
such person is entitled to receive any additional payment from the Purchaser
or Seller in the event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the
Code is imposed on such person.   8.10. Intellectual Property Rights: Except
as set forth in Schedule 8.10:   (a) Seller owns, possesses, or has the
right to use the patents, trademarks and tradenames listed in Schedule
8.10(a). The Purchased Rights constitute all the    
-24-   Intellectual Property necessary for Purchaser to design,
manufacture, sell and service telescopic material handlers and component
parts in substantially the same manner as designed, manufactured, sold and
serviced by Seller in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with
past practice immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and
otherwise to conduct the Business as presently conducted by Seller with
customers of the Business, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not alter or impair any such rights, except to the
extent such rights are transferred to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement.   (b) The rights of Seller in and to each item of
Purchased Rights are owned outright by Seller free and clear of any
Encumbrance and all of Seller\'s rights in and to the Intellectual Property
are freely assignable in Seller\'s own name, including the right to create
derivatives, and Seller is not under any obligation to pay any royalty or
other compensation to any third party or to obtain any approval or consent
for use of any of the Purchased Rights.   (c) None of the Purchased Rights
are subject to any outstanding judgment, order, decree, stipulation,
injunction, Claim or charge. Seller has not received any written notice
regarding any, and to the Knowledge of Seller there is no threatened, charge,
complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, Claim, demand or
threat challenging the legality, validity, enforceability, use or ownership
of any of the Purchased Rights.   (d) No material breach or default (or
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would result in a breach or
default) by Seller exists under any agreement pursuant to which Seller uses
any Purchased Rights, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not violate or conflict with or constitute a breach or
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default) or result in a forfeiture under, or
constitute a basis for termination of, any such agreement.   (e) To the
Knowledge of Seller, no Purchased Right owned by Seller, and no Product
offered, licensed, sold or under development by Seller for the Business,
infringes any Intellectual Property right, right of privacy or other
proprietary right of any Person or would give rise to an obligation to render
an accounting to any Person as a result of co-authorship, co-invention or an
express or implied contract for any use or transfer. Seller has not
received any written notice of any Person alleging or threatening to assert
that Seller\'s use of the Purchased Rights as used in the conduct of the
Business infringes upon or is in conflict with the Intellectual Property or
proprietary rights of such Person.   (f) Seller has not sent or otherwise
communicated to any other Person any notice, charge, claim or assertion of,
nor to the Knowledge of Seller is there, any present, impending or threatened
infringement by any other Person of any of the Purchased Rights.   (g) To
the Knowledge of Seller, no current or former employees or independent
contractors of Seller have any lawful and valid claims or rights to any of
the Purchased Rights.   (h) Seller has not sold, licensed, leased or
otherwise transferred or granted any interest or rights to any Purchased
Right (except for licenses, leases, transfers or grants of interests or
rights to any Purchased Right which are no longer in effect).    
-25-    (i) The Purchased Assets include documentation of all
material designs, specifications, and production processes of all products
manufactured by the Business. Such documentation is in a form that is
consistent with industry standards. Seller makes no representation or
warranty regarding Purchaser\'s ability after the Closing to produce products
manufactured by the Business of the same quality or for the same cost as
produced by the Business prior to the Closing.   8.11. Environmental

PURCHASER   Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as of the date
hereof and again as of the Closing Date as follows:   9.1. Organization and
Authority: Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its State of formation, and Purchaser has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Related Documents and to perform the
obligations to be performed by it hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Purchaser is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing, in all
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for any non-qualification which does not have
a material adverse effect on the business or operations of Purchaser.  
9.2. Corporate Action; No Conflict; Consent and Approval:   (a) The
execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the Related
Documents to be delivered by Purchaser and Purchaser\'s performance of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Purchaser and is, and each of the Related
Documents when executed and delivered by Purchaser in accordance with its
terms will be, the valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, except as
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting creditors\' rights generally. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by Purchaser of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents,
nor the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, nor compliance by Purchaser with any provision hereof or thereof
will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the charter
or by-Laws of Purchaser, or (ii) violate any provision of    
-29-   Law, statute, rule or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction,
permit, judgment or decree of any court or other governmental or regulatory
authority applicable to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser makes no representation or warranty as to the enforceability of the
Deed Restriction.   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 9.2(b), no filing
with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
court or tribunal, or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency
or authority is necessary for the execution and delivery by Purchaser of
this Agreement or any other documents contemplated by this Agreement or
the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Except as set forth in Schedule 9.2(b), no consent or approval by,
or any notification of or filing with any Person is required in connection
with the execution, delivery, and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement
or any other documents contemplated by this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   9.3. Brokers. No agent,
broker, investment banker, Person or firm acting on behalf of Purchaser or
under the authority of Purchaser is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or
finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee directly or indirectly
from any of the parties hereto other than Purchaser in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   9.4. Funding of Purchase Price. JLG
has senior credit lines totaling $175,000,000. Consent of the lender parties
to such credit lines is required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Assuming such consent is obtained, such credit lines
together with JLG\'s existing cash balances are sufficient to enable JLG to
fund Purchaser\'s obligation to pay the Closing Payment and the Note Payment.
Purchaser has no reason to believe that the requisite consent of the lender
parties to the credit lines will not be obtained on a timely basis to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE

This Article XII contains the covenants and agreements of the parties with
respect to (a) the status of employment of the Employees, and (b) employee
benefit plans.   12.2. Employment Status: Purchaser shall offer employment,
on terms that Purchaser believes are reasonably comparable or superior to
those currently provided by Seller, to all of the Employees who are actively
employed in the Business on the Closing Date, it being agreed that employees
who are on layoff and who have a right to return to work in the Business or
who are on short-term (up to six months) medical disability (including
pregnancy leave) (and who are listed on Schedule 12.2) are to be considered
actively employed but that employees on long-term medical disability (and who
are listed on Schedule 12.2) and employees whose employment has     
-34-   terminated or will terminate prior to the Closing Date without any
right to return to work are not to be considered actively employed. For the
purposes of this Agreement (i) the terms "layoff", "right to return to work",
"short-term disability", "long-term disability", and "pregnancy leave" shall
be construed in accordance with the personnel policies of the Business and
the collective bargaining agreements covering Employees as of the Closing
Date, and (ii) Employees who are actively employed in the Business on the
Closing Date shall be referred to as "Included Employees." Employees who
accept Purchaser\'s offer of employment are hereinafter collectively called
"Transferred Employees." Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause the
Transferred Employees to become employees of Purchaser as of the Closing
Date, which reasonable efforts shall include affording Purchaser reasonable
opportunities to review employment and personnel records of Employees, to
discuss with Employees terms and conditions of employment with Purchaser as
of the Closing Date and to distribute to the Transferred Employees forms and
documents relating to employment with Purchaser. Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser as of the Closing Date all personnel files relating to Transferred
Employees.   12.3. Former Employees: Purchaser shall assume the benefits
liabilities for Former Employees (including Employees who are on long-term
disability as of the Closing Date) to the extent described on Schedule 12.3,
being consistent with those benefits provided by Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller prior to the Closing Date. Schedule 12.3 contains a true and complete
list of all Former Employees eligible for welfare benefits of any kind
(including, without limitation, retiree health or life insurance, severance
benefits, and continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and
Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA and similar state Laws), and a complete
description of the benefits such Former Employees are eligible to receive
from and after the Closing Date. Seller shall retain all other liabilities
for Former Employees (including Employees on long-term disability as of the
Closing Date).   12.4. Defined Contribution Plans: As of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall assume the sponsorship and assets and liabilities related to
the Union Savings Plan and the OmniQuip Savings Plan. Seller agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in assuming the sponsorship and
assets and liabilities related to such plans, including adoption of any
amendments to such plans and related trust agreements, annuity contracts, or
other funding vehicles.   12.5. Union Contract(s): Seller shall perform all
obligations under all collective bargaining agreements between Seller and any
labor organization that are included in the Assigned Contracts that are
required to be performed prior to the Closing Date. All such collective
bargaining agreements are identified on Schedule 8.13. Purchaser acknowledges
that at Closing it will become a successor employer under such collective
bargaining agreements and agrees to assume, perform and discharge all
obligations of Seller arising under such agreements after the Closing
Date.   12.6. Vacation and WARN Act Liability: Purchaser shall
assume, discharge, pay and be solely liable for all obligation, cost or
expense for:   (a) any earned vacation or holiday pay relating to
Transferred Employees actively employed in the Business on the Closing Date
and reflected on the Closing Statement of Net     -35-   Assets
Acquired, together with any salaried employees holiday pay for
such Transferred Employees;   (b) any Claim or liability relating to
Included Employees actively employed in the Business on the Closing Date
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification ("WARN") Act, arising
from or relating to actions required by this Agreement, and any Claim or
liability under the WARN Act relating to Transferred Employees terminated by
Purchaser after the Closing Date; and   (c) any health, disability or life
insurance coverage and any medical and dental benefits payable at any time to
Transferred Employees actively employed in the Business on the Closing Date
and their eligible dependents to the extent disclosed on Schedule
12.6(c).   12.7. Health Care Continuation Coverage: Purchaser shall
assume, discharge, pay and be solely liable for any and all of Seller\'s
obligations for continued health coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and
Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA and similar state Laws (and any proposed,
temporary or final rules and regulations issued thereunder) with respect to
(i) Transferred Employees and (ii) Former Employees listed on Schedule
12.3.   12.8. Welfare Benefit Plans - Interim Services: Seller agrees, as
an accommodation to Purchaser and if requested by Purchaser at the Closing,
to continue to operate its medical, dental, life insurance and disability
plans (except for union employee medical and dental benefits provided by
Midwest Security, which contract shall be assumed by Purchaser as of the
Closing) for the benefit of the Former Employees and Transferred Employees
during an interim period (the "Interim Period") commencing on the Closing
Date, or, if later, the date the Employee becomes a Transferred Employee and
ending, for each such benefit, on the earlier of a date specified by
Purchaser for each benefit or December 31, 2003. The purpose of this
arrangement is to facilitate benefit coverage until Purchaser is able to
establish successor plans for the Transferred Employees. The parties agree
that Purchaser is fully responsible for all liabilities and benefits which
arise after the Closing Date as the result of the continued operation of
these plans for the Business, including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment
of all such benefits that are payable after the Closing. Therefore, it is the
intent of the parties that the financial obligations of Seller under this
Section 12.8 shall be measured as of the Closing Date as if this continuation
provision did not exist except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.
Further, this Section 12.8 shall not be construed to impose upon Seller any
liability or responsibility under Seller\'s or the Business\' plans except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Any such plans operated by Seller
shall be provided to all eligible Transferred Employees. These benefits shall
be identical to the benefits afforded such individuals under the applicable
Seller\'s plans immediately prior to the Closing Date except as may be
required by Law. During the Interim Period, such benefits shall be provided
to those individuals through Seller\'s and, as applicable, the
Business\' existing plans. Purchaser agrees to pay Seller, or if so
determined by Seller, any administrative representative of Seller, the
premium rates and other direct costs actually payable or incurred under, or
contributions made to, Seller\'s or the Business\' welfare benefit plans
maintained by Seller at the request of Purchaser under this Section 12.8 for
the Transferred Employees plus any reasonable third party administrative
service fees related to such premiums or direct costs as well as any
reasonable and necessary related expenses incurred by Guarantor for any such
continued coverage thereunder.      -36-    12.9. Wage and Tax
Reporting: In accordance with the "Alternate Procedure" provided in Section 5
of Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399, with respect to filing and
furnishing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2, W-3 and 941, from and after
the Closing Date (a) Seller and Purchaser shall report on a "predecessor-
successor" basis with respect to the Transferred Employees, (b) Seller shall
be relieved of furnishing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2 to such
Transferred Employees to whom it would have been obligated to furnish
such forms for the calendar year of the Closing, and (c) Purchaser shall
assume the obligations of Seller to furnish such forms to such Transferred
Employees for such calendar year.   12.10. Worker\'s Compensation Claims:
Schedule 12.10 contains a true and complete list of all Claims pending as of
the Closing Date resulting from work-related actual or alleged harm or injury
to Transferred Employees or Former Employees. Purchaser shall assume
liability for all Claims listed on Schedule 12.10 , together with any such
Claims commenced after the Closing Date resulting from incidents or accidents
occurring either before or after the Closing Date.   12.11. Long-Term
Incentive Compensation: Seller shall retain liability for payment of
incentive compensation to Transferred Employees pursuant to Textron\'s Long-
Term Incentive Plan of 1999 paid in Seller\'s sole discretion for periods
ending prior to the Closing.   12.12. Retention Agreements: After the
Closing Date Purchaser shall assume liability for any payments required to be
made pursuant to the agreements listed on Schedule 12.12 and provided to
Purchaser or Purchaser\'s counsel as required by Section 8.9(c).   ARTICLE
XIII  OBLIGATIONS AFTER CLOSING   13.1. Non-Competition:   (a) Seller,
for itself and its Affiliates, agrees for a period of two years following the
Closing Date, not to carry on or be engaged in the manufacture or sale of
telescopic material handlers of the type manufactured or sold by the Business
prior to the Closing Date (the "Restricted Business"). Notwithstanding the
above, the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to prohibit Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller, from (i) acquiring not more than ten percent of the
outstanding voting capital stock of a Person engaged in the Restricted
Business, whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or through
the automated quotation system of a registered securities association; (ii)
acquiring greater than ten percent of the outstanding capital voting stock of
a Person engaged in the Restricted Business where the revenues derived by
the acquired party from the Restricted Business do not exceed twenty-five
percent of the acquired party\'s annual revenues or twenty-five million
dollars annually, whichever is greater; (iii) selling or providing products
or services of a kind currently sold or provided by Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller other than the Business; (iv) selling or providing products of a
kind sold or provided by the Business that have been repossessed, taken in
trade-in or otherwise recovered pursuant to any type of financing agreement
or arrangement; (v) to the extent excluded pursuant to the terms of Section
6.2, lease, sale, licensing, or other transfer of any Excluded Asset; or (vi)
acquiring any Person engaged in the Restricted Business so long as Purchaser
is given an immediate and continuing option for an option period of one
hundred     -37-   twenty (120) calendar days, to commit to acquire
such portion of the acquired business engaged in the Restricted Business from
Seller or its Affiliate. If Purchaser so commits, closing shall occur within
thirty (30) calendar days thereafter. If Purchaser does not so commit or
close the transaction within such 30-day period, Seller or its Affiliate may
continue to operate such business without being in violation of this Section
13.1. The exercise price for such option shall be an amount equal to the
aggregate purchase price, including liabilities assumed, paid by Seller or
its Affiliate for its interest in the Person engaged in the Restricted
Business, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the net
operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the portion
of the acquired business engaged in the Restricted Business during the most
recently completed fiscal year prior to the date of Seller\'s or Seller\'s
Affiliate\'s acquisition and the denominator of which shall be the net
operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the
entirety of the acquired business during the same period. The purchase by
Purchaser would be subject to the execution by Seller or its Affiliate and
Purchaser of a mutually satisfactory definitive agreement for
such purchase.   (b) It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing
covenants in this Section 13.1 impose a reasonable restraint on the
Seller.   (c) The covenants in this Section 13.1 are severable
and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not
affect the provisions of any other covenant. Moreover, in the event any court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial
restrictions set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the
parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the
court deems reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed.  
13.2. Access: In connection with any of the Retained Liabilities or
any financial audit of Seller or any Claim or other governmental
investigation of Seller for any matter relating to any period prior to the
Closing, or for any other reasonable and lawful purpose, Purchaser shall,
upon request, permit Seller and its representatives to have access, at
reasonable times during normal business hours and in a manner which is not
unreasonably disruptive to the operations of Purchaser, to the Purchased
Records and work papers, books and records of Purchaser relating to the
Business. Purchaser shall maintain in an orderly manner, and shall not
dispose of, the Purchased Records or such work papers, books and records
during the six year period beginning with the Closing without Seller\'s
consent. Following the expiration of such six-year period, Purchaser may
dispose of the Purchased Records or such work papers, books and records at
any time upon giving 90 calendar days\' prior written notice to Seller,
unless Seller agrees to take possession thereof within such 90 calendar days
at no expense to Purchaser.   13.3. Tax Matters:   (a) Allocation of
Taxes. Except as expressly set forth in Section 13.3(b) and Section 13.3(c),
Seller shall be responsible for, and will cause to be included in its
Returns, all liabilities of Seller for Taxes, including, but not limited to,
all Taxes arising out of or relating to the    -38-   operation of the
Business or the Purchased Assets for all periods or portions thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") . Except as
expressly set forth in Section 13.3(b) and Section 13.3(c), Purchaser shall
be responsible for, and will cause to be included in its Returns,
all liabilities of Purchaser for Taxes arising out of or relating to the
operation of the Business or the Purchased Assets for all periods or portions
thereof commencing after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"). For
purposes of determining each party\'s liability for Taxes arising out of or
relating to the operation of the Business or the Purchased Assets, the
Closing Date shall be treated as the last day of a taxable period, whether or
not the taxable period in fact ends on the Closing Date.   (b) Property
Taxes.   (i) Apportionment. For purposes of this Agreement, real and 
personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes (collectively, 
"Property Taxes") for a period that includes but does not end on the  Closing
Date (a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between Seller  and Purchaser
based upon the number of days of such period that are in  the Pre-Closing Tax
Period (which period shall include the Closing  Date) and the number of days
of such period that are in the  Post-Closing Tax Period. In performing such
apportionment, all Property  Taxes shall be pro-rated based on an equal
amount of Property Tax being  applied to each day of the Straddle Period,
notwithstanding the billing  or payment of any installment payments. Seller
shall be liable for all  such Property Taxes apportioned to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and  Purchaser shall be liable for all such Property Taxes
apportioned to  the Post-Closing Tax Period   (ii) Return Filing and
Payment Responsibility. With respect to  any Property Tax Return for a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall prepare  and file any such Property Tax
Return and pay any Property Tax  reflected on such Property Tax Return;
provided, however, that Seller  shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for any
Property Tax for a  Pre-Closing Tax Period (calculated in accordance with
Section  13.3(b)(i)) reflected on such Property Tax Return. Purchaser shall 
permit Seller and its advisors to review and comment on each such  Property
Tax Return prior to filing and shall make such revisions to  such Property
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller.   (c) Transfer and Sales
Taxes. Purchaser shall pay all transfer Taxes, sales Taxes and other similar
Taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred by reason of the transfer of
the Purchased Assets by Seller to Purchaser hereunder up to an amount not to
exceed $25,000. Seller shall pay all Transfer Taxes in excess of such amount.
The parties shall cooperate in providing any information and documentation
necessary to obtain any available exemptions from such Transfer Taxes. Solely
for purposes of recording the transfers of the Real Property included among
the Purchased Assets, filing any related Real Property Transfer Tax Returns
and determining any related Real Property Transfer Tax, Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat the net book values of such Real Property as determined for
purposes of the Reference Statement of Net Assets Acquired as the
consideration for such Real Property. Solely for purposes of recording the
transfers of the Real Property included among the Purchased Assets, filing
any related Real Property Transfer Tax Returns and determining any related
Real Property Transfer Tax, Seller and Purchaser agree to treat the net book
values of such Real Property as determined for purposes of the Reference
Statement of Net Assets Acquired as the consideration for such Real
Property.   (d) Survival of Covenants. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the covenants contained in Section 4.5, this Section 13.3
and Section 15.3, the representations     -39-   and warranties
contained in Section 8.12 and the indemnification obligations with respect
thereto shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (including any applicable
extensions thereof).   13.4. Ownership of the Business; Use of Purchased
Records: Except as permitted in the next succeeding sentence, neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall, after the Closing Date, expressly or impliedly convey
the impression that Seller continues to own the Business. Purchaser agrees
that, no later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, it will not
distribute any Purchased Records without over-printing or stickering the same
to show Purchaser as the owner and source thereof. Purchaser shall produce
its own trade literature, brochures, bulletins, labels, stationery, websites,
molds, and/or dies which do not contain the name "Textron" as soon as
practicable and in any event within six months after the Closing Date. In
addition to any other indemnification provisions contained herein, Purchaser
specifically agrees to indemnify Seller and Seller\'s Affiliates against and
hold it harmless from any damage, loss, claim, or suit (and related expenses)
arising from the use by Purchaser of trade literature, brochures, bulletins,
labels, stationery, and promotional content contained on websites to the
extent the foregoing is included in the Purchased Assets.   13.5. Further
Assurances: From time to time after the Closing, without further
consideration, the parties shall cooperate with each other and shall execute
and deliver instruments of transfer or assignment, or such other documents to
the other party as such other party reasonably may request to evidence or
perfect Purchaser\'s right, title and interest to the Purchased Assets, and
otherwise carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   13.6.
Guarantee: Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
terminate the Textron guarantee identified on Schedule 2.1(n), a true and
complete copy of which has been provided to Purchaser, and arrange
for Purchaser to assume Textron\'s obligations under the guarantee as soon
as possible after the Closing Date.   13.7. Former Product Lines: Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing to remove from the
Purchased Assets any proprietary information related to Seller\'s former
Snorkel and skid steer loader product lines, and shall, prior to the Closing,
cause all services in respect of such product lines performed by any Included
Employee to be performed by other personnel of Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller. Purchaser covenants and agrees that, in the event that Seller
inadvertently fails to remove any such proprietary information from the
Purchased Assets, Purchaser and its Affiliates, as applicable, will return
such information to Seller upon its discovery and shall not, to the knowledge
of Purchaser\'s officers or sales and marketing personnel, make use of such
proprietary information or disclose such proprietary information to third
parties.   13.8. Post-Closing Payments: At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay
Seller the amounts set forth on Schedule 13.8, which amounts represent
Seller\'s estimate (the "Estimated Payment") for the first month following
the Closing Date of payments to be made by Seller relating to obligations
assumed by Purchaser hereunder, as set forth in detail on Schedule 13.8. For
the applicable time periods set forth on such Schedule 13.8, Purchaser shall
pay Seller an amount equal to the then-applicable portion of the Estimated
Payment (as such estimate may be revised from time to time by Seller) each
month after the Closing Date no later than the fifteenth day of    
-40-   the month. Seller shall revise the Estimated Payment from time to
time to account for differences between Estimated Payments made by Purchaser
and actual payments made by Seller on Purchaser\'s behalf for Assumed
Liabilities, and the parties shall true up the balance of payments on a
quarterly basis. Estimated Payments not received by Seller by the fifteenth
day of each month shall bear interest through the date that Seller receives
the Estimated Payment at a rate equal to JLG\'s blended borrowing rate on
interest-bearing debt for Purchaser\'s most recently completed fiscal
quarter. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no more frequently
than every thirty (30) days, (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to charge Seller
for (and may offset such amounts against any Estimated Payments or any other
payments due Seller hereunder) any payments made by Purchaser or Purchaser\'s
Affiliates relating to obligations retained by Seller hereunder (including
without limitation any payments in respect of any Retained Liabilities), and
(b) Seller shall be entitled to charge Purchaser for (and may offset such
amounts against any payments due Purchaser hereunder) any payments made by
Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates relating to obligations assumed by Purchaser
hereunder (including without limitation any payments in respect of
any Assumed Liabilities) other than such obligations that are included in
the Estimated Payment.   13.9. Post-Closing Assistance. Purchaser shall
promptly forward to Seller any amounts received by Purchaser or its
Affiliates in respect of the accounts and notes receivable relating to
Snorkel and Seller\'s former skid steer loader product line within 180 days
after the Closing Date; provided, that neither Purchaser nor any of
Purchaser\'s Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation to undertake
any collection activity of such accounts and notes receivable on Seller\'s
behalf.   13.10. TFC Matters. Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Affiliates shall
be prohibited from selling any Products other than spare parts to any debtor
to TFC who is and remains in payment default not disputed by the debtor in
good faith for more than thirty (30) calendar days after notice is delivered
by TFC to such debtor and to Purchaser with respect to any and all amounts
due to TFC pursuant to financing provided by TFC to said debtor related to
the prior sale of Seller\'s or Snorkel\'s product. The prohibition contained
in the preceding sentence shall be effective only after Purchaser has
received actual notice of such debtor\'s continued delinquency following such
thirty (30) calendar day period.   13.11. Delivery of Financial Statements.
Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall furnish, or shall cause Ernst and
Young LLP (or another "Big Four" accounting firm selected by mutual agreement
of Seller and Purchaser) to furnish, to JLG, at JLG\'s expense, (a) an
audited consolidated balance sheet and audited statements of net income and
cash flow of the Business as of and for the period ended December 28, 2002,
in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP, (b) such quarterly unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and unaudited statements of net income and cash
flow of the Business as JLG may reasonably request, in each case prepared in
accordance with GAAP (subject to year-end adjustments and excluding
footnotes), and (c) such consents and approvals as JLG may reasonably request
with respect to the foregoing in order to enable JLG to include such
financial statements in any filings made pursuant to applicable Laws. Seller
shall provide the information that Ernst and Young LLP (or such other "Big
Four" accounting firm) advises is required by JLG, and Seller shall have
no liability to JLG for any Loss incurred by JLG from any Claim made by or
against JLG arising from any use by JLG of financial statements provided
pursuant to this Section 13.11.     -41-    ARTICLE XIV  NOTICES

662-6291   ARTICLE XV  COOPERATION   15.1. Cooperation by Purchaser: In
the event Seller is required to defend against, or desires to prosecute, any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of a claim pertaining to the business
or operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide such assistance and cooperation, including, without limitation,
witnesses and documentary or other evidence as may reasonably be requested by
Seller in connection with its defense. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance
and cooperation.   15.2. Cooperation by Seller: In the event Purchaser is
required to defend against, or desires to prosecute, any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of a claim pertaining to a liability

relating to the business or operations of the Business, Seller shall provide
such assistance and cooperation, including without limitation, witnesses and
documentary or other evidence, as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser in
connection with its defense. Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance.  
15.3. Cooperation on Tax, Accounting and Other Matters:   (a) Purchaser and
Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and
records) and assistance relating to the Business as is reasonably necessary

the Returns, documents and records relating to the assets and properties of
both) until thirty (30) days after the applicable statute of limitations
under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all properly claimed and
valid extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the
compliance with all record retention agreements entered into with any
governmental or taxing authority. Purchaser and Seller agree to give each
other reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other, at its own
cost and expense, the opportunity to remove and take possession of such books
and records.   (c) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the Business for
any Tax.   (d) Seller will reimburse Purchaser for all out-of-pocket-costs
which the Purchaser may reasonably incur pursuant to this Section 15.3 in
assisting Seller and Purchaser will reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket-
costs which the Seller may reasonably incur pursuant to this Section 15.3 in
assisting Purchaser.   ARTICLE XVI  INDEMNIFICATION   16.1.
Indemnification by Seller: Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its directors,
shareholders, officers, employees, agents, consultants, representatives,
Affiliates, successors and assigns (each, a "Purchaser Indemnified Party")
from and against any and all Losses which any of them may incur arising out
of or in connection with:   (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or any
certificate, instrument or other document delivered by Seller hereunder or
thereunder or in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby;     -43-    (b) the non-fulfillment of
any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement;   (c) the
failure of Seller to comply with any Laws applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   (d) the Retained Liabilities; and   (e)
any liability arising from, related to or connected with any Environmental
Law or Restoration Covenant and relating to or arising from or in connection
with (A) the ownership, lease, use or operation by Seller (or any previous
owner or operator) of the Real Property or Purchased Assets, (B)
any Hazardous Substance at, on or under any Real Property on or before the
Closing Date or at, on or under any other property owned, operated, used or
leased by Seller in connection with the Business, and (C) any Contamination
existing and caused by or allegedly caused by any Hazardous Substance
migrated from, generated at, or transferred, disposed, released or
transported at or from the Real Property, or any other property owned,
leased, used or operated by Seller in connection with the Business, or
otherwise caused or contributed to by Seller regardless, in each case,
whether Seller knew or had reason to know of the events, conditions or
circumstances causing or allegedly causing such liability ("Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability") provided, however, that Seller shall have no
obligation under this section 16.1(e) to indemnify Purchaser
for Contamination that Seller demonstrates was caused after the closing date
by Purchaser or its agent.   16.2. Indemnification by Purchaser: Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its directors, shareholders,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, Affiliates,
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") from and against
any and all Losses which any of them may incur arising out of or in
connection with:   (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation
or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any certificate,
instrument or other document delivered by Purchaser hereunder or thereunder
or in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby;   (b) the non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement
made by Purchaser in this Agreement;   (c) the failure of Purchaser to
comply with any Laws applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and   (d) the Assumed Liabilities.   16.3. Environmental
Procedures.   (a) With respect to any Environmental Response Actions at
or in connection with any Real Property for which Seller is required under
this Article XVI to indemnify, Seller shall retain control of any activities
related to investigative or remedial actions that are Seller\'s
responsibility under this Agreement including, without limitation, reporting
to Government Entities, retention of any environmental consultants, and
selection of the method of investigation     -44-   and remediation so
long as Seller\'s actions are in compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws and provided that Seller takes reasonable measures so as to limit the
impact of its activities on the operation of the Business and
not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business, and
provided, further, that Purchaser may refuse access for activities that would
require the shutdown of the Business. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller
and support Seller\'s efforts by:   (i) providing Seller (and its agents
and contractors)  with reasonable access, including use of utilities, to
the  Real Property to conduct investigative and remedial  activities,
including the installation and maintenance of  equipment;   (ii)
coordinating with Seller any redevelopment or  alteration that may impact any
equipment installed by Seller  in connection with an Environmental Response
Action so as to  mitigate any impact on the Seller\'s activities and by 
otherwise not intentionally taking any action that would  exacerbate
environmental conditions at the Real Property,  provided that Seller takes
reasonable measures so as to limit  the impact of its activities on the
operation of the Business  and Seller will not unreasonably interfere with
the operation  of the Business and that Purchaser may refuse access for 
activities that would require the shutdown of the Business;  and   (iii)
providing Seller with any relevant records or  documents requested by the
Seller.   (b) Seller\'s indemnity obligations under this section
shall extend only to Environmental Response Actions to the extent required to
comply with the conditions of the Lease (in accordance with the terms of such
Lease as of the Closing Date), with Environmental Laws, with the requirements
of state and federal regulatory agencies, or with the requirements of any
judicial or administrative order or any settlement agreement to which Seller
or Sellers affiliate is a party or that has been approved by Seller or
Sellers affiliate, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that Purchaser agrees that it will not seek the application of non-
commercial or industrial remediation standards to any such Environmental
Response Action.   (c) Purchaser agrees that it will not precipitate
the commencement of a claim for which indemnification is required under this
Article by conducting excavation or soil or groundwater sampling, but nothing
herein shall preclude Purchaser from conducting excavation as it determines
in its reasonable discretion is needed for the conduct of the Business or to
comply with applicable Law; provided that such excavation shall be done in
accordance with the applicable Lease and Purchaser shall use its best
reasonable efforts to minimize the extent of the excavation.   (d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, Seller shall have no
responsibility (i) to perform, nor financial liability in connection with,
the first one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in Environmental Response
Actions at any individual Real Property that would otherwise be the
obligation of the Seller hereunder, and such work shall be performed by
Purchaser and such costs shall be borne by or on behalf of Purchaser; (ii) to
indemnify     -45-   Purchaser with respect to a Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability affecting or arising from an individual Leased Real
Property initially raised in a Notice of Claim delivered after the first
anniversary of the termination of such Lease, (iii) to indemnify Purchaser
for any Loss solely attributable to diminution in market value of
Purchaser\'s leasehold interest in such Real Property, or (iv) to indemnify
Purchaser to the extent that the Contamination giving rise to the liability
was caused by Purchaser, or an agent or Affiliate of Purchaser. With respect
to Environmental Response Actions that are controlled by Purchaser hereunder
Purchaser shall consult with Seller prior to committing to or implementing
such Environmental Response Actions and shall reasonably consider Seller\'s
comments in connection therewith. With respect to Environmental Response
Actions that are controlled by Seller hereunder Seller shall
provide Purchaser reports concerning the progress of such Environmental
Response Actions upon Purchaser\'s reasonable request.   (e) Seller\'s
indemnification obligations in respect of Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities under this Article shall be enforceable by a transferee of
Purchaser\'s interest in any Real Property only to the extent that such
transferee adheres in all respects to the terms of this Section 16.3.   (f)
The provisions under this Article shall be Purchaser\'s exclusive remedy
against Seller under this Agreement with regard to Environmental Response
Actions during the periods prescribed in Section 16.3 (d).   (g) The
obligations of Seller under this Article XVI are conditioned upon
Purchaser\'s substantial compliance with Sections 16.3(a)(ii), 16.3(b), and
16.3(c). In addition to any other remedies available to Seller, Purchaser
shall be liable to Seller for any incremental cost to Seller due
to Purchaser\'s failure to comply with any other provision of this Section
16.3.   (h) Except as specifically provided for in this Section
16.3, nothing in this Section 16.3 shall diminish or otherwise limit
Seller\'s obligations with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental
Liability.   16.4. Indemnification Procedure:   (a) Any party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitee") shall notify the parties liable
for such indemnification (each an "Indemnitor") in writing of any event,
omission or occurrence which the Indemnitee has determined has given or could
give rise to Losses which are indemnifiable hereunder (such written notice
being hereinafter referred to as a "Notice of Claim"). Such notice shall be
given promptly after the Indemnitee becomes aware of its own claim or that of
a third party; provided, that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as
provided in this Section 16.4 shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations under this Article XVI unless such failure shall materially
prejudice the defense of any such Loss. A Notice of Claim shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and any particulars of the event, omission or
occurrence giving rise to a right of indemnification. The Indemnitor shall
satisfy its obligations hereunder, as the case may be, within 30
calendar days of its receipt of a Notice of Claim; provided, however, that so
long as the Indemnitor is in good faith defending a claim pursuant to Section
16.4(b) below, its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect
thereto shall be suspended.     -46-    (b) With respect to any third
party claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding which is the subject of a
Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor shall, in good faith and at its own expense,
defend, contest or otherwise protect against any such claim, demand, suit,
action or proceeding with legal counsel of its own selection. The Indemnitee
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own
expense, in the defense thereof through counsel of its own choice and shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all cross claims or
counterclaims it may have; provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for such Indemnitee there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such
Indemnitee in connection with such defense. So long as the Indemnitor is
defending in good faith any such third party claim, demand, suit, action or
proceeding, the Indemnitee shall at all times cooperate, at its own expense,
in all reasonable ways with, make its relevant files and records available
for inspection and copying by, and make its employees available or otherwise
render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnitor. In the event that
the Indemnitor fails to timely defend, contest or otherwise protect against
any such third party claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest,
assert cross claims or counterclaims, or otherwise protect against, the same
and may make any compromise or settlement thereof and be entitled to all
amounts paid as a result of such third party claim, demand, suit or action or
any compromise or settlement thereof. The Indemnitor shall not, except with
the consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons
asserting such claim to all Indemnitees of an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of a judgment.  
16.5. Calculation of Losses. The term "Losses" as used in this Article XVI is
not limited to matters asserted by third parties, but includes
Losses incurred or sustained by an Indemnitee in the absence of any third
party claims. The amount of any Losses shall be calculated (a) net of
insurance proceeds paid with respect thereto or any indemnification or
contribution received from and third person and (b) after the effect of any
net Tax benefits actually realized in connection with such Losses. The amount
of any Losses shall be increased to take account of any net Tax costs
incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of any payment hereunder
(grossed up for such increase). The Indemnitee expressly agrees to promptly
notify the applicable insurance carrier of any such claim or loss and tender
defense thereof to such carrier, and shall also promptly notify any potential
third party indemnitor or contributor which may be liable for any portion of
such losses or claims. The Indemnitee agrees to pursue, at the cost and
expense of the Indemnitor, such claims diligently and to reasonably
cooperate, at the costs and expense of the Indemnitor, with each applicable
insurance carrier and third party indemnitor or contributor. The Indemnitee
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to seek recoveries under
insurance policies and shall reimburse the Indemnitor for any
Losses indemnified by it which are subsequently recovered by the Indemnitee
under any such insurance. For purposes of this Agreement, an Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to have actually realized a net Tax benefit or incurred
a net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes
payable by such Indemnitee is reduced below or increased above, as the case
may be, the amount of Taxes that such Indemnitee would be required to pay but
for the accrual or receipt of, the suffering or incurrence of, or payment of
such Losses, each as the case may be.     -47-    16.6. Indemnity
Payments. Any payment of Losses hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment
to Purchase Price. Any payment by Seller hereunder shall first be made by
reducing the outstanding principal, interest, and penalties (if any) due
pursuant to the Promissory Note.   16.7. Closing Statement Claims Not
Losses: Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
have any obligation pursuant to this Article XVI to defend, indemnify or hold
harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, from or against any Losses that any of them may incur that also
constitute Closing Statement Claims, and neither party shall have any
obligations to the other with respect to any Closing Statement Claim other
than pursuant to Article IV hereof.   16.8. Expiration. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 16.3, Seller\'s indemnification and reimbursement
obligations arising out of this Article XVI shall expire sixty (60) days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, or upon the
expiration of the applicable representation or warranty in the case of an
alleged breach thereof not asserted prior to such expiration.   ARTICLE

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on

and to perform the obligations to be performed by it hereunder, and to

to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing, in all
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
