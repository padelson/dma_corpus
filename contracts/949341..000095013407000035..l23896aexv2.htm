practicable, but in no event later than three (3)&nbsp;Business Days, after the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing), or such other time and date that the parties agree to in writing. The Closing shall be
held at the offices of Locke Liddell &#038; Sapp LLP in Dallas, Texas unless another place is agreed to

applicable law. The defense of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation that is subject to
this Section&nbsp;6.6 shall be conducted by legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Parties and to the Company (or the Surviving Corporation and the Parent after the Effective Time).
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section&nbsp;6.6(a), upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and,
