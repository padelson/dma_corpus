 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 29, 2006 (this "Agreement"), among CheckFree Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), CFA Software Corporation, a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Carreker Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Shares"), not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, will be exchanged for $8.05 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"); and 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as soon as practicable, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days, after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or such other time and date that the parties agree to in writing. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Locke Liddell and Sapp LLP in Dallas, Texas unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. As part of the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger (in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger, or such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective Time"). 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to provide the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the name of the Company), and shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Certificate of Incorporation. 

   

 (b) The By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws. 

   

 Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities 

  

 (a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.4, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share; 

   

 (b) each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (c) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) The Company has awarded stock options and restricted shares under (i) the Companys Director Stock Option Plan and (ii) the Companys Third Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended through the date of this Agreement, collectively referred to as the "Company Stock Plans"). Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time) subject to the terms of Section 2.2(b) to (A) terminate the Company Stock Plans and (B) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested or exercisable, as of such date (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any Subsidiary). 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. No holder of a Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled Company Stock Option before or after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Award"), the restrictions of which have not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

   

 (d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of the Company shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of   ##### 

  

  

  

such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.4,
of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, shall deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(a) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered   ##### 

  

  

  

holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Merger Sub that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender such holders
Certificates because such Certificates have been lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity
bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares
such amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (c) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 

   

 (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

The Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance in all material respects with either the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding comment letters or requests for information from the SEC with respect to any Company SEC Report. No Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC. 

   

 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim statements, the omission of footnotes and otherwise as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein. 

   

 (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected, reserved for or disclosed in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including the notes thereto, prepared as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with GAAP and consistent with the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries as at January 31, 2006, including the notes thereto (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), except for (i) liabilities and obligations that are reflected, reserved for or disclosed in the Latest Balance Sheet or in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries as at October 31, 2006, including the notes thereto, (ii) liabilities and obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since January 31, 2006, (iii) liabilities and obligations that have not had, or which would not   ##### 

  

  

  

reasonably be expected to have either individually or in the aggregate a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) as set forth in Section 3.7(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) The Company has timely filed all certifications and statements required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (y) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to any Company SEC Report. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are designed to ensure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that all material information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys SEC filings and other public disclosure documents. As used in this Section 3.7, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC. 

   

 (e) The Company has disclosed, based on prior evaluations of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since the Latest Balance Sheet. 

   

 (f) The Company has never incurred and does not reasonably expect to incur a charge to earnings due to the failure to report in the appropriate fiscal period the expense related to the issuance of a stock option with an exercise price lower than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The Company does not have any program or practice in place to (i) time stock option grants to employees or directors with the release of material non-public information in a manner intended to improperly favor employees or directors or (ii) set the exercise prices in coordination with such release in a manner intended to improperly favor employees or directors.

Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports or in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation (which investigation has been communicated to the Company or of which the Company has knowledge) (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before any Governmental Authority. Except as set forth in Section 

   ##### 

  

 

3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
nor any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar
written agreement (an "Order") with, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental
Authority.

Except as disclosed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any express or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any Plan, other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination required by this Agreement, the Merger, ERISA, the Code or to otherwise comply with applicable Laws. The Company has expressly reserved its right to amend or terminate each Plan. 

   

 (b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate (including any entity that during the past six years was a ERISA Affiliate) has now or at any time contributed to, sponsored, or maintained (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"), or (iii) a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). No condition exists and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for termination of any Plan, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expect to incur, any material liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA. No "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any Employee Plan, whether or not waived. No "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, and no event described in Section 4041, 4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred in connection with any   ##### 

  

  

  

Employee Plan. Except as disclosed in Section 3.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Plan exists that (A) provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person,
(B) obligates the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to pay
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or
partially as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
(C) could result in the payment to any present or former employee, director
or consultant of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of any money or
other property or accelerate or provide any other special vesting or other
rights or benefits to any current or former employee of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate as a result of the consummation of the Merger (whether alone
or in connection with any subsequent event). Except as disclosed in Section
3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, plan or
arrangement covering any current or former employee of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible, including without
limitation, pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code. Except to the
extent required under ERISA Section 601 _et. seq_. and Code Section 4980B,
none of the Plans provides for or promises medical, group health, disability
or retiree life insurance benefits for a period following retirement or other
termination of employment to any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Except as disclosed in Section
3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Plans is subject only
to the Laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof. 

   

 (c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Plan has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. Except as disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Subsidiaries have performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under, and are not in default in any material respect under or in violation of any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and except as disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries have any knowledge of any fact or event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Action. Except as disclosed in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no material operational or plan failure (within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2003-44) exists with respect to any Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. 

   

 (d) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter or prototype opinion letter upon which the plan sponsor is entitled to rely from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") that the Plan is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such qualification or exemption. 

   

 (e) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance. All contributions and contribution obligations have been reflected on the most recent financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports. 

   

 (g) The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance with the requirements of the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any similar state or local law (the "WARN Act") and have no liabilities pursuant to the WARN Act determined without regard to any terminations of employment that occur on or after the Effective Time. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has complied with all reporting and disclosure obligation to all Governmental Authority and all participants and beneficiaries with respect to each Plan required by the terms of such Plan and any statutes, orders, rules or regulations, including but not limited to ERISA, the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

   

 (h) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the Plans which are "group health plans" under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 607(1) of ERISA, there has been timely compliance in all material respects with all requirements imposed under Section 4980(B) of the Code and Part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA, so that neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any (and will not incur any) loss, assessment, tax penalty, or other sanction with respect to any such Plan. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the Companys Plans which are "group health plans" under Section 9832 of the Code or Section 733 of ERISA, such Plans have been maintained in compliance in all material respects with all requirements imposed under Subtitle K of the Code and Part 7 of Title 1 of ERISA, so that neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any (and will not incur any) loss, assessment, tax penalty, or other sanction with respect to any Plan. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, if the Company or any of its Plans are treated as a "covered entity" under the Privacy and Security Standards at 45 CFR Parts 160 through 164, such covered entities have complied in all material respects with such standards beginning with the effective date of such standards to such covered entities. 

   

 (i) The Company and all ERISA Affiliates have complied with Code Section 409A, including all transitional guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, with respect to any interest granted or awarded pursuant to a Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)), and no person had a legally binding right to an amount under such a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which would subject such person to the taxes imposed by Code Section 409A. 

   

 (j) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Plan listed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that is not subject to United States law (a "Non-U.S. Benefit Plan"), and except as disclosed in Section 3.10(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: 

    ##### 

  

   

 (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or under any agreement between such employer and employee relating thereto have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices; 

   

 (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the benefits determined as if such plan is maintained on an ongoing basis (actual or contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement with respect to all current and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and 

   

 (iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary required to be registered or approved has been registered or approved and has been maintained and administered in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been operated in material compliance with all applicable non-United States Laws. 

   

 (iv) The Company or a Subsidiary may unilaterally amend or terminate any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (subject to the requirements of applicable Laws) and no commitments to improve or otherwise amend any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been made. 

   

 (v) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Non-U.S. Benefit Plan exists that could result in (A) the payment to any employee or former employee of any money or other remuneration; (B) accelerated or increased funding requirements for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan; or (C) the acceleration or provision of any increased rights or benefits to any employee as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (vi) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no employee whose employment is governed by the laws of a country other than the U.S. has any agreement as to length of notice or severance pay required to terminate his employment except as results from the application of relevant laws. 

   

 (vii) There have been no resignations or redundancy dismissals or, to the knowledge of the Company, any threats of resignation, of any of the employees employed in France by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (the French Employees") (A) that have occurred in the six (6) months prior to the date hereof or (B) that will have occurred from the date hereof through the Closing that would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. There is no written or oral employment agreement with French Employees which may not be terminated by the Company by the giving of three months notice or less, or which may give rise to any indemnity payment payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 

   ##### 

  

    

(other than those provided by the applicable statute, regulations and any
collective bargaining agreement). The Company has complied in all material
respects with mandatory statutory provisions, regulations, collective
agreements, collective accords and judicial decisions concerning working
conditions or relations between the Company and its French Employees or any
related representative trade union. The Company pays no moneys in the way of
salary to persons who do not perform any real work for the Company. With
respect to the French Employees, the Company has no optional retirement plan
and has set up no system of participation, interessement, epargne entreprise,
agreement to sell or purchase securities, bonuses or commissions in favor of
all or any of its employees, except as provided under mandatory employee
participation schemes pursuant to statute and regulations. With respect to
the French Employees, the Company has not been found liable in respect of the
performance or termination of any contract of employment for a period of five
(5) years, and the Company has no procedure relating to collective redundancy
dismissals for economic reasons. The Company has complied in all material
respects with statutory and regulatory provisions relating to employee
representative bodies and union sections for its French Employees. As of the
date of this Agreement, no significant industrial dispute that would be
reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has occurred concerning the French Employees in
the course of the last two (2) years and, as of Closing, no such matter has

 (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 6.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary nor any Representative of it or any Subsidiary will, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action for the purpose of facilitating, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined below), or (ii) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with any person or entity for the purpose of facilitating such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction, or (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any Competing Transaction or enter into any letter of intent or other contract, agreement or commitment providing for or otherwise relating to any Competing Transaction, or (iv) authorize or permit any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any such action. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one business day) after the Company receives any oral or written proposal or offer or any inquiry or contact with any person regarding a potential proposal or offer regarding a Competing Transaction, specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal or offer (including material amendments or proposed material amendments). The Company immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, the Company Board may furnish information to, and enter into discussions with, a person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding a Competing Transaction, and the Company Board has (i) determined, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial advisor), that such proposal or offer constitutes or could lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (ii) determined, in its good faith judgment after consulting with its outside legal counsel (who may be the Companys regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that, in light of such proposal or offer, the failure to furnish such information or enter into discussions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions with such person prior to taking any such action and (iv) obtained from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party).

 (c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(c) and subject to Section 8.1(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or its committees of this Agreement or the Merger (a "Change in the Company Recommendation") or approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or obligation with respect to, any Competing Transaction (except for a confidentiality agreement as provided in Section 6.4(b) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment at any time prior to the approval of the Merger by the holders of Shares after consulting with outside legal counsel (who may be the Companys regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that the failure to make a Change in the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may make a Change in the Company Recommendation and/or recommend a Superior Proposal, but only (i) after providing written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that the Company Board intends to effect a Change in the Company Recommendation and (ii) if Parent does not prior to three business days after Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal make an offer that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial advisor), to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal. Any disclosure that the Company Board may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction or otherwise in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of this Agreement or a Change in Company Recommendation. 

   

 (d) A "Competing Transaction" means any of the following (other than the Merger): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or of any Subsidiary; (iii) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition in which the Company or any Subsidiary participates (including by way of taking any action to comply with Section 203 of the DGCL, but excluding typical stock transfer functions) and which results in any person beneficially owning more than 50% of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary; or (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning more than 50% of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary. 

   

 (e) A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited written bona fide offer made by a third party with respect to a Competing Transaction, in each case on terms that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial advisor) and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer that it deems relevant, to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger, and for which financing, to the extent it is a condition of such offer, is then committed; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal" if any financing on which the offer is conditioned is not committed and is not likely in the good faith judgment of 

    ##### 

  

    

the Company Board (after having received the advice of its financial advisor)
to be obtained by such third party on a basis the Company Board deems
timely. 

   

 Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) On and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms (i) the funding obligations arising out of the Merger as set forth in Article II hereof and (ii) all employment agreements and all bonus, retention and severance obligations, of the Company or any Subsidiary, all of which are listed in Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, except as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties thereto, and the Company or Parent shall pay at the Effective Time to the applicable officers and employees listed in said Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, any amounts with respect to such agreements and obligations that are payable by their terms at the Effective Time or upon consummation of the Merger. 

   

 (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries who remain employed by Parent, Merger Sub or their subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") with either (i) the employee benefits maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date or (ii) at least the types and levels of employee benefits (including contribution levels) maintained from time to time by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for similarly-situated employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company or the Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits, including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not, treat any Company Employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing medical condition. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges that, in accordance with Parents policies applicable to all employees of Parent and its subsidiaries, each Company Employee will be required to submit to a drug test and background check immediately subsequent to the Closing and the results of such drug test and background check will be satisfactory to the Parent in order for such Company Employee to continue employment with the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such results. 

   

 (c) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations which accrued prior to the Effective Time under the Plans.

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, 

    ##### 

  

    

employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or
any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii)
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or
document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or thereby whether in any case asserted
or arising at or before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree
to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted
by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding
or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time), the Company, and the Surviving Corporation and
Parent after the Effective Time, shall promptly pay expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law; provided,
however, that none of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have
no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non appealable, that indemnification by such
entities of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law. The defense of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation that is subject to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted by legal
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties and to the Company
(or the Surviving Corporation and the Parent after the Effective Time). Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6(a),
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly
notify materially prejudices such party. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of the Company and the Subsidiaries provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) or indemnification agreements listed in Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub each also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time to the extent provided in the respective charters or
bylaws (or other organizational documents) of the Company and the
Subsidiaries or any written indemnification agreements between the Company
and/or one or more Subsidiaries and such officers and directors as listed in
Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, unless otherwise
prohibited by law. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a non-cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and officers in the same form as presently maintained by the Company, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company. 

   

 (d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnities to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein). 

   

 (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which could be reasonably be expected to cause (i) any Company As-Stated Representation (as defined in the parenthetical contained in Section 7.2(a)(ii)) or Parent As-Stated Representation (as defined in the parenthetical contained in Section 7.3(a)(ii)) to be untrue or inaccurate as stated herein or (ii) any other representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party giving or receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Further Action; Reasonable Commercial Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (a) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger, (b) cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action necessary to terminate the agreement set forth on Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (c)

 (d) by written notice from the Company to Parent, if Parent or Merger Sub (i) breaches in any material respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, or (ii) fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement, in any event which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date;

Subject to Section 8.3(f), the remedy set forth in this Section 8.3(b) shall be Parent and Merger Subs exclusive remedy in the event of the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.1(f). 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all of its Expenses (but not in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, such payment to be made not later than thirty days after submission of statements therefor); provided that, with respect to an event specified in clause (i) of Section 8.1(c), such failure shall be due to any of the representations and warranties of the Company not being true and correct such that the condition in Section 7.2(a) shall have failed as of the date hereof. Subject to Section 8.3(f), the remedy set forth in this Section 8.3(c) shall be Parent and Merger Subs exclusive remedy in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c).

    #####

relief set forth in Section 9.7) in the event of the termination of this

Subject to Section 8.3(f), the remedy set forth in this Section 8.3(e) shall be the Companys exclusive remedy (except for the remedies and relief set forth in Section 9.7) in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g). 

   

 (f) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the amounts payable hereunder are not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the aggrieved party for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and for losses and damages likely to be incurred or suffered as a result of termination in the circumstances described in this Section 8.3, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In the event that a party hereto shall fail to pay an amount specified under this Section 8.3 when due, the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by the party entitled thereto, to the extent such accrued expenses are, in fact, paid (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 8.3. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in the event of willful breach of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
