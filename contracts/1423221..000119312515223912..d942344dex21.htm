insurance contributions including any liability to make any deductions,
withholdings or payments of or on account of national insurance contributions
and any associated liability arising in circumstances where such liability is
not made good by the Individual, but excluding any liability to employers
national insurance contributions. The provisions of this Schedule shall apply
in respect of a liability to Tax under this paragraph 2.2 as if references to
the "Warrantors" in those paragraphs are references to the "Individual". 
---|--- 



   2.3 | Any payments made under this Schedule shall, so far as possible,

the number of companies in the same group as the Company on or following

an enactment or regulation relating to Taxation after Completion, the
anticipated making or giving of which was taken into account in computing the
provision for Taxation in the Locked Box Accounts; or

     | (k) | the Liability to Taxation is a liability against which a
Relief other than any Buyers Relief is available for set off or reduces the
net cost of the Liability to Taxation to the Company; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (l) | such Liability to Taxation results from or is increased by a
change of the accounting reference date of the Company on or after Completion
or by any change after Completion in the accounting policies of the Company
or the basis upon which the Company values its assets after Completion (in

---|--- 



   7.2 | The Buyer shall make reasonable endeavours to agree the documents
referred to in Paragraph 7.1 above with the relevant Tax Authority as soon as
possible and within the time limits prescribed by law. The Warrantors
shall give the Buyer or its agents all such assistance as may reasonably be
required to prepare such documents and agree them with the relevant Tax
Authority (including responding to any enquiry by, and conducting any dispute
with, a Tax Authority). The Warrantors shall make available to the Buyer any
documents or information relating to the Company that are in their possession
if necessary and reasonable for complying with this Paragraph 7. 
---|--- 
 



   8. | DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYMENTS 
---|--- 



   8.1 | All sums payable by the Warrantors to the Buyer under this
Schedule shall be paid free and clear of any set-off, counterclaim, deduction
or withholding whatsoever save only as may be required by law. 
---|--- 
 



   8.2 | If any such deduction or withholding as is referred to in
Paragraph 8.1 above is required by law the Warrantors shall be obliged to: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | pay to the Buyer on demand such additional sum as will,
after such deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Buyer with the
same net amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
such deduction or withholding; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | pay or account for the full amount deducted or withheld to
the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | furnish to the Buyer the original, or a certified copy, of a
receipt or other document evidencing such payment to the relevant Tax
Authority. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8.3 | If any sum payable by the Warrantors to the Buyer under this
Schedule shall be chargeable to Tax by any Tax Authority in the hands of the
Buyer, the same obligation to make an increased payment as is referred to
in Paragraph 8.2 shall apply in relation to such sum as if it were a
deduction or withholding required by law unless the amount payable under this
Schedule relates to an expense which is deductible for corporation tax
purposes. 
---|--- 
 



59 Paragraph 8 in respect of which the Buyer has, having made all reasonable
efforts to do so, obtained the benefit of any tax credit, the Buyer shall
reimburse the Warrantors such amount as will leave the Buyer in the same
position it would have been in had no such increased payment been made. 
---|--- 



   9. | RECOVERING FROM OTHER PERSONS 
---|--- 

If a payment is made by the Warrantors in full discharge of a liability which
has arisen under this Schedule in respect of a Liability to Taxation and the
Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, subsequently recovers from any other
person (other than the Buyer, the Company or any person connected with any of
them for the relevant Taxation purposes) a payment in respect of the Liability
to Taxation, or if the Liability to Taxation in respect of which the
Warrantors have made a payment gives rise to a credit or right to repayment of
Tax for the Company (such payment or credit being received by virtue of a
legal right) that would not have otherwise arisen, the Buyer shall pay or
procure that the Company shall repay to the Warrantors the amount received
(less any reasonable costs and expenses and any Tax paid or payable by or on
behalf of the Buyer or the Company in respect of it) or in respect of which a
credit is given provided always that such amount does not exceed the payment
originally made by the Warrantors.

 



   10. | OVERPROVISIONS, SAVINGS AND REPAYMENTS OF TAX 
---|--- 



   10.1 | If the Buyer or the Company becomes aware of a possible
Overprovision, Saving or right to Repayment, then the Buyer shall notify the
Warrantors of this possibility in writing as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Warrantors may request the relevant Companys auditors (at the cost of
the Warrantors) to certify the amount of such Overprovision, Saving or right
to Repayment. 
---|--- 
 



   10.2 | If the auditors of the relevant Company at any time before 31
December 2019 certify (whether or not following notification under Paragraph
10.1) that there is an Overprovision, Saving or right to a Repayment, then:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | the amount of any Overprovision, Saving or Repayment shall
first be set off against any payment then due from the Warrantors under this
Schedule; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | to the extent that there is an excess, a refund shall be
made to the Warrantors of any previous payment or payments made by the
Warrantors under this Schedule (and not previously refunded under this
Schedule) up to the amount of such excess; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | to the extent that such excess as referred to in Paragraph
10.2(b) is not exhausted, the remainder of that excess shall be carried
forward and set off against any future payment or payments which become due
from the Warrantors under this Schedule. 
---|---|--- 



   10.3 | After the auditors have produced any certificate under this
Paragraph 10, the Warrantors or the Buyer may request the auditors to review
(at the expense of the party making the request) that certificate in the light
of all relevant circumstances, including any facts of which they were not or
it was not aware, and which were not taken into account, at the time when such
certificate was produced, and to certify whether, in their opinion, the
certificate remains correct or whether, in light of those circumstances, it
should be amended. 
---|--- 



   10.4 | If the auditors make an amendment to the earlier certificate and
the amount of the Overprovision is revised, that revised amount shall be
substituted for the previous amount and any adjusting payment that is
required shall be made by or to the Warrantors (as the case may be) as soon
as reasonably practicable. 
---|--- 
 



60 ---|--- 



   11.1 | The Warrantors shall take such action as is necessary, including
co-operating with the Buyer, the Buyers Group, the Company and the
Subsidiaries, to procure that such members of the Retained Group as are
currently within the group of companies for the purposes of sections 43 to
43C VATA 1994 of which Flamstead Holdings Limited is the representative member
(the "Flamstead Holdings VAT Group") are excluded from such group with effect
from Completion or the earliest date permitted thereafter. The Warrantors
shall provide the Buyer with copies of all material correspondence with HMRC
in relation to securing that such members of the Retained Group are excluded
from the Flamstead Holdings VAT Group, and shall keep the Buyer informed of
the progress of the application for exclusion. 
---|--- 



   11.2 | The Warrantors warrant and represent to the Buyer for themselves
and on behalf of the Retained Group that, until the members of the Retained
Group that are members of the Flamstead Holdings VAT Group have been
excluded from such group, the members of the Retained Group shall comply with
all their material VAT obligations. 
---|--- 



   11.3 | As regards supplies made between members of the Retained Group
and third parties on or before the date on which such members of the Retained
Group are excluded from the Flamstead Holdings VAT Group, such payments
shall be made between the Retained Group and the representative member of the
Flamstead Holdings VAT Group as shall ensure that the resulting position for
VAT purposes for the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Retained Group is the
same as it would have been had the members of the Retained Group not been
members of the Flamstead Holdings VAT Group but had been registered as a
separate group for VAT purposes, except that: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | if those supplies are ignored for VAT purposes because they
are made between a member of the Retained Group and another member of the
Flamstead Holdings VAT Group, those supplies shall also be ignored for the
purposes of this paragraph 11; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | no payments shall be made in respect of supplies made before
the Accounts Date where to do so would result in a benefit to, or a liability
of, the Company and/or the Subsidiaries which was not reflected in the
Accounts.  
---|---|--- 



   11.4 | Any payments to be made under paragraph 11 shall be made
promptly following the end of the VAT prescribed accounting period to which
the payments relate. 
---|--- 
 



   12. | BUYERS COVENANT 
---|--- 



   12.1 | The Buyer hereby covenants with the Warrantors to pay to the
Warrantors an amount equal to any Tax for which the Warrantors (or any person,
other than the Company, which is or at any time has been under the control
of, or under the same control as, the Warrantors) are or may be liable,
together with any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Warrantors in
connection with taking any successful action under this Paragraph 12 but only
in circumstances where the Tax is directly or primarily chargeable against
the Company and arises: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | in respect of income, profits or gains earned, accrued or
received in respect of any period after Completion where the liability in
question arises because of the Companys failure to pay Tax on such
income, profits or gains; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | as a result of a failure of the Buyer or the Company to
apply an amount 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | provided for in the Locked Box Accounts; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | paid by the Warrantors to the Buyer under this Schedule or
in satisfaction of a claim for breach of the Tax Warranties 
---|---|--- 
 

to discharge a liability to which the amount relates.



   12.2 | A payment to be made by the Buyer under this Paragraph 12 shall
be made ten Business Days after written demand for such payment. The
provisions of Paragraphs 2.2 and 8 to 10 shall apply as if references to
the "Warrantors" in those Paragraphs were references to the "Buyer" and vice
versa.

63 SCHEDULE 7

 

LIMITATIONS ON CLAIMS



   1. | INTERPRETATION 
---|--- 

The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in
this Schedule.



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    Claim |  | a claim for breach of any of the Warranties. 
   | 
  Substantiated Claim |  | a Claim in respect of which liability is
admitted by the party against whom such Claim is brought, or which has been
adjudicated on by a Court of competent jurisdiction and no right of appeal
lies in respect of such adjudication, or the parties are debarred by passage
of time or otherwise from making an appeal. 
 

A Claim is connected with another Claim or Substantiated Claim if they all
arise out of the occurrence of the same event or relate to the same subject
matter.



   2. | FRAUD 
---|--- 

Nothing in Schedule 7 applies to a claim under this agreement that arises as
a result of dishonesty or fraud by the Warrantors or the Sellers.



   3. | MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY 
---|--- 



   3.1 | The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for all claims
under this agreement when taken together shall not exceed the Purchase Price. 
---|--- 
 



   3.2 | The maximum aggregate liability of the Warrantors under or in
relation to the Warranties (other than the Fundamental Warranties) and the Tax
Covenant shall not exceed the sum set out against their respective names
in column 4 of Schedule 1. 
---|--- 



   4. | RETENTION ACCOUNT 
---|--- 

The Warrantors shall be entitled to require that Claims under the Warranties
and the Tax Covenant are first settled from funds in the Retention Account for
the time being.



   5. | DE MINIMIS 
---|--- 

The Warrantors shall not be liable for a Claim unless:

 



   5.1 | the claim becomes a Substantiated Claim and the amount of that
Substantiated Claim, or of a series of connected Substantiated Claims of which
that Substantiated Claim is one, exceeds £50,000 (fifty thousand pounds); and 
---|--- 



   5.2 | the amount of the Warrantors liability in respect of such Claim
when aggregated with the Warrantors liability for any other Substantiated
Claims that are not excluded under paragraph 5.1 exceeds £500,000 (five
hundred thousand pounds), in which case the Warrantors shall subject always to
paragraph 5.1 be liable for the whole amount claimed and not just the excess
over £500,000. 
---|--- 
 



   6. | TIME LIMITS 
---|--- 



   6.1 | The Warrantors are not liable for a Claim or a claim under the
Tax Covenant unless the Buyer has given the Warrantors notice in writing of
the Claim or the claim under the Tax Covenant, summarising as far as is known
to the Buyer the nature of the Claim or claim under the Tax Covenant and the
amount claimed: 
---|--- 



   6.1.1 | by 31 December 2019 in the case of a claim made under the Tax
Warranties or the Tax Covenant; 
---|--- 
 



64 within the period of 18 months beginning with the Completion Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, there shall be no time limit for any claim made under
the Fundamental Warranties. 
---|--- 



   6.2 | Except with respect to any claim that becomes a Substantiated
Claim, and/or a claim under the Tax Covenant, any Claim notified in accordance
with paragraph 6.1 shall (if not previously satisfied, settled or
withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn (and no new Claim may be made in
respect of the matter, facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim)
unless legal proceedings in respect of the Claim have been issued and fully
served on the Warrantors within twelve months of the date upon which the
notice of the Claim was given in accordance with paragraph 6.1. 
---|--- 



   7. | EXCLUSIONS: AFTER COMPLETION 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the extent that
the matter or circumstance giving rise to such Claim arises, occurs or is
otherwise attributable to, or the Sellers liability pursuant to such Claim is
increased as a result of:

 



   7.1 | any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement of the
Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or their respective directors,
employees or agents) on or after Completion except where such
act, transaction, omission or arrangement was: 
---|--- 



   7.1.1 | carried out or effected pursuant to a legally binding
obligation entered into on or before the date of this agreement; or 
---|--- 



   7.1.2 | in the ordinary course of business of the Company or the
Subsidiaries as carried on at Completion; 
---|--- 



   7.2 | any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried
out at the written request, or with the written consent of the Buyer before
Completion; or 
---|--- 
 



   7.3 | any change after Completion in the accounting bases, policies,
practices or methods applied in preparing any accounts or valuing any assets
or liabilities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (other than a
change made in order to comply with Accounting Standards). 
---|--- 



   8. | EXCLUSIONS: PROVISIONS ETC 
---|--- 

The Warrantors are not liable for a Claim to the extent that:



   8.1 | the Claim relates to any matter specifically provided for in the
Accounts or the Locked Box Accounts; 
---|--- 



   8.2 | any liability thereunder arises or is increased wholly or partly
as a result of any legislation not in force at the date of this agreement
which takes effect retrospectively; 
---|--- 
 



   8.3 | it is a liability for Tax, arising as a result of transactions in
the ordinary course of its business (including distributions or the
acquisition and disposal of capital assets by any of the Company or the
Subsidiaries) since the Accounts Date. 
---|--- 



   9. | THIRD PARTY RECOVERY 
---|--- 



   9.1 | If, in respect of any matter which would give rise to a Claim,
the Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is entitled to make a claim
under any policy of insurance, then the Buyer shall and shall procure that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) shall, use its
reasonable endeavours to make recovery from its insurers. Liability in respect
of any such Claim shall then be reduced by the amount recovered under such
policy of insurance (less all costs, charges and expenses incurred in
recovering that sum from its insurers), or extinguished if the amount
recovered exceeds the amount of the Claim. 
---|--- 
 



   9.2 |

Where the Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is at any time
entitled to recover from some other person (not being the Buyer or any
member of the Buyers 

---|--- 
 



65 Party) any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to a Claim, the Buyer
shall use its reasonable endeavours to enforce such recovery: 
---|--- 



   9.2.1 | If the Buyer recovers any amount from a Third Party, the amount
of the Claim shall then be reduced by the amount recovered (less all costs,
charges and expenses reasonably and properly incurred in recovering that
sum from such Third Party) or be extinguished if the amount recovered exceeds
the amount of the Claim. 
---|--- 



   9.2.2 | If the Warrantors at any time pay to the Buyer an amount
pursuant to a Claim and the Buyer subsequently becomes entitled to recover
from a Third Party any sum in respect of the matter giving rise to such Claim,
the Buyer shall use its reasonable endeavours to enforce such recovery, and
shall repay to the Warrantors as soon as possible so much of the amount paid
to the Warrantors as does not exceed the sum recovered from such Third Party
(less all costs, charges and expenses incurred in recovering that sum from
such Third Party). 
---|--- 



   10. | THIRD PARTY CLAIM 
---|--- 



   10.1 | The provisions of this paragraph 10 shall apply in the event
that any claim is made or threatened by any third party against the Buyer, the
Company or any Subsidiary, which may reasonably be considered likely to
give rise to a Claim (Third Party Claim). 
---|--- 



   10.2 | In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Buyer shall: 
---|--- 



   10.2.1 | as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event with 5
Business Days of the date upon which the Buyer (or any other member of the
Buyers Group) becomes aware of the Third Party Claim give written notice of
the Third Party Claim to any of the Warrantors, specifying in reasonable
detail the nature of the Third Party Claim; and 
---|--- 



   10.2.2 | keep the relevant Warrantor fully informed of the progress of,
and all material developments in relation to, the Third Party Claim and
provide the relevant Warrantor with copies of all material information
and correspondence relating to such claim (such relevant Warrantor being
permitted to share all relevant information with the other Warrantor); 
---|--- 



   10.2.3 | give (and procure that each member of the Buyers Group shall
give) the Warrantors and their professional advisers access at reasonable
times (and on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and personnel, and
to any relevant assets, accounts, documents or records within its control,
for the purposes of enabling the Warrantors and their advisers to assess the
Third Party Claim, and enabling the Warrantors to exercise their rights under
this paragraph 10.2 and paragraph 10.3. 
---|--- 



   10.3 | Subject to the Warrantors indemnifying the Buyer in accordance
with paragraph 10.4, the Buyer shall: 
---|--- 



   10.3.1 | take (and shall procure that each member of the Buyers Group
shall take) such action as the Warrantors may reasonably request in writing to
avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, compromise or defend the Third Party Claim
and to appeal against any judgment given in respect of it; 
---|--- 



   10.3.2 | not (and shall procure that no other member of the Buyers
Group shall) agree any compromise or settlement, or make any admission of
liability or payment in relation to a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Warrantors (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and 
---|--- 



   10.3.3 | if required by the Warrantors in writing, delegate the conduct
of any legal proceedings in respect of the Third Party Claim to the Warrantors
(Proceedings). For this purpose, the Buyer shall retain such firm
of solicitors as is selected by the Warrantors to proceed on behalf of the
Buyer, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary (as the case may be) in relation
to the Proceedings in accordance with the instructions of the Warrantors, and
the Buyer shall give such information and assistance as the Warrantors or the
appointed solicitors may reasonably require in connection with the conduct of
the Proceedings. 
---|--- 
 



66 satisfaction in respect of all costs, charges and expenses that are reasonably
and properly incurred by the Buyer (or any other member of the Buyers Group)
as a consequence of any actions taken at the request of the Warrantors in
accordance with paragraph 10.2 or paragraph 10.3. 
---|--- 



   10.5 | The Warrantors shall have no liability in respect of a Claim or
any indemnity claim to the extent that the liability pursuant to the relevant
Claim or any indemnities or is increased as a result of the failure by
the Buyer (or any other member of the Buyers Group) to act in accordance
with any reasonable request or direction given by the Warrantors in accordance
with paragraph 10.2 
---|--- 
 



   11. | DOUBLE RECOVERY 
---|--- 

Neither the Buyer nor any member of the Buyers Group shall be entitled to
recover damages, or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity
more than once in respect of the same loss arising from any shortfall, damage,
deficiency, breach or other event or circumstances which gives rise to more
than one claim, indemnity claim or claim under the tax covenant in respect of
such loss.
