<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;<B><U>Indemnification by the Selling Members.</B></U> In connection with the registration of the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section, each Selling Member whose Shares are being registered hereby agrees that it will severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Energen, each director, officer, controlling person (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and affiliate of Energen and each other person who acts on Energen's behalf in the offering or sale of such securities (collectively, the <B>"Energen Indemnitees"),</B> against any and all losses, claims, fines, penalties, damages or liabilities, and expenses (including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with such Selling Member's prior consent and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) to which Energen or any Energen Indemnitee may become subject under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, fines, penalties, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (A) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (but only to the extent that such misstatements or omissions referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above were made, done or omitted in any such registration statement, any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to Energen or its representatives in writing specifically for use therein by or at the direction of such Selling Member or any of its representatives). Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Energen or any Energen Indemnitee and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Shares by the Selling Member.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;<B><U>Notices of Claims, Etc.</B></U> Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of any demand or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this subsection (d), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, promptly give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; <U>provided</U> that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subsections of this Section, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying parties similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of any such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof (unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment any meaningful conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defense thereof) and the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its reasonable consent. No indemnifying party will consent to entry of judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. An indemnifying party who elects not to assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim (unless in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified parties additional counsel are necessary to address conflicts of interest between the indemnified parties, in which case the indemnifying party shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of such additional counsel).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv)&#9;<B><U>Contribution.</B></U> If the indemnification provided for in this subsection (d) from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party for any loss, claim, fines, penalties, damage, liability or expense covered thereby, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, fine, penalty, damage, liability or expense. The contribution of such indemnifying party shall be limited to the proportionate share of the amount paid or payable that reflects the relative fault of the indemnifying party with respect to such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense; provided that the maximum amount to be contributed by any Selling Member indemnifying party shall not exceed the net amount of proceeds received by such Selling Member pursuant to the sale of securities in connection with the registration set forth in this Section. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact was made by or relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party and the intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying and indemnified parties agree that it would not be just and equitable to determine contribution under this subsection (d) by pro rata allocation or by any other method which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above.</P></DIR>
