The properties, rights and interests specified in the foregoing subsections

(c) _Assumed Liabilities.

   _

On the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and agree to timely and fully pay,

2. _Purchase Price.

   _

(a) Subject to subsection (b) below, in consideration for the Properties,
Buyer will pay to Seller $120,000,000 in cash and Energen Corporation
("Energen") will issue to Seller an aggregate of 3,043,479 shares of Energen
common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Energen Common Stock"), which is
quoted under the symbol "EGN" on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE").
Such cash and Energen Common Stock, unadjusted by any adjustments provided for
in this Agreement or agreed to by the parties, are herein called the "Base
Purchase Price." The cash portion of the Base Purchase Price may be adjusted
as provided in Sections 6(c) and 8 hereof and the Energen Common Stock portion
of the Base Purchase Price may be adjusted as provided in Section 2(b) hereof
(the Base Purchase Price, as so adjusted, and as the same may otherwise be
adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties, being herein called the "Purchase
Price"). The Purchase Price shall be delivered at the Closing as hereinafter
provided.

 

(b) (i) In the event that the average closing sale price of the Energen Common
Stock as reported by the NYSE for the twenty days of trading ending on the
third business day prior to the Closing (the "Average Closing Share Price") is
less than $18.40 per share, in lieu of the number of shares of Energen Common
Stock provided in subsection (a) above, Buyer will issue to Seller an
aggregate number of shares of Energen Common Stock equal to $56,000,000
divided by the Average Closing Share Price.

   

(ii) In the event that the Average Closing Share Price is more than $27.60 per
share, in lieu of the number of shares of Energen Common Stock provided in
subsection (a) above, Buyer will issue to Seller an aggregate number of shares
of Energen Common Stock equal to $84,000,000 divided by the Average Closing
Share Price.

 

(iii) The share prices set forth in subsections (b) (i) and (b) (ii) above
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any stock dividends, stock
combinations, stock splits, or reverse stock splits with respect to Energen
Common Stock.

   

(c) Energen will not issue any certificates for any fractional shares of
Energen Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the transaction
contemplated hereby. In lieu of issuing such fractional shares, Buyer shall
pay cash to Seller in respect of such fractional share. Such cash payment
shall be based on the Average Closing Share Price.

 

(d) The shares of Energen Common Stock issued to the Seller pursuant to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement are referred to herein as the
"Shares."

 

(e) Energen will promptly use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to
the Closing, the Shares on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

(f) The purchase price for federal income tax purposes shall be allocated
among the Assets in the manner required by Section 1060 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). The parties shall agree on such an
allocation within 30 days of the Closing Date; provided, however, the parties
hereby agree that, for federal income tax purposes, the value of the Energen
Common Stock shall be the average of the highest and lowest prices of such
stock on the day of Closing. It is agreed that substantially all of the
Properties shall be classified as class 5 (equipment and real property) assets
for purposes of Form 8594. The parties shall use such allocation for purposes
of any required tax returns or other filings made with the Internal Revenue
Service pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code.

   

3. _Deposit._ On or before March 7, 2002, Buyer shall pay to Seller $7,500,000 (such amount being herein called the "Deposit"). In the event the transaction contemplated hereby is consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, the Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at the Closing. In the event the transaction contemplated hereby fails to close on the Closing Date, as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by Seller (regardless of whether this Agreement has been breached by Buyer), or in the event this Agreement is terminated by Buyer in accordance with Section 9 below or is terminated by Seller in accordance with any subsection of Section 10 below other than subsections 10(a) and 10(b), the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer. In the event that the transaction contemplated hereby does not close for any other reason, the Deposit shall be retained by Seller as its sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement. The Deposit shall not bear interest, and if the same is paid to Buyer, or if Buyer receives credit for same against the Purchase Price paid at Closing, such payment, or credit, shall be in the amount of the Deposit and shall not include any additional amounts. THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.

knowledge (which, as used in this Agreement, shall mean to the actual
knowledge of any of Seller\'s officers) and except as set forth in Exhibit
4(a)(iii), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the compliance with

reports related thereto, and no judicial, administrative or arbitral
proceeding is pending or, to the best of Seller\'s knowledge, threatened

list of all existing material contracts with respect to the Properties
(collectively the "Material Contracts"). To Seller\'s knowledge, all the
Material Contracts are valid and effective. Seller has not received written

governmental authority.

 

(xviii) _Condition of Properties._ To the best of Seller\'s knowledge, all
wells, fixtures, facilities, personal property and equipment that are material
to the operation of the Wells operated by Seller have been and are currently
being maintained in a state of repair so as to be adequate for normal
operations as currently operated. To the best of Seller\'s knowledge, all
wells, fixtures, facilities, personal property and equipment that are material
to the operation of Wells that are not operated by Seller have been and are
currently being maintained in a state of repair so as to be adequate for
normal operations as currently operated.

 

(xix) _Securities Representations.

 _

(1) Except for any distribution of the Shares to its members and any Member\'s
sale pursuant to registration under Section 18, the Seller will hold the
Shares for its own account for investment purposes only, and not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of all or any part
thereof, except in compliance with applicable federal or state securities
laws.

 

(2) Seller understands that (A) the Shares (1) have not been registered under
the Securities Act or any state securities laws, (2) will be issued in
reliance upon exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws for an offer and sale of securities not
involving a public offering, and(3) may not be sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of without satisfaction of certain conditions, including registration
under, or the availability of any exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and (B) Seller must
therefore bear the economic risk of such investment indefinitely unless a
subsequent disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or is exempt therefrom. Seller further
understands that such exemptions depend upon, among other things, the nature
of the investment intent of Seller expressed herein.

 

(3) Seller has been furnished by Buyer and Energen all information (or
provided access to all information) regarding the business and financial
condition of Energen, the attributes of the Shares and the merits and risks of
an investment in the Shares which Seller has requested to evaluate an
investment in the Shares. Specifically, Seller acknowledges that Seller has
had an opportunity to review Energen\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended September 30, 2001 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended December 31, 2001 and the other SEC Documents (as defined in
Section 5(i)).

 

(4) Seller is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Act, and Seller, or those persons retained by Seller,
have knowledge, skill and experience in financial, business and investment
matters relating to an investment of the same nature as the Shares and are
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment and protecting
Seller in connection with the purchase and an investment in the Shares. Seller
has, to the extent deemed necessary, retained, at its own expense, and relied
upon, appropriate professional advice regarding the investment, tax and legal
merits and consequences of an investment in the Shares. Seller has examined
the SEC Documents, or caused the same to be examined, by its representatives
to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate. Seller has not received any
legal, business, tax or other advice from Energen, its counsel or other
representatives.

 

(5) No person or entity, other than Energen, has been authorized to give any
information or to make any representations on behalf of Energen in connection
with the purchase, and if given or made, such information or representations
have not been relied upon by Seller as having been made or authorized by
Energen. The only representations, warranties and information made by Energen
in connection with the purchase are those contained in this Agreement and the
SEC Documents.

 

(6) Energen has provided Seller the opportunity to ask questions of, and
receive answers from, Energen and Buyer and their respective officers and
directors concerning the purchase and the Shares and to obtain any appropriate
additional information necessary to the investment decision being made by
Seller in connection with the Purchase and the Shares.

   

(b) _Disclaimers._ THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER
CONTAINED IN SECTION 4 AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY IN THE CONVEYANCE ARE
EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY

CONTAINED IN SECTION 4 AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY IN THE CONVEYANCE, THE
PROPERTIES SHALL BE CONVEYED PURSUANT HERETO WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR
REPRESENTATION WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO
TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES OR RELATING TO THE CONDITION, QUANTITY, QUALITY,

MATERIALS OR MERCHANTABILITY OF ANY EQUIPMENT OR ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE,
AND, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH,
WITHOUT ANY OTHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER WARRANTY OR

BUYER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ANY CLAIMS AGAINST SELLER WITH RESPECT TO
THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AS TO THEIR

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE
OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, SOLID WASTES, ASBESTOS AND OTHER MAN MADE
FIBERS, OR NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS (NORM). EXCEPT FOR THE
EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN SECTION 4, BUYER IS
RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTIES, AND EXCEPT FOR ANY
BREACHES BY SELLER OF THE REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CONTAINED IN SECTION
4(a)(xviii), BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN THEIR AS IS, WHERE IS

ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA, REPORTS, RECORDS, PROJECTIONS,
INFORMATION OR MATERIALS NOW, HERETOFORE OR HEREAFTER FURNISHED OR MADE
AVAILABLE TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, RELATIVE TO PRICING ASSUMPTIONS, OR QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF
HYDROCARBON RESERVES (IF ANY) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROPERTIES OR THE ABILITY OR
POTENTIAL OF THE PROPERTIES TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY OTHER MATTERS CONTAINED IN ANY MATERIALS
FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER BY SELLER OR BY SELLER\'S AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES. ANY AND ALL SUCH DATA, RECORDS, REPORTS, PROJECTIONS,
INFORMATION AND OTHER MATERIALS (WRITTEN OR ORAL) FURNISHED BY SELLER OR
OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE OR DISCLOSED TO BUYER ARE PROVIDED BUYER AS A
CONVENIENCE AND SHALL NOT CREATE OR GIVE RISE TO ANY LIABILITY OF OR AGAINST
SELLER AND ANY RELIANCE ON OR USE OF THE SAME SHALL BE AT BUYER\'S SOLE RISK
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

   

5. _Representations of Buyer._ Buyer represents to Seller that:

   

(a) _Organization and Qualification._ Buyer is a corporation duly organized
and legally existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Alabama, and is qualified to do business and in good standing in each of the
states in which Oil and Gas Properties are located where the laws of such
state would require a corporation owning or operating the Oil and Gas
Properties located in such state to so qualify. Buyer is also qualified to own
and operate oil and gas properties with all applicable governmental agencies
having jurisdiction over the Properties, to the extent such qualification is
necessary or appropriate or will be necessary or appropriate upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, Buyer
has met, or will have met at or before Closing, all bonding requirements of
such agencies).

 

(b) _Due Authorization._ Buyer has the full power to enter into and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and shall have taken all proper action to
authorize entering into this Agreement and performance of its obligations
hereunder.

 

(c) _Approvals._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the compliance with
the terms hereof, will result in any default under any agreement or instrument
to which Buyer is a party, or violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Buyer.

 

(d) _Valid, Binding and Enforceable._ This Agreement constitutes (and the
Conveyance provided for herein to be delivered at Closing will, when executed
and delivered, constitute) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy or
other laws applicable generally to creditor\'s rights and as limited by
general equitable principles.

 

(e) _No Litigation._ There are no pending suits, actions, or other proceedings
in which Buyer is a party (or, to Buyer\'s knowledge, which have been
threatened to be instituted against Buyer) which affect the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(f) _Knowledgeable Buyer, No Distribution._ Buyer is a knowledgeable
purchaser, owner and operator of oil and gas properties, has the ability to
evaluate (and in fact has evaluated) the Properties for purchase, and is
acquiring the Properties for its own account and not with the intent to make a
distribution in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (and the
rules and regulations pertaining thereto) or in violation of any other
applicable securities laws, rules or regulations.

 

(g) _Funds._ Buyer has, and at the Closing will have, such funds as are
necessary for the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(h) _Validity of Energen Common Stock._ The shares of Energen Common Stock to
be issued in exchange for the Properties, when issued in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and will not be subject to preemptive or similar rights. The
Shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, pledges, options, mortgages,
security interests, claims, restrictions (whether on voting, sale, transfer,
disposition, or otherwise), and other encumbrances of every type and
description, whether imposed by law, agreement, understanding, or otherwise,
except restrictions on transfer that may be imposed by federal or state
securities laws or the Stockholders\' Agreement to be entered into pursuant
hereto.

 

(i) _Financial Reports and SEC Documents; Material Adverse Effect._ Energen\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, and
all other reports, registration statements, definitive proxy statements or
information statements filed by it subsequent to September 30, 2001, under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or under Section
13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act") in the form filed (collectively, the "SEC Documents")
with the SEC, as of the date filed, (A) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and (B) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and each of the consolidated balance
sheets contained in or incorporated by reference into any such SEC Document
(including the related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presented the
financial position of Energen and its consolidated subsidiaries as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of income, shareholders\' equity
and cash flows in such SEC Documents (including any related notes and
schedules thereto) fairly presented in all material respects the results of
operations, shareholders\' equity and cash flows, as the case may be, of
Energen and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods to which they
relate, in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each
case as may be noted therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and
the absence of footnotes in the case of interim unaudited statements.

 

(j) _No Material Change._ Except as described in the SEC Documents, since
September 30, 2001, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events,
is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect with respect to
Energen and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

   

6. _Certain Covenants of Seller Pending Closing._ Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date:

  _

 _

(a) _Access by Buyer.

     _

(i) _Records._ Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement between the parties (a
copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 6(a)), Seller will give Buyer, or
Buyer\'s authorized representatives, at Seller\'s office and at all reasonable
times before the Closing Date, access to the Records, for the purpose of
conducting due diligence reviews contemplated by Section 7 below. Buyer may
make copies of such records, at its expense, but shall, if Seller so requests,
return all copies so made if the Closing does not occur; all costs of copying
such items shall be borne by Buyer. BUYER RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT ALL
MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE TO IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, WHETHER MADE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION OR OTHERWISE, ARE MADE
AVAILABLE TO IT AS AN ACCOMMODATION, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AS TO THE ACCURACY AND
COMPLETENESS OF SUCH MATERIALS. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS
MADE BY SELLER AS TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO BUYER AND EXCEPT FOR THE
EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN SECTION 4, WITH RESPECT TO
THE PROPERTIES TO WHICH THE INFORMATION RELATES, AND BUYER EXPRESSLY AGREES
THAT ANY CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM SUCH INFORMATION SHALL BE THE RESULT OF ITS
OWN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND JUDGMENT.

 

(ii) _Physical Inspection._ Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement between
the parties (described above), Seller shall make a good faith effort to give
Buyer, or Buyer\'s authorized representatives, at all reasonable times before
the Closing Date and upon adequate notice to Seller, physical access to the
Oil and Gas Properties for the purpose of inspecting same. Buyer recognizes
that some or all of the Properties may be operated by parties other than
Seller and that Seller\'s ability to obtain access to such properties, and the
manner and extent of such access, is subject to such third parties. Buyer
agrees to comply fully with the rules, regulations and instructions issued by
Seller (and, where Properties are operated by other parties, such other
parties) regarding the actions of Buyer while upon, entering or leaving the
Properties. Buyer agrees to furnish Seller with any report (at no cost to
Seller), it receives or prepares, related to Buyer\'s environmental inspection
of the Properties. Buyer will send Seller a copy of such report within 2 days
before Closing at the address set forth in Section 16.

 

(iii) _Indemnification and Limitation on Liability._ If Buyer exercises rights
of access under this Section or otherwise, or conducts examinations or
inspections under this Section or otherwise, then (a) such access, examination
and inspection shall be at Buyer\'s sole risk, cost and expense and Buyer
waives and releases all claims against Seller (and its partners and its and
their affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys,
contractors and agents of such parties) arising in any way therefrom or in any
way connected therewith or arising in connection with the conduct of its
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents in
connection therewith and (b) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller (and its partners and its and their affiliates and the respective
officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such
parties) from any and all claims, actions, causes of action liabilities,
damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs
and attorneys fees), or liens or encumbrances for labor or materials, arising
out of or in any way connected with such matters. THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND
INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF
ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SINGLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS
NEGLIGENCE) OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR (ii) STRICT LIABILITY.

   

(b) _Interim Operation._ Seller will continue the operation of the Properties
in the ordinary course of its business (or, where Seller is not the operator
of a Property, will continue its actions as a non-operator in the ordinary
course of its business), and will not sell or otherwise dispose of any portion
of the Properties, except for sales or other dispositions of (i) oil, gas and
other minerals in the ordinary course of business after production, or (ii)
equipment and other personal property or fixtures in the ordinary course of
business where the same has become obsolete, is otherwise no longer useful for
the operation of the Properties, or is replaced by an item or items of at
least equal suitability. Should Seller receive (or desire to make) any
proposals to drill additional wells on the Oil and Gas Properties, or to
conduct other operations which require consent of non-operators under the
applicable operating agreement, it will notify Buyer of, and consult with
Buyer concerning, such proposals, and will not consent to any single operation
exceeding $50,000 in cost (net to Seller\'s interest) without the consent of
Buyer, which such consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If such proposed
operation does not exceed $50,000 (net to Seller\'s interest) any decisions
with respect to such proposal shall be made by Seller in its sole discretion,
so long as the decisions are made in the ordinary course of business. Without
expanding any obligations which Seller may have to Buyer, it is expressly
agreed that Seller shall never have any liability to Buyer with respect to
operation of a Property greater than that which it might have as the operator
to a non-operator under the applicable operating agreement (or, in the absence
of such an agreement, under the AAPL 610 (1989 Revision) form Operating
Agreement), IT BEING RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH FORM, THE
OPERATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY
OTHER THAN FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 

(c) _Preferential Rights and Consents._ Seller and Buyer will use reasonable
efforts consistent with industry practice in transactions of this type, with
respect to all Oil and Gas Properties, to develop a list of the names and
addresses of parties holding Preferential Rights and Consents. Seller will
request, from the parties so identified (and in accordance with the documents
creating such rights), execution of Consents and/or waivers of Preferential
Rights. Seller shall have no obligation other than to request such execution
of Consents and/or waivers of Preferential Rights (including, without
limitation, Seller shall have no obligation to assure that such Consents or
waivers of Preferential Rights are obtained). If, prior to Closing, Seller
fails to obtain requisite Consents and/or waivers of Preferential Rights or
the time periods for the giving of a Consent or the exercise of a Preferential
Right have not expired, Buyer may at its sole option prior to Closing (i)
waive the defect or (ii) exclude the property affected, or in the case where
only a portion of the property is affected, exclude the affected portion, from
the Oil and Gas Properties and deduct the Pref Right Value (as defined below)
therefore from the Base Purchase Price. If a party from whom a waiver of a
Preferential Right is requested refuses to give such waiver prior to Closing,
Seller will tender to such party the required interest in the Property (the
value of which shall be deemed to be equal to the amount specified in Schedule
I hereto for such Property, reduced appropriately, as determined by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller, if less than the entire Property must be
tendered) (the "Pref Right Value"), and to the extent that such Preferential
Right is exercised by such party, and such interest in such Property is
actually sold to such party so exercising such right, such interest in such
Property will be excluded from the transaction contemplated hereby and the
cash portion of the Base Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the Pref
Right Value. With respect to any properties that have been excluded from the
Oil and Gas Properties prior to Closing because of the existence of a
Preferential Right that has not been exercised or waived, if, within ninety
(90) days after Closing, such Preferential Right is waived or the time period
for the exercise thereof has passed without the Preferential Right being
exercised, then Seller shall convey such property to Buyer and Buyer shall pay
in cash the Pref Right Value therefor. If after the Closing, any party holding
a Preferential Right on a Property elects to exercise same and Buyer has paid
for and accepted conveyance of the Property, Buyer shall comply with the terms
of the applicable Preferential Right. Buyer shall be due any consideration
paid by such third party upon the exercise of such Preferential Right in
exchange for Buyer delivering such third party an assignment for that portion
of the Property affected by the exercise of such Preferential Right, and
Seller shall pay to Buyer, the amount, if any, which the Pref Right Value for
such Property exceeds the amount received by Buyer from such third party for
such Property. Buyer shall indemnify Seller for any failure to comply with the
terms of the Preferential Right as provided in the preceding sentence, up to
an amount not to exceed the Pref Right Value for the affected Property.

   

7. _Due Diligence Reviews.

 

   _

(a) _Review By Buyer._ Buyer may conduct, at its sole cost, such title
examination or investigation, and other examinations and investigations, as it
may in its sole discretion choose to conduct with respect to the Properties in
order to determine whether Defects (as below defined) exist. Should, as a
result of such examinations and investigations, or otherwise, one or more
matters come to Buyer\'s attention which would constitute a Defect (as below
defined), and should there be one or more of such Defects which Buyer is
unwilling to waive and close the transaction contemplated hereby
notwithstanding the fact that such Defects exist, Buyer shall notify Seller in
writing of such Defects as soon as the same are identified by Buyer, but in no
event later than three (3) business days before Closing (such Defects of which
Buyer so provides notice are herein called "Asserted Defects"). Such
notification shall include, for each Asserted Defect, (i) a description of the
Asserted Defect and the wells and/or units and/or PDNP or PUD (both as defined
below) locations listed on Schedule I to which it relates and all supporting
documentation reasonably necessary to fully describe the basis for the Defect,
(ii) for each applicable well or unit or PUD location, the size of any
variance from Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest which does or could
result from such Asserted Defect and (iii) the amount by which Buyer would
propose to adjust the Purchase Price. All Defects with respect to which Buyer
fails to so give Seller notice will be deemed waived for all purposes;
provided, however, such waiver shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any breach of the title warranties set forth in the Conveyance. All access to
Seller\'s records and the Properties in connection with such due diligence
shall be subject and pursuant to Section 6(a) (including, without limitation,
the exculpation and indemnification provisions contained in Section
6(a)(iii)). For this Agreement, "PDNP" shall mean one or more properties or
portions of properties to which Proved Reserves are categorized as Proved
Developed Non-Producing in the Definitions for Oil and Gas Reserves
promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers as in effect at Closing. For
this Agreement, "PUD" shall mean one or more properties or portions of
properties to which Proved Reserves are categorized as Undeveloped in the
Definitions for Oil and Gas Reserves promulgated by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers as in effect at Closing.

 

(b) _Nature of Defects._ The term "Defect" as used in this Section shall mean
the following:

   

(i) _NRI or WI Variances._ Seller\'s ownership of the Properties is such that,
with respect to a well, or unit, or PDNP or PUD location listed on Schedule I
hereto, it (A) entitles Seller to receive a decimal share of the oil, gas and
other hydrocarbons produced from such unit, or from currently producing
completions in such well, or from any PDNP or PUD location which is less than
the decimal share set forth on Schedule I in connection with such well or unit
in the column headed Net Revenue Interest or (B) causes Seller to be obligated
to bear a decimal share of the cost of operation of such well (as to such
completions), or unit, or PDNP or PUD location greater than the decimal share
set forth on Schedule I in connection with such well, or unit, or PDNP or PUD
location in the column headed Working Interest (without at least a
proportionate increase in the share of production to which Seller is entitled
to receive from such well, or unit, or PDNP or PUD location).

 

(ii) _Liens._ Seller\'s ownership of an Oil and Gas Property is subject to a
lien other than (A) a lien for taxes which are not yet delinquent or (B) a
mechanic\'s or materialmen\'s lien (or other similar lien), or a lien under an
operating agreement or similar agreement, to the extent the same relates to
expenses incurred which are not yet delinquent or (C) liens which will be
released at or before Closing.

 

(iii) _Preferential Rights and Consents._ Seller\'s ownership of an Oil and
Gas Property is subject to a Preferential Right or a requirement that Consent
be obtained, unless such Consent or a waiver of such Preferential Right has
been obtained with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby or, in the
case of a Preferential Right, an appropriate tender of the applicable interest
has been made to all parties holding such right and, with respect to each such
party, either (A) the period of time required for such party to exercise such
right has expired without such party exercising such right, (B) such right has
been exercised and the affected portion of the Properties has been excluded
from the transactions contemplated hereby (and the cash portion of the Base
Purchase Price adjusted downward) as provided in Section 6(c), or (C) the
period of time required for such party to exercise such right has not expired
(in which case Section 6(c) shall control).

 

(iv) _Overproduced Positions._ With respect to any well or unit listed on
Schedule I, Seller and its predecessors in title to the Properties have
collectively taken more gas or oil from such well or unit than the ownership
of the Properties would entitle them to receive (an overproduced position),
except for overproduced positions for wells or units disclosed on Exhibit
7(b)(iv) as being in an overproduced position, where the overproduced position
actually determined to exist is not greater than 100% of that disclosed on the
exhibit.

 

(v) _Environmental Matters._ Except as disclosed on Exhibit 7(b)(v), an Oil
and Gas Property is in violation of Environmental Laws (below defined) in any
material respect (Environmental Laws shall mean all applicable federal, state
or local laws, rules, orders or regulations pertaining to health or the
environment, including those relating to waste materials and/or hazardous
substances).

 

(vi) _Other Matters._ Any other liens, charges, encumbrances, agreements,
obligations, irregularities or circumstances affecting the Properties that
individually or in the aggregate materially reduce the revenues from the Oil
and Gas Properties or materially increase the costs of the operation of the
Oil and Gas Properties.

   

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be asserted as, a
Defect: (i) defects or irregularities arising out of lack of corporate
authorization or a variation in corporate name, unless Buyer provides
affirmative evidence that such corporate action was not authorized and results
in another person\'s superior claim of title to the relevant Property; (ii)
defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied by the passage of
time, including, without limitation, applicable statutes of limitation or
statutes for prescription; (iii) defects or irregularities in the chain of
title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents or
omissions of heirship proceedings; (iv) defects or irregularities in title
which for a period of 5 years or more has not delayed or prevented Seller (or
Seller\'s predecessor, if owned by Seller less than 5 years) from receiving
its Net Revenue Interest share of the proceeds of production or causes it to
bear a share of expenses and costs greater than its Working Interest share
from any unit or well; (v) defects or irregularities resulting from or related
to probate proceedings or the lack thereof which defects or irregularities
have been outstanding for 5 years or more; and (vi) conventional rights of
reassignment normally actuated by an intent to abandon or release a lease and
requiring notice to the holders of such rights and any defect or irregularity
as would normally be waived by persons engaged in the oil and gas business
when purchasing producing properties.

 

(c) _Seller\'s Response._ In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of Asserted
Defects, Seller may (but shall have no obligation to) (i) attempt to cure,
prior to Closing or within 90 days after Closing (the "Defect Cure Deadline"),
one or more Asserted Defects, or (ii) Seller may elect to have one or more
Asserted Defects handled under Section 8 below (it being expressly recognized
that Seller may attempt to cure Asserted Defects while acting under this
election).

   

8. _Certain Price Adjustments.

 

   _

(a) _Procedures._ In the event that, as a part of the due diligence reviews
provided for in Section 7 above, Asserted Defects are presented to Seller and
Seller is unable (or unwilling) to cure such Asserted Defects by Closing, or
in the event that Buyer or Seller has elected (pursuant to Section 15) to
treat an Oil and Gas Property affected by a casualty loss as if it was an Oil
and Gas Property affected by an Asserted Defect, then:

   

(i) _Agree Upon Adjustment._ Buyer and Seller shall, with respect to each
Property affected by such matters for which Seller is unable (or unwilling) to
cure before Closing, attempt to agree upon an appropriate downward adjustment
of the Purchase Price to account for such matters; and

 

(ii) _Exclude Property._ With respect to each Property as to which Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree upon an appropriate adjustment with respect to all
such matters affecting such Property or each Property as to which the Asserted
Defect amount exceeds an amount properly allocable to such Property based upon
the allocated values set forth on Schedule I, or for any other reason set
forth by Seller, such Property may be excluded at the option of either Buyer
or Seller, from the transaction contemplated hereby, and the Purchase Price
will be reduced by an amount properly allocable to such Property based upon
the allocated values set forth on Schedule I for the wells and PDNP or PUD
locations located on such Property plus the amount attributed on Schedule I to
the units in which such Property participates (but in the case of such units,
limited to the portion of such amount which is proportionate to the portion of
Seller\'s interest in such units, respectively, which is attributable to such
Property) (the "Allocated Property Value"); provided, however, if Seller is
able to cure such Asserted Defects prior to the Defect Cure Deadline, then
Seller shall convey the affected Property to Buyer and Buyer shall pay to
Seller the Allocated Property Value for such Property.

   

(b) _Certain Adjustments._ In the event that Buyer raises as an Asserted
Defect one of the following types of Defects, the cash portion of the Base
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set forth below in connection with such
Defect (and such adjustment shall be deemed an adjustment agreed to under
Section 8(a)(i)):

   

(i) _NRI Variance/Proportionate Price Reductions._ If the Asserted Defect is
(I) a Defect described in clause (A) of Section 7(b)(i) or (II) a Defect which
otherwise affects a portion of Seller\'s net revenue interest in a well, or
unit, or PDNP or PUD location listed on Schedule I: a downward adjustment
equal to the amount determined by multiplying the Allocated Property Value for
such Property by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is an amount equal to
the "Net Revenue Interest" shown on Schedule I for such Property less the
decimal share to which Seller is entitled to as a result of its ownership
interest in such Property which is unaffected by such Defect and (B) the
denominator of which is the "Net Revenue Interest" shown for such Property on
Schedule I; provided, however, if the Working Interest set forth on Schedule I
for such Property is not reduced in the same proportion that the Net Revenue
set forth on Schedule I for such Property is reduced because of such Defect
then such Defect shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 8(a).

 

(ii) _Liens/Payoff Amount._ If the Asserted Defect is a Defect described in
Section 7(b)(ii): a downward adjustment equal to the amount of the debt
secured by such lien.

 

(iii) _Overproduced Position/Per Mcf Amount._ If the Asserted Defect is a
Defect described in Section 7(b)(iv) for gas: a downward adjustment in an
amount equal to $1.50/Mcf multiplied by the overproduced position which is
actually determined to exist or, in the case of a well or unit for where an
overproduced position is disclosed on Exhibit 7(b)(iv), $1.50/Mcf multiplied
by the amount by which the overproduced position which is actually determined
to exist exceeds 100% of the overproduced position shown on such exhibit.

 

(iv) _N. Robertson Unit._ Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, with respect to the overproduced position described on Exhibit
7(b)(iv) for oil under the heading N. Robertson Unit (NRU) Oil Pipeline
Imbalance (the "NRU Oil Imbalance"), Seller agrees that prior to Closing it
will offer one or more of the underproduced parties with claims to the NRU Oil
Imbalance a cash settlement of $333,190, which is based upon 17,642.69 barrels
and an average price of $18.89 per barrel received during the period of
overdelivery to Seller\'s predecessor. If settlement of the NRU Oil Imbalance
does not occur before Closing, the Purchase Price will be reduced by $333,190.
To the extent a partial settlement of the NRU Oil Imbalance occurs before
Closing, the Purchase Price will be reduced by $18.89 times the barrels by
which the overproduced position is actually reduced by any such settlements.

 

(v) _Overproduced Position/Per BBL Amount._ If the Asserted Defect is a Defect
described in Section 7(b)(iv) for oil: a downward adjustment in an amount
equal to the average price per barrel based upon actual price history for the
time period affected multiplied by the overproduced position which is actually
determined to exist or, in the case of a well or unit for where an
overproduced position is disclosed on Exhibit 7(b)(iv), the average price per
barrel based upon actual price history for the time period affected multiplied
by the amount by which the overproduced position which is actually determined
to exist exceeds 100% of the overproduced position described in Section
8(a)(iv) or shown on such exhibit.

   

(c) _Possible Upward Adjustments._ Should Seller determine (or should Buyer,
in the course of its due diligence reviews contemplated by Section 7 above,
determine) that (i) the ownership of the Properties by Seller entitles Seller
to a decimal share of the production from a well, or unit, or PDNP or PUD
location listed on Schedule I greater than the decimal share shown for such
well, or unit, or PDNP or PUD location under the column headed Net Revenue
Interest on such Schedule I, or (ii) with respect to any well or unit listed
on Schedule I, Seller and its predecessors in title have collectively taken
less gas from such well or unit than the ownership of such well or unit would
entitle them to take (underproduced position) or with respect to any well or
unit for which an overproduced position (e.g. a situation where Seller and its
predecessors in title have collectively taken more gas from such well or unit
than the ownership of such well or unit would entitle them to receive) is
disclosed on Exhibit 7(b)(iv) an overproduced position exists that is less
than 100% of that so disclosed on the exhibit, then Seller may propose an
upward adjustment to the Purchase Price to account for such fact, in which
case such adjustment shall be handled in the same manner as provided in (A)
Section 8(b)(iii) above with respect to underproduced positions and (B)
Section 8(a) above with respect to all other such matters. The party making
such determination shall notify the other party no later than three (3) days
before Closing.

 

(d) _Limitations on Adjustments._ If the Purchase Price reduction with respect
to a particular Asserted Defect (other than Asserted Defects pursuant to
Section 7(b)(iii) or (iv)) which would result from the above provided for
procedure does not exceed $15,000, no adjustment shall be made for such
Asserted Defect. If the Purchase Price reduction which would result from the
above provided for procedure, as applied to all Asserted Defects asserted
under Section 7(b)(i), (ii), (v) or (vi) for which an adjustment is to be made
does not exceed 1% of the Base Purchase Price, then no adjustment of the
Purchase Price shall occur, and none of the Properties which would be excluded
by such procedure shall be excluded. If the Purchase Price reduction which
would result from the above provided for procedure, as applied to all Asserted
Defects asserted under Sections 7(b)(i), (ii), (v) and (vi) for which an
adjustment is to be made exceeds 1% of the Base Purchase Price, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted by the amount by which such reduction exceeds 1% of
the Base Purchase Price.

further obligations to one another hereunder (other than the obligations under
Sections 3, 6(a)(iii), 14, 20(c), 20(e) and 20(g) hereof all of which will
survive such termination). If Buyer proceeds to Closing with knowledge of any

will be deemed waived by Buyer as a condition to Close and Buyer hereby waives
all claims for a breach of representation and warranty related thereto.

11. _Closing.

   _

(a) _Actions At Closing._ The closing (herein called the Closing) of the
transaction contemplated hereby shall take place in the offices of Seller at
the address set forth in Section 16 on or before April 8, 2002, or at such
other date and time as the Buyer and Seller may mutually agree upon (such date

the Purchase Price to the Selling Members.

 

(v) _Succession by Buyer._ Buyer shall (A) furnish to Seller evidence

$100,000.00 per month for the months of January through March, 2002, (ii)
Buyer will bear all overhead charges actually charged by third parties, (iii)
Buyer will receive all proceeds (net of applicable production, severance, and
similar taxes) from sales of oil, gas and/or other minerals which are produced
from (or attributable to) the Properties and which are produced after the
Effective Date and all other proceeds or revenues allocable or attributable to
the Properties from and after the Effective Date including the third party
share of operated overheads, (iv) except as provided in clauses (C) and (D)
below, Section 12(d) below, and Section 13 below Seller will bear all expenses
which are incurred in the operation of the Properties before the Effective

severance, and similar taxes) from the sale of oil, gas and/or other minerals
which were produced from (or attributable to) the Properties and which were
produced before the Effective Date, (v) Buyer will bear any single capital
expenditure not exceeding $25,000 net to the Seller\'s interest incurred on or
after the Effective Date; before the Closing Date, Buyer will bear capital
expenditures exceeding $25,000 net to the Seller\'s interest incurred prior to
the Closing Date only if (i) those capital expenditures are set forth on the
AFEs listed on Exhibit 12(a)(iii) whether paid by Buyer or Seller before or
after the Effective Date, (ii) such expenditures are incurred by Buyer in
accordance with Section 6(b), or (iii) in connection with a third party
operated property, Seller is required to incur such expenditures as a result
of the approval of such expenditures by working interest owners in such
property other than Seller in accordance with the terms of the applicable
operating agreement governing such property, and (vi) Buyer will bear all
lease bonuses set forth on Exhibit 12(a)(iv) whether paid before or after the
Effective Date. It is agreed that, in making such adjustments: (A) oil which
was produced from the Oil and Gas Properties and which was, on the Effective
Date, stored in tanks located on the Oil and Gas Properties (or located
elsewhere but used by Seller to store oil produced from, or attributable to,
the Oil and Gas Properties prior to delivery to oil purchasers) and above
pipeline connections shall be deemed to have been produced before the
Effective Date, (B) ad valorem and similar taxes assessed for periods prior to
the Effective Date shall be borne by Seller and ad valorem taxes assessed for
periods on or after the Effective Date shall be borne by Buyer, (C) ad valorem
and similar taxes assessed with respect to a period which the Effective Date
splits shall be prorated based on the number of days in such period which fall
on each side of the Effective Date (with the day on which the Effective Date
falls being counted in the period after the Effective Date), (D) the
provisions of Section 20(b) shall be given effect as if the same had taken
effect on the Effective Date, (E) casualty losses shall be handled in
accordance with Section 15 and (F) no consideration shall be given to the
local, state or federal income tax liabilities of any party.

 

(b) _Initial Adjustment at Closing._ At least 5 days before the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a statement showing its computations of the
amount of the adjustments provided for in subsection (a) above based on
amounts which prior to such time have actually been paid or received by
Seller. Buyer and Seller shall attempt to agree upon such adjustments prior to
Closing, provided that if agreement is not reached, Seller\'s computation
shall be used at Closing, subject to further adjustment under subsection (c)
below. If the amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a
credit to Buyer exceed the amount of adjustments so determined which would
result in a credit to Seller, Buyer shall, as provided in Section 11 above,
receive a credit at Closing for the amount of such excess, and if the converse
is true, then, as provided in Section 11 above, the amount to be paid by Buyer
to Seller at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

 

(c) _Adjustment Post Closing._ On or before 120 days after Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall review any additional information which may then be available
pertaining to the adjustments provided for in subsection (a) above, shall
determine if any additional adjustments should be made beyond those made at
Closing (whether the same be made to account for expenses or revenues not
considered in making the adjustments made at Closing, or to correct errors
made in the adjustments made at Closing), and shall make any such adjustments
by appropriate payments from Seller to Buyer or from Buyer to Seller within 10
days after such determination. Seller is responsible for preparing the post-
closing statement regarding the adjustments under this subsection. During the
period between Closing and the point in time when such post closing adjustment
has been agreed to, Buyer shall, on a monthly basis, pay over to Seller any
revenue received by it with respect to the Properties which was, under
subsection (a) above, to be reserved by Seller net of any expenses paid by
Buyer which, under such subsection, were to be borne by Seller; such payments
shall be considered in making such post closing adjustment.

 

(d) _No Further Adjustments._ Following the adjustments under subsection (c)
above, no further adjustments shall be made under this Section 12. Should any
revenues or expenses with regard to the Properties be charged to (or received
by) Seller or Buyer after the earlier of (i) the conclusion of such
adjustments under subsection (c) or (ii) 120 days after Closing, the same
shall be borne by (or, in the case of revenues, received by) Buyer, regardless
of the periods to which the same relate, and any bills (or payments) received
by Seller will be forwarded to Buyer except for any revenues related to claims
identified by Seller before the end of such 120 day period (and of which
Seller notifies Buyer before the end of such 120 day period), which revenues
shall belong to Seller.

   

13. _Assumption and Indemnification.

   _

(a) Buyer shall, on the date of Closing, agree (and, upon the delivery to
Buyer of the Conveyance, shall be deemed to have agreed) (i) to assume, and to

Closing. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13(b), it is specifically

out or otherwise relating to the ownership and/or operation of the Properties
after the Effective Date shall be deemed to include all matters arising out of
the condition of the Properties on the Effective Date (including, without
limitation, within such matters all obligations to properly plug and abandon,

surface of the Properties and to comply with, or to bring the Properties into
compliance with, Environmental Laws, rules, regulations and orders, including
conducting any remediation activities which may be required on or otherwise in
connection with activities on the Properties), regardless of whether such
condition or the events giving rise to such condition arose or occurred before
or after the Effective Date, and the assumptions and indemnifications by Buyer
provided for in the first sentence of this section shall expressly cover and
include such matters. Should any conflict exist or appear to exist between
this Section and Section 12 above, this Section shall control. THE FOREGOING

and liabilities arising from third party claims and relating to Seller\'s
ownership and/or operation of the Properties before the Effective Date
(including, without limitation, those arising under the Contracts) and (ii) to
indemnify and hold Buyer (and its affiliates, and the respective directors,
officers, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties)
harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys\' fees) of any kind or character arising
from (A) Seller\'s breach of any of the representations or warranties
contained in Section 4(a) hereof (the "Warranty Indemnities"), (B) Seller\'s
ownership and/or operation of the Properties before the Effective Date (which
shall include third party claims for nonpayment or incorrect payment on
royalty under the Leases or incorrect payment or nonpayment by Seller of
severance taxes (such third party claims with respect to royalty and severance
taxes being called the "Royalty and Tax Indemnities")) and (C) the litigation
listed on Exhibit 4(a)(v) (the "Litigation Indemnities"). Should any conflict
exist or appear to exist between this Section and Section 12 above, this
Section shall control. THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS SHALL
APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS,
ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES
ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SINGLE NEGLIGENCE,
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT
INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE) OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR (ii) STRICT
LIABILITY.

   

14. _No Commissions Owed._ Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer (and its affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to have been made by, or on behalf of, Seller with any broker or finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller (and its affiliates and the respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to have been made by, or on behalf of, Buyer with any broker or finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.

 

15. _Casualty Loss._ In the event of damage by fire or other casualty to the Properties prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and in such event:

   

(a) _Oil and Gas Properties._ As to each such Property so damaged which is an
Oil and Gas Property, that Seller does not repair such damage prior to
Closing, which Seller shall have no obligation to do, in which case all rights
to insurance proceeds, and claims against third parties, related thereto shall
belong to Seller), then (i) at the election of either Buyer or Seller, such
Property shall be treated as if it had an Asserted Defect associated with it
and the procedure provided for in Section 8 shall be applicable thereto and
for the purposes of this Section 15 only, such Defect must be asserted before
Closing (in which case, unless Buyer and Seller agree to the contrary, all
rights to insurance proceeds, and claims against third parties, related
thereto shall belong to Seller), or, (ii) if no such election is made by Buyer
or Seller, the Purchase Price will not be adjusted, and Seller shall, at
Seller\'s election, either collect (and when collected pay over to Buyer) any
insurance claims related to such damage, or assign to Buyer such insurance
claims, and, in either event, Buyer shall take title to the Property affected
by such loss without reduction of the Purchase Price.

 

(b) _Other Properties._ As to each such Property so damaged which is other
than an Oil and Gas Property, Seller shall, repair such damage or replace such
Property.

   

Seller has no obligation to carry insurance coverage (or, if it carries
insurance, to keep such insurance in force or to carry any particular types or
amounts of coverage), and in the event of a loss which is not covered by
insurance, Seller shall have no obligation to Buyer with respect thereto;
provided that, if Buyer so requests, and if Seller has not repaired the damage
or replaced the Property and if Buyer has not elected option (i) in subsection
(a) above, Seller will assign any rights it may have against third parties
with respect to such damage.

 

16. _Notices._ All notices and other communications required under this Agreement shall (unless otherwise specifically provided herein) be in writing and be delivered personally, by recognized commercial courier or delivery service which provides a receipt, by telecopier (with receipt acknowledged), or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid), at the following addresses:

party, in the manner provided in this Section, at least ten (10) days prior to
the effective date of such change of address.

18. _Registration of Energen Common Stock._ It is the understanding of Buyer and Energen that Seller intends to distribute to the members of Seller as of Closing (the "Members") the Energen Common Stock constituting a portion of the Purchase Price. The provisions of this Section shall be effective only as to those Members that have received a distribution of the Energen Common Stock and have executed and delivered to Energen the Stockholders\' Agreement (the "Selling Members") prior to the filing of the registration statement described below.

 

(a) _Registration.

     _

(i) _Filing of Registration Statement _._ _As soon as reasonably practicable

has advised Buyer in writing at or after the Closing the Selling Members have
completed their review of a draft of the registration statement pursuant to
subsection (b)(i) and furnished to Energen all required information pursuant
to subsection (c)(i), Energen shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare
and cause to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a
registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form or, if Form S-3 or a
successor form is not available, on any other appropriate form as may then be
available to Energen under the Securities Act) relating to the resale of the

best efforts (y) to cause such registration statement to be declared effective
by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing of such
registration statement, and (z) to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for the duration of the applicable
Registration Period (as defined herein). Energen will pay all registration and
filing fees, all fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and other
persons retained by Energen, all other expenses incurred by Energen in
connection with Energen\'s performance of or compliance with the provisions of
this Section 18 (excluding underwriting discounts and fees, selling
commissions and transfer taxes applicable to the sale of Registrable Shares
and excluding the cost of any separate legal counsel or other advisors
retained by the Seller or any Selling Member). In no event shall Energen be
required to file more than one registration statement under this Section 18,
and Energen shall not be required to amend or supplement any registration
statement or prospectus included therein to add any additional selling
stockholders after the initial filing of the registration statement.

 

(ii) _Defined Terms._ The term "Registrable Shares" shall mean the Shares and
any Energen Common Stock issued as stock dividends thereon or stock splits
thereof; _provided_ , that the term "Registrable Shares" shall not include any
Shares which (i) have been sold or otherwise transferred by a Selling Member
or (ii) shall have ceased to be outstanding. The term "Registration Period"
with respect to the registration statement filed pursuant to this Section
shall mean a period that shall run from the date on which such registration
statement has been declared effective by the SEC and shall expire on the
earlier of (x) the first date on which the Selling Members are permitted to
sell all of the Registrable Shares pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act or (y) the date upon which there shall
cease to be any Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement.

   

(b) _Registration Procedure._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Section, Energen shall, in effecting any registration of Registrable
Shares pursuant to this Section:

   

(i) _Pre-Filing Draft of Registration Statement._ Prior to the initial filing
of a registration statement with the SEC, furnish to one law firm selected by
the Selling Members copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (other
than the exhibits to the registration statement), and such counsel shall be
given the reasonable opportunity to communicate any comments it may have on
such documents (which comments will be primarily limited to information
concerning the Selling Members and their plans of distribution and other
issues reasonably related to a Selling Member as a selling stockholder);

 

(ii) _Filing of Amendments._ Use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and
file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the registration
statement, and the prospectus used in connection with the registration
statement, as may be reasonably necessary to keep the registration statement
effective for the applicable Registration Period;

 

(iii) _Furnishing Copies of Filings._ Furnish to the Selling Members copies of
the registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto and the
prospectus included in the registration statement (including each preliminary
prospectus) as Selling Members shall reasonably request;

 

(iv) _Changes to Registration Statement, Etc._ Notify the Selling Members
whose Shares are being registered, at any time when a prospectus relating to
the registration statement is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such time as Energen discovers
any facts or circumstances which cause the prospectus included in the
registration statement to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or to
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of circumstances then
existing; after the date of such notification to the Selling Members, Energen
will use its reasonable best efforts (subject to the provisions of subsection
(c)(iii) below) to, within five business days, make filings under the Exchange
Act and, to the extent required, prepare and furnish to the Selling Members a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus and to cause the prospectus and
registration statement to be appropriately supplemented and amended so that
such prospectus and registration statement will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of circumstances then existing;

 

(v) _Stop Orders._ Notify the Selling Members of any stop order issued or
threatened by the SEC and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

     

(c) _Certain Additional Covenants of Energen, Seller and the Selling Members.

     _

(i) _Furnishing Information to Energen._ The Seller and the Selling Members
whose Shares are being registered shall furnish to Energen such information
regarding the Seller, the Selling Members, the distribution by the Selling
Members of the Registrable Shares and such other matters related thereto as
Energen may from time to time reasonably request. The Seller, the Selling
Members and their representatives shall cooperate with Energen and its
representatives to the extent reasonably required, and shall take such other
actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate or as may be reasonably
requested by Energen (at Energen\'s cost), in connection with the performance
by Energen of its obligations under this Section. The Seller or Selling
Members shall notify Energen as soon as reasonably practicable after such time
as the Seller or Selling Members obtain actual knowledge of any facts or
circumstances which cause the prospectus included in a registration statement
to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of circumstances then existing.

 

(ii) _Discontinuing Sales Until Prospectus is Corrected._ The Selling Members
agree that, upon receipt of any notice from Energen of the happening of any
event of the kind described in subsection (b)(iv) above or upon the delivery
of a similar notice to Energen by a Selling Member pursuant to subsection
(c)(i) above, the Selling Members will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Shares pursuant to the registration statement covering such
Registrable Shares until receipt by the Selling Members of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by such subsection (b)(iv) and
(c)(i) above, and, if so directed by Energen, the Selling Members will deliver
to Energen (at Energen\'s cost) all copies, other than permanent file copies
then in the Selling Members\' possession, of the prospectus covering such
Registrable Shares current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 

(iii) _Discontinuing Sales Due to Disadvantageous Condition._ With respect to
the registration statement filed or to be filed pursuant to this Section, if
Energen determines that, in its good faith judgment, it would (because of the
existence of, or in anticipation of, (A) any acquisition or disposition
transaction which is proposed or entered into involving Energen or any
subsidiary of Energen, (B) any financing activity involving Energen or any
subsidiary of Energen, or (C) any other event or condition of material
significance to Energen or any subsidiary of Energen) be significantly
disadvantageous (any of the events described in clauses (A) through (C) above,
hereinafter referred to as a "Disadvantageous Condition") to Energen or any of
its subsidiaries for such registration statement to become effective or to be
maintained effective or for sales of Registrable Shares to continue pursuant
to such registration statement, Energen shall, notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, be entitled, upon the giving of a written notice
(a "Delay Notice") to such effect to the Selling Members, (x) to cause offers
and sales of Registrable Shares by the Selling Members pursuant to such
registration statement to cease, or (y) in the event no such registration
statement has yet been filed, to delay filing any such registration statement,
until, in the good faith judgment of Energen, such Disadvantageous Condition
no longer exists. In no event shall any Delay Notices given by Energen be
effective for an aggregate of more than 60 days in any three month period or
an aggregate of more than 90 days in any twelve month period.

     

(d) _Indemnification.

     _

(i) _Indemnification by Energen._ In connection with the registration of the
Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement,
Energen will, and it hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the Selling Members, each director, officer, manager,
controlling person (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and affiliate of
a Selling Member and each other person who acts on a Selling Member\'s behalf
in the offering or sale of such securities (collectively, the "Member
Indemnitees"), against any and all losses, claims, fines, penalties, damages
or liability, joint or several, and expenses (including any amounts paid in
any settlement effected with Energen\'s prior consent and reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements) to which such Member Indemnitees may become subject
under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, fines, penalties, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
respect thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (A) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any
registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
Energen will reimburse such Member Indemnitees for any legal or any other
expense reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding as they are
incurred; _provided_ that Energen shall not be liable in any such case to any
Member Indemnitee or group of Member Indemnitees to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or
expenses arose out of or was based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission which was made or done in any such
registration statement, any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus
contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and
conformity with information furnished to Energen or its representatives in
writing specifically for use therein by or at the direction of any Member
Indemnitee or group of Member Indemnitees or by any of their respective
representatives; _provided_ _further_ that Energen will not be liable to any
such Member Indemnitees with respect to any preliminary prospectus as then
amended or supplemented, as the case may be, to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability of such Member Indemnitees results from the fact
that such Member Indemnitees sold Registrable Shares to a person to whom there
was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a
copy of the final prospectus (including any documents incorporated by
reference therein), as then amended or supplemented, if Energen has previously
furnished copies thereof to such Member Indemnitees and such final prospectus,
as then amended and supplemented, has corrected any such misstatement or
omission. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any Member Indemnitee and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Shares by the Selling Members.

 

(ii) _Indemnification by the Selling Members._ In connection with the
registration of the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act pursuant to
this Section, each Selling Member whose Shares are being registered hereby
agrees that it will severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, Energen, each director, officer,
controlling person (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and affiliate of
Energen and each other person who acts on Energen\'s behalf in the offering or
sale of such securities (collectively, the "Energen Indemnitees"), against any
and all losses, claims, fines, penalties, damages or liabilities, and expenses
(including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with such Selling
Member\'s prior consent and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) to
which Energen or any Energen Indemnitee may become subject under the
Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
fines, penalties, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect
thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (A) any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration
statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (but only to the extent that such
misstatements or omissions referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above were made,
done or omitted in any such registration statement, any such preliminary,
final or summary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished to Energen or its
representatives in writing specifically for use therein by or at the direction
of such Selling Member or any of its representatives). Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of Energen or any Energen Indemnitee and shall survive the transfer of
the Registrable Shares by the Selling Member.

 

(iii) _Notices of Claims, Etc._ Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
hereunder of notice of any demand or the commencement of any action or
proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made
pursuant to this subsection (d), such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, promptly give
written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; _provided_
that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the
preceding subsections of this Section, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any
action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any
other indemnifying parties similarly notified to the extent that it may wish,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice
from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to
assume the defense of any such action, the indemnifying party will not be
liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof (unless in such
indemnified party\'s reasonable judgment any meaningful conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such
claim after the assumption of the defense thereof) and the indemnifying party
will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its
reasonable consent. No indemnifying party will consent to entry of judgment or
enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. An
indemnifying party who elects not to assume the defense of a claim will not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim
(unless in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified parties additional
counsel are necessary to address conflicts of interest between the indemnified
parties, in which case the indemnifying party shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of such additional counsel).

 

(iv) _Contribution._ If the indemnification provided for in this subsection
(d) from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party for any
loss, claim, fines, penalties, damage, liability or expense covered thereby,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such loss, claim, fine, penalty, damage, liability or expense. The
contribution of such indemnifying party shall be limited to the proportionate
share of the amount paid or payable that reflects the relative fault of the
indemnifying party with respect to such loss, claim, damage, liability, or
expense; provided that the maximum amount to be contributed by any Selling
Member indemnifying party shall not exceed the net amount of proceeds received
by such Selling Member pursuant to the sale of securities in connection with
the registration set forth in this Section. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact was made by or relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party and the intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission of the
indemnifying party. The indemnifying and indemnified parties agree that it
would not be just and equitable to determine contribution under this
subsection (d) by pro rata allocation or by any other method which does not
take into account the equitable considerations referred to above.

     

19. _Certain Agreements Regarding Westbrook Southeast Unit._ Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer that it will obtain, on or before the Closing Date, the execution and delivery of that certain Ratification of Ninth Amendment to Unit Agreement Westbrook Southeast Unit, Mitchell County, Texas (the "Ratification"), by (i) working interest owners in the Westbrook Southeast Unit (the "Westbrook Unit") whose aggregate working interests committed to the Westbrook Unit equal at least 85% of the working interests in the lands covered by the Westbrook Unit and (ii) royalty interest owners committed to the Westbrook Unit whose aggregate royalty interests equal at least 65% of the total royalty interest in the lands covered by the Westbrook Unit. If Seller fails to comply with its covenant and agreement as set forth above in this Section 19, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows: (a) at Closing, Buyer shall be permitted to withhold from the Purchase Price payable at closing 217,391 shares of Energen Common Stock (the "Holdback Shares"); (b) subject to clause (c) below, within two business days after the date on which the requisite working interest owners in the Westbrook Unit and royalty interest owners in the Westbrook Unit execute and deliver the Ratification as provided above, Buyer shall deliver to Seller certificates evidencing the Holdback Shares; and (c) if the requisite working interest owners in the Westbrook Unit and royalty interest owners in the Westbrook Unit fail to execute and deliver the Ratification on or before one year from the date of Closing as provided above, Buyer shall be entitled to retain the Holdback Shares and the Purchase Price shall be deemed reduced.

 

20. _Miscellaneous Matters.

 

   _

(a) _Further Assurances._ After the Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver,
and shall otherwise cause to be executed and delivered, from time to time,

the Properties (regardless of whether such imbalances or make-up obligations
arise at the wellhead, pipeline, gathering system or other level, and
regardless of whether the same arise under contract or otherwise), to the
extent, and only to the extent, such production imbalances and make-up
obligations are disclosed on Exhibit 4(a)(xvi). As a result of such
succession, Buyer shall (i) be entitled to receive any and all benefits which
Seller would have been entitled to receive by virtue of such position
(including, without limitation, rights to produce and receive volumes of
production in excess of volumes which it would otherwise be entitled to
produce and receive by virtue of ownership of the Properties and rights to
receive cash balancing payments), and (ii) be obligated to suffer any
detriments which Seller would have been obligated to suffer by virtue of such
position (including, without limitation, the obligation to deliver to others

ownership of the Properties, to deliver production to purchasers hereof
without receiving full payment therefor, or to make cash balancing payments or
to repay take or pay payments) and (iii) shall be responsible for any and all

hold Seller (and its affiliates, and its and their directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents) harmless, for any and all sales,
transfer or other similar taxes (including related penalty, interest or legal
costs) due by virtue of this transaction on the Properties transferred
pursuant hereto and the Buyer shall remit such taxes at that time. Seller and
Buyer agree to cooperate with each other in demonstrating that the
requirements for exemptions from such taxes have been met.

 

(e) _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and its Exhibits contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions
among the parties with respect to such subject matter; provided that any

such state.

 

(h) _Headings, Time of Essence, etc._ The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Within this

gender, and words in the singular shall be held and construed to cover the
plural, unless the context otherwise requires. Time is of the essence in this
Agreement.

contained in subsection (i) above, the Agreement shall be binding on and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

this transaction at its expense.

advised Buyer that Seller intends to convert from a Delaware limited liability
company to a Delaware limited partnership (the "Conversion") on or prior to
