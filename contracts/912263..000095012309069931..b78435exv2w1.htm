 (a) No fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of BPW Common Stock otherwise entitled to a 

   ##### 

  

    

fractional share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7(a) will be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.8, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional
share of Company Common Stock representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
(reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one
or more transactions of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the excess of
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the Company pursuant to Section 2.9(a) over (ii) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Company Common Stock to be distributed to
the holders of shares of BPW Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.9(b) (such
excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). The Parties acknowledge
that payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock
is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to the
Company of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of shares of BPW Common Stock
that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Company Common Stock,
shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE in the
manner provided in the following paragraph. 

  

 (b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of shares of BPW Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Company Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of BPW Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of BPW Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of BPW Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of shares of BPW Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of shares of BPW Common Stock would otherwise be entitled. 

  

 (c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of BPW Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.9. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Surrender of BPW Common Stock; Transfer Books_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to BPW to act as agent for BPW Stockholders in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall receive the Merger Consideration to which BPW Stockholders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient shares of Company Common Stock to make all exchanges pursuant to Section 2.9(b). The Exchange Agent shall cause the shares of Company Common Stock and dividends or distributions with respect thereto deposited by the Company to be (i) held for the benefit of 

    ##### 

 

  

BPW Stockholders and (ii) promptly applied to making the exchanges and
payments provided for in Section 2.9(b). Such shares of Company Common Stock
and dividends or distributions with respect thereto shall not be used for any
purpose that is not provided for herein. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each BPW Stockholder whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, after giving effect to any required withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof (A) a certificate in respect of the Merger Consideration representing that number of whole shares of Company Common Stock, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7(a), with respect to each Certificate formerly representing shares of BPW Common Stock, (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8, and (C) any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(e), in each case without interest, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of BPW Common Stock it theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8 and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.9(e), in each case without interest. If the exchange of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in respect of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid any Transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash or exchange of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (c) At any time after the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Company shares of Company Common Stock, cash and any other instruments in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been distributed to holders of Certificates. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate, representing shares converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a) may surrender such Certificate to the Company and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the consideration payable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Section 2.8 or Section 2.9(e), as applicable, in each case without interest, but shall have no greater rights against the Company than may be accorded to general creditors of the Company under applicable law in respect of the Merger Consideration. If any Certificates 

    ##### 

  

 

shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any stockholder of
BPW (or BPW Stockholder) for any part of the Merger Consideration that has
been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of BPW shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of BPW Common Stock on the records of BPW. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership of BPW Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of BPW Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. 

   

 (e) No dividends or other distributions declared or paid after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Person is entitled, if any, and no Merger Consideration, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8, shall be paid to such holder until the holder of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such surrender or submission, the Company shall cause to be paid to the Person in whose name the certificates representing the Company Common Stock shall be issued in respect of such surrendered Certificate any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock to which such Person is entitled, if any, which have a record date after the Effective Time and shall have become payable between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender, in each case without interest. In no event shall the Person entitled to receive such dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest thereon. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Company Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock) in respect of the Merger Consideration, if any, and dividends or distributions, if any, as may be required to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Section 2.8 and Section 2.9(e); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. 

   

 (a) The Company or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or dividends or 

    #####

stockholder of BPW (or BPW Stockholder) such amounts as the Company or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the BPW Stockholder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Company or the Exchange
Agent.

and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact and copies of any
proposed agreement relating thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, BPW shall
keep the Company fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes

the financial or other terms of a BPW Acquisition Proposal shall be treated
as a new BPW Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3. BPW shall
also promptly (but in any event within 24 hours), notify the Company, orally
and in writing, if it provides any nonpublic information or enters into any
discussions or negotiations with respect to a BPW Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 6.3(b). 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit BPW from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that disclosure to stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 relating to a BPW Acquisition Proposal or a proposal regarding a Business Combination (other than the transactions contemplated hereby) shall be deemed to be a qualification, withdrawal or modification, of the BPW Recommendation unless the BPW Board expressly, and without qualification, reaffirms in such disclosure the BPW Recommendation.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to replace the Commitment Letter with an Alternative Financing Arrangement (as defined in the Commitment Letter) for not less than the full principal amount of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that the terms and conditions (including with respect to conditionality and amounts available to be borrowed by the Company on the Closing Date) are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Commitment Letter (or as otherwise agreed to in writing by BPW).

 Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall provide exculpation and indemnification for each Person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, or director of BPW, (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") which is at least as favorable to such persons as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by BPW immediately prior to the Effective Time in their respective Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date hereof; _provided,_ that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on or prior to the Effective Time, including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) In addition to the rights provided in Section 6.10(a), in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any action by or on behalf of any or all security holders of the Company or BPW, or any Subsidiary of the Company, or by or in the right of the Company or BPW, or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (collectively, for this Section 6.10, " _Claims_ ") in which any Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer or director of BPW or any action or omission or alleged action or omission by such Person in his capacity as an officer or director, or (ii) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Company (the " _Indemnifying_   _Parties_ ") shall from and after the Effective Time jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement arising out of or relating to any such Claims. The Company, the Surviving Company and the Indemnified Parties hereby agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the defense of such Claims. In connection with any such Claim, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select and retain one counsel, at the cost of the Indemnifying Parties, subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and more than one counsel if, in the opinion of such counsel, the interests of such Indemnified Parties with respect to such Claim diverge or could be reasonably expected to diverge. In addition, after the Effective Time, in the event of any such threatened or actual Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly pay and advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred by each Indemnified Person as they become due and payable in advance of the final disposition of the Claim to the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party, such undertaking to be accepted without regard to the creditworthiness of the Indemnified Party, to repay any expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a court that any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the 

    ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties
the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10,
upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Parties of such Claim and the relevant facts and circumstances with
respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties except to
the extent such failure to notify actually prejudices the Indemnifying
Parties ability to defend such Claim. 

   

 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, the Company shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect BPWs current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by BPWs directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable in the aggregate to BPWs directors and officers, as the case may be, currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement ( _provided,_ that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous);  _provided that_ , in satisfying such obligation, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay premiums per annum in excess of 300% of the aggregate amount per annum that BPW paid for such coverage in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof, which amount BPW has disclosed to the Company prior to the date hereof; _provided further_ that, in the event that the aggregate premiums for maintaining such insurance for the benefit of the persons currently covered by BPWs officers and directors insurance policy under this Section 6.10(c) are in excess of 300% of the aggregate amount per annum, then the Company shall only be obligated to maintain such insurance coverage as is reasonably available for such amount. 

   

 (d) This Section 6.10 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company, including the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.10 and the Company acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section 6.10. 

   

 Section 6.11 _Takeover Laws_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and BPW shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or by any of the Ancillary Agreements, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement any by the Ancillary Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

The monies in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to BPW in limited amounts from time to time (and, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.12, in no event more than $4,500,000 in total) in order to permit BPW to pay its operating expenses; (ii) if BPW completes a Transaction, to certain dissenting public stockholders, to the underwriters in the amount of underwriting discounts and commissions they earned in the IPO but whose payment they have deferred, and, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.12, then to BPW; and (iii) if BPW fails to complete a Transaction within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the agreement governing the Trust Account, to BPW in limited amounts to permit BPW to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to BPWs public stockholders (as such term is defined in the Trust Account Agreement). Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.12, for and in consideration of BPWs agreement to enter into this Agreement, the Company, Merger Sub and each of the Company Stockholders hereby waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind it has or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and agrees not to seek recourse (whether directly or indirectly) against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom (except amounts released to BPW as described in clauses (i) or (ii) above) as a result of, or arising out of, any claims against BPW or otherwise arising under this Agreement or otherwise. BPW has executed and delivered to the Trust Agent an irrevocable instruction providing that, in the event that (a) BPW shall have consummated a Business Combination, and (b) the Termination Fee and/or the Expenses incurred by the Company up to the Maximum Expense Amount (together with any documented expenses associated with the recovery of such amounts to the extent payable under Section 8.2(e)) shall have become due and payable by BPW to the Company under Section 8.2(c) and, to the extent applicable, under Section 8.2(e), and in each such case shall not have been previously paid, the Trust Agent shall be irrevocably instructed to deliver and shall deliver from the Trust Account, in the manner of priority set forth in the Trust Account Agreement but prior to any distribution to BPW, to an account designated by the Company, immediately available funds in an amount equal to any previously unpaid portion of such Termination Fee and/or the Expenses incurred by the Company up to the Maximum Expense Amount (together with any documented expenses associated with the recovery of such amounts to the extent payable under Section 8.2(e)). 

   

 Section 6.13 _Pre-Closing Confirmation and Certification_. Not later than 48 hours prior to the Closing, BPW shall give Mellon advance notice of the Effective Time. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Mellon written notification that the Closing has occurred and irrevocable written instructions with respect to the funds in the Trust Account to deliver such funds (i) to make the Debt Repayment under and as defined in the A Agreement and (ii) with respect to the payments referred to in Section 2.7(d)).

 Section 6.14 _Other Matters_.

 (b) If the Effective Time does not occur prior to February 20, 2010, the BPW Board shall take such actions as are necessary to file the Initial Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware such that the same shall be in full force and effect prior to February 26, 2010. 

   

 Section 6.15 _Ancillary Agreements_. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each other party to any Ancillary Agreement to which it a party to (a) perform and comply in all material respects with all obligations required of each such other party thereunder and (b) consummate the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms thereof (including by taking enforcement action to cause such performance, compliance and consummation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Party shall agree to amend any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, or terminate, or waive, release or assign any material right or claim under, any such Ancillary Agreement, in either case, in a manner adverse to the other Party without the other Partys prior written consent.
