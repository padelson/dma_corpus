     SECTION 2.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VIII, and in accordance with the MGBCL, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 2.02), Purchaser shall be merged with and into the

corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

     SECTION 2.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable after

requirements of the MGBCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri.
The Merger shall become effective at the time of the issuance of the certificate

("Closing") shall be held at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, or such other place as the parties
shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the
case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VIII.

     SECTION 2.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the MGBCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each
of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 2.04 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) At the Effective
Time, and subject to Section 7.06(a), the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Articles of Incorporation.

     (b) At the Effective Time, and subject to Section 7.06(a), the Bylaws of
the Company shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such Bylaws.

     SECTION 2.05 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the
directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving

                                       7

<PAGE>


Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the MGBCL, the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

                                  ARTICLE III
                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     SECTION 3.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

          (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (other than the Shares cancelled in accordance with Section
     3.01(b) and Dissent Shares (as hereinafter defined), if any) shall be
     cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
     from the Surviving Corporation $43.90 per share in cash, without interest
     (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender,
     in the manner provided in Section 3.04 of the certificate or certificates
     which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced such Shares.

          (b) Each Share that is held by the Company as treasury stock or by any
     of its Subsidiaries and any Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser immediately
     prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
     to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
     therefor.

          (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
     Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
     and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
     Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 3.02 Employee Stock Options. The Company shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to, effective as of the Effective Time, terminate the
Company Stock Option Plans, as amended through the date of this Agreement, (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause, effective at or prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, a "Stock Option")
granted under the 1987 Long-Term Incentive Plan that is outstanding and
unexercised prior to the Effective Time, to either (A) be exercised or
terminated prior to the Effective Time or (B) be cancelled as of the Effective
Time to the extent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation in the immediately following
sentence), (iii) cause each Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
prior to the Effective Time under the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan to become
fully vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time and be cancelled as of
the Effective Time to the extent in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the obligations of the Surviving Corporation in the immediately
following sentence) and (iv) cause each Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised prior to the Effective Time under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan
to become fully vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time and either
(A) be exercised or terminated prior to the Effective Time or (B) be cancelled
as of the Effective

                                       8

<PAGE>


Time to the extent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation in the immediately following
sentence). Each holder of a Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per share
that is less than the per share Merger Consideration applicable to the Shares
issuable to the holder of such Stock Option upon exercise shall be entitled
(subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 3.02) to be paid
by the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, in exchange
for the cancellation of such Stock Option, an amount in cash, with respect to
each Share subject to the Stock Option, equal to the excess of the applicable
per share Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Share over the
applicable per share exercise price of such Stock Option. Any payments made
pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be subject to all applicable federal, state
and local Tax withholding requirements.

     SECTION 3.03 Dissent Rights. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by the MGBCL, Shares that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value
of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
351.455 of the MGBCL (collectively, the "Dissent Shares") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
shareholders shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissent
Shares in accordance with and subject to Section 351.455 of the MGBCL; provided,
however, that if any holder of Dissent Shares shall have failed to perfect or
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to be paid fair value under
Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, then the right of such holder to be paid fair
value for such Dissent Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable
for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
that formerly evidenced such Shares, in the manner provided in Section 3.04.

     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
payment of the fair value of any Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the MGBCL and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value under the MGBCL.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

     SECTION 3.04 Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books. (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders
of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(a). Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause Purchaser to, transfer such funds to the Paying Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Such funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's

                                       9

<PAGE>


Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1
billion. Any net profit resulting from, or interest income produced by, such
investments shall be payable to Parent.

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three
business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to
each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates, to
the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and with such additional
provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter
of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be
canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of
such Certificate. If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender such
holder's Certificates because such Certificates have been lost, mutilated or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and, if required
by the Surviving Corporation, indemnity bond in form and substance and with
surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation.

     (c) At any time following the nine-month anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds that had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available
to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only
as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may
be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.

     (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the

                                       10

<PAGE>


holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law.

     SECTION 3.05 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise

                                       12

acquire any outstanding securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, to vote or
to dispose of any Shares or any capital stock of any Subsidiary or to make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
Subsidiary or any other person. None of the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
to any shareholders' agreement, voting trust agreement or registration rights
agreement relating to any equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any other Contract relating to disposition, voting or dividends with respect to
any equity securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary, other than the
registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Debentures. No
dividends on the Shares have been declared or have accrued since December 31,

applicable federal securities Laws.

     (c) Each outstanding share of capital stock (or other equity interest) of
each Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and was issued free of preemptive (or similar) rights, and other than the shares
of LabOne of Ohio, Inc. owned by the Ohio Minority Holders, each such share is
owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all options, rights
of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company's or any Subsidiary's
voting, dividend or transfer rights, charges and other encumbrances or liens of

     SECTION 4.04     Authority Relative to this Agreement. (a) The Company has
all necessary corporate power and corporate authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Approval, to consummate the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of
the Merger have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company or its holders of Shares are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than, with respect to the Merger,
(i) obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval and (ii) filing and recording
appropriate merger documents as required by the MGBCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and subject to the effect of general principles of equity (collectively, the
"Enforceability Exceptions"). The Company Board has unanimously


                                       13

<PAGE>


approved this Agreement and no restrictions on business combinations set forth
in the MGBCL shall apply to the Merger.

     (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the Merger
contemplated by this Agreement and directing the submission of this Agreement to
a vote at a meeting of shareholders of the Company, (ii) determining that the
terms of the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders and (iii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, recommending that
the Company's shareholders approve this Agreement. Such resolutions are the only
resolutions necessary in order for the Merger to comply with Article Ten and
Article Twelve of the Company's Articles of Incorporation. In addition, based
upon the representations made in Section 5.07 hereof, the Company Board has
taken all action necessary to render (A) Section 351.407 of the MGBCL and (B)
Section 351.459 of the MGBCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, and to
Parent and Purchaser to the extent of this Agreement, or the Merger. No other
state takeover statute or regulation is applicable to Company with respect to
this Agreement or the Merger.

     (c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger is the approval of
this Agreement by the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding Shares
(the "Requisite Shareholder Approval").

     SECTION 4.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger by the Company
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Articles or the Bylaws or the
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or any equivalent organizational documents)
of any Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and other
authorizations described in Section 4.05(b) of this Agreement have been obtained
and that all filings and other actions described in Section 4.05(b) of this
Agreement have been made or taken, conflict with or violate any Law applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) except with respect to
the Debentures, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or
give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or
asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which the Company or a Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound or affected, except with respect to clause (ii) or (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any United States or non-United States
supranational, national, federal, state, provincial, municipal or local
government, governmental, regulatory or administrative authority, agency,
instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral
body (a

set forth in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or disclosed in the
notes thereto, except for liabilities and obligations (including purchasing
obligations) (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
2004, or (ii) that would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

     (d) Section 4.07(d) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all "management
letters" and other similar letters relating to the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' internal controls and accounting practices that have been received
by the Company from its independent accountants since January 1, 2002 (the

been made available to Parent.

     (e) The Company conducted an assessment of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and found it to be effective to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and, since
such time, to the knowledge of the persons listed on Schedule 1.01(a) hereto,
the Company has obtained no knowledge of any material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. The management of the
Company has (x) implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating
to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities and such controls are
effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and (y) disclosed on a timely basis, based on its most
recent evaluation, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

     (f) Since December 31, 2002, neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor, to
the Company's knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Company or any Subsidiary, has received or otherwise had
or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the

                                       17

<PAGE>


accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or any Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls or
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any Subsidiary
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. To the knowledge
of the Company, no attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary, whether
or not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of

officer, general counsel, the Company Board or any committee thereof.

     SECTION 4.08 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since March 31,

the Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects only
in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past
practice, and (b) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect, and none of
the Company or any Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after the date

Section 6.01(a), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h) or (j) hereto.

     SECTION 4.09 Absence of Litigation. There is no material litigation,
suit, claim, action, proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
investigation (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against the Company or any Subsidiary, by or before any
Governmental Authority. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing investigation
by, any Governmental Authority, or any continuing order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority that
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.10 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 4.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other contracts or
agreements, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, with respect to

contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of
any current or former employee, officer or director of, or any current or former
consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan
for which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur material liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated,
(iii) any material plan in respect of which the Company or any Subsidiary could
incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any material contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, on the other hand,
relating to employee benefits or to the sale of the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Plans"). Each Plan is in writing and the Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of each Plan and has made available
to Parent a true and

                                       18

<PAGE>


complete copy of each of the following, if any, prepared in connection with each
such Plan: (i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each
summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most
recently filed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500, (iv) the most
recently received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, and (v) the most
recently prepared financial statement in connection with each such Plan. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment (i) to
create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or
agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (iii) to
modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by applicable Law, including ERISA or the Code,
or as contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single
employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for
which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Plans provides for or
promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary. Each
of the Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.

     (c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects the obligations to be
performed by them under, and are not in any material respect in default under or
in violation of, any Plan.

     (d) For each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or
Section 401(k) of the Code, the IRS has issued a favorable "GUST" determination
letter (taking into account the changes in the qualification requirements made
by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the Small Business Job Protection Act of
1996, the Tax Reform Act of 1997, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998
and the Community Renewal Relief Act of 2000) that has not been revoked, and no
events have occurred that would have or that would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the qualified status of such Plans or a loss
of the tax-exempt status of the related trust. The Company has timely adopted
all amendments to the Company's 401(k) Plan required by the Code (and the
applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder), ERISA or other applicable
law, including, without limitation, amendments required by the Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and
the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder. To the knowledge of the
Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination
letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

     (e) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any material liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA, including any
liability in connection with (i) the termination or

                                       19

<PAGE>


reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii)
the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and to the
knowledge of the Company no fact or event exists that could give rise to any
such liability.

     (f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made prior to
the date hereof with respect to any Plan have been made in all material respects
on or before their due dates. No deduction with respect to any Plan for income
Tax purposes has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and
no fact or event exists which could reasonably give rise to any such challenge
or disallowance, except for any failure that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     (g) Except as provided in Section 3.02, (i) neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of the principal terms of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, or (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Plans and (ii) none of the Plans in effect on the date of this
Agreement would result separately or in the aggregate (including as a result of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) in the payment of any
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

     (h) The Company and each Subsidiary has timely given any and all notices
and taken any other actions required with respect to the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or other similar Laws of any
state or other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 4.11 Labor and Employment Matters. There are no controversies
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company or
any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of their respective employees, on the
other hand, which controversies would have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreement
or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or
any Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, are there any activities
or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees. There are no
unfair labor practice complaints pending against the Company or any Subsidiary
before the National Labor Relations Board or any current union representation
questions involving employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. There is no
strike, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threat thereof, by or with respect to any employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary. All individuals classified by the Company or any Subsidiary as
independent contractors have been properly classified as non-employees for
purposes of applicable Laws, except as would not be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     SECTION 4.12 Information Supplied. The Proxy Statement that will be
mailed to shareholders of the Company in connection with the Company
Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 7.01) shall not, on the date the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed or
otherwise disseminated to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material

                                       20

<PAGE>

fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading, or
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting which shall
have become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
Parent, Purchaser or any of Parent's or Purchaser's representatives for
inclusion in the foregoing documents. The Proxy Statement shall comply in all
material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

     SECTION 4.13 Real Property; Title to Assets. (a) Section 4.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule lists each parcel of real property owned by the Company or
any Subsidiary and the location of such real property. Each parcel of real

sale agreements, encumbrances, charges or other claims of third parties of any
kind, including, without limitation, any lease, license, occupancy agreement,
easement, right of way or other encumbrance to title, or any option, right of

expropriated or otherwise taken by any Governmental Authority with or without
payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has any
such condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed, except as would not
have materially adversely affected the value or use of the applicable property
owned by the Company or such Subsidiary.

     (b) Section 4.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each parcel of real
property currently leased or subleased by the Company or any Subsidiary that
involves consideration in excess of $100,000 per calendar year or $500,000 in
the aggregate for the remaining term of such lease or sublease (without renewal
of such lease or sublease), and the location of such real property, with the
name of the lessor and the date of the lease, sublease, assignment of the lease,
any guaranty given or leasing commissions payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection therewith and each amendment to any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Lease Documents"). True, correct and complete copies of all
Lease Documents have been made available to Parent. All such current leases and
subleases are in full force and effect, are valid and effective in accordance
with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing material default or event of default (or event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default or event of default) by the
Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Company's knowledge, by the other party to
such lease or sublease, or person in the chain of title to such leased premises,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, neither tenant nor landlord has exercised
any right to terminate such leases and subleases as a result of a default under
such leases and subleases by either tenant or landlord.

Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all patents, patent
application, copyright registrations and applications, trademark registrations
and applications and domain name registrations that are owned by the Company
and/or the Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. The Company and/or the

To the knowledge of the Company, neither the conduct of the Company nor any of

respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause
the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed, as may be required, to the holders of Shares entitled to vote at the
Company Shareholders Meeting at the earliest practicable time.

     SECTION 7.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as
prohibited by applicable Law and subject to any applicable privileges (including
the attorney-client privilege), from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
upon reasonable prior notice, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the
Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and agents of
Parent and Purchaser reasonable access during normal business hours to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities,
books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and the Company shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data and
information as Parent or Purchaser, through its officers, employees or agents,
may reasonably request; provided that such investigation shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any Subsidiary.

     (b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 7.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated April 13, 2005, and Supplement to Confidentiality Agreement,
dated July 14, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent and the
Company.

     (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 7.04 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) The Company agrees that
neither it nor any Subsidiary nor any of the directors, officers or employees of
it or any Subsidiary will, and that it will instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees,
agents, advisors and other representatives (including, without limitation, any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any Subsidiary) not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action
to knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
(including any proposal or offer to its shareholders) that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction, or (ii) enter into
or maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with any person or entity in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction, or (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any Competing
Transaction or enter into any letter of intent or other contract, agreement or
commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Competing Transaction, or
(iv) authorize or permit any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any investment banker,

                                       32

<PAGE>


financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to take any such action. The Company shall
notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one business
day after the Company attains knowledge thereof), orally and in writing, if any
proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person with respect
thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made, specifying the material
terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal
or offer or inquiry or contact (including material amendments or proposed
material amendments). The Company shall, and shall direct or cause its and its
Subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents to,
immediately cease and terminate any discussions or negotiations with any parties
that may have been conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction.
The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party and the
Company also agrees to promptly request each person that has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
(whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) the Company or
any Subsidiary, if any, to return (or if permitted by the applicable
confidentiality agreement, destroy) all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such person by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary and,
if requested by Parent, to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce such
person's obligation to do so. The Company shall not take any action to make the
provisions of Section 351.407, Section 351.015 or Section 351.459 of the MGBCL
and Article X of the Company's Articles of Incorporation inapplicable to any
transaction other the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (x)
neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be prohibited from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure
required under applicable Law or the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, and
(y) any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company or the Company Board
to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or similar communication to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer
containing the substance of a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to
such Rule 14d-9(f)) shall not be considered a Change in the Company
Recommendation (as hereinafter defined) or an approval, recommendation or
proposal to approve or recommend any Competing Transaction.

     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.04, prior to
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, in the event a person (a "Third
Party") makes an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer regarding a
Competing Transaction, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (including,
without limitation, any investment broker, attorney or accountant retained by
the Company or any Subsidiary) may furnish information to such Third Party (it
being understood that any such information furnished to a Third Party not
previously furnished to Parent shall be contemporaneously furnished to Parent),
and enter into and conduct discussions and negotiations with such Third Party,
regarding such proposal or offer, and (B) the Company may release the Third
Party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it is a party to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
the Third Party to make and pursue the proposal or offer; provided, however,
that, prior to furnishing any

                                       33

<PAGE>


such information, conducting any such discussions and negotiations or releasing
or waiving any such provisions, the Company Board shall have (i) determined, in
its good faith judgment (after having received the advice of its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly engaged
independent legal counsel)), that such proposal or offer constitutes or may be
reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) determined, in its good
faith judgment after consultation with independent legal counsel (that may be
the Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that a failure to
furnish such information, enter into such discussions and negotiations or
release or waive such provisions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the Company or its shareholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided prior
written notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information to, or enter into
discussions with, the Third Party, and (iv) obtained from the Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company in
all material respects than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements
shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate
with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying
its obligations under this Agreement).

     (c) Except as set forth in this Section 7.04(c), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement and
the Merger (a "Change in the Company Recommendation") or approve or recommend,
or cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
obligation with respect to, any Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Section 7.04(c), prior to
obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval, if the Company Board has
determined, in its good faith judgment (after having received the advice of its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly
engaged independent legal counsel)), that an unsolicited, written, bona fide
offer from a Third Party constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(h) and enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, (x)
prior to taking any such action contemplated by this Section 7.04(c), the
Company Board shall have determined in its good faith judgment after
consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly
engaged independent legal counsel), that a failure to take any such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company or its shareholders
under applicable Law; (y) prior to entering into a definitive agreement for such
a Superior Proposal (excluding a confidentiality agreement of the type
referenced in Section 7.04(b)), the Company notifies Parent, in writing at least
three business days prior to doing so, of its intention to enter into such
definitive agreement, specifying the material terms of such proposed definitive
agreement and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and Parent
does not make, within three business days of receipt of such written
notification, an offer that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
having received the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel
(who may be the Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel)) is at
least as favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall
not enter into any definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
prior to the expiration of such three business day period; and (z) the Company
shall pay the Fee required under Section 9.03(a)(ii) of this Agreement to Parent
simultaneously with any termination of this Agreement in accordance with

                                       34

<PAGE>


the terms of this Section 7.04(c). In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary in this Section 7.04, the Company Board may make a
Change in the Company Recommendation if it determines, in its good faith
judgment after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the
Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that to do otherwise
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company or its
shareholders under applicable Law.

     SECTION 7.05 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) For a period of one year from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms (without amendment or
modification in a manner adverse to the participants therein) all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to provide an employer stock fund in any defined contribution
plan, or to make any matching or other contributions to such plans in stock;
provided, further, that after the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's subsidiaries shall not
be prohibited from amending, modifying or terminating any such contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments in accordance with
their terms. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Company
Employees") shall receive credit for service accrued prior to the Effective Time
with the Company or any Subsidiary ("Pre-Closing Service") for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) that is
extended to the Company Employees; provided, however, that such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall waive, or cause
to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable
plan of Parent or its subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental
plans, deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in the respective plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs; and provided, further, however, that (i) all Pre-Closing
Service shall be counted for purposes of determining the level of benefits under
any vacation or severance plan following the Effective Time established or
maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) that is extended to Company Employees and (ii) following the
Effective Time, all employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to all unused vacation time accrued as of the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, during the one-year period
following the Effective Time, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation and the
other subsidiaries of Parent to provide to certain employees of the Company and
the Subsidiaries all employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries available to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its subsidiaries; provided that the employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries receive benefits under such employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements that are not less favorable than the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries, in lieu of the employee
benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation.

                                       35

<PAGE>


     (b) Section 7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with respect to
certain executive officers of the Company, the cash severance payment that would
be due to such executive officer under such person's employment agreement with
the Company upon the termination of such person's employment with the Company
after a Change of Control (as defined therein). At the Effective Time, without
limiting the rights of such executive officer under such person's agreements
with the Company, the Surviving Corporation will pay to such executive officer,
pursuant to the employment agreement between the Company and such executive
officer, the amount of the cash severance payment set forth opposite such
person's name in Section 7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 7.06 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a)
The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than those
set forth in the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless
such modification shall be required by Law.

     (b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered on the date of this Agreement by the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are not, in the aggregate, less favorable to any
beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 7.06(b) more than an amount equal to 300% of
current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; provided
further, however, that, if the amount of premium necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Parent shall
maintain or procure, for such six-year period, the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for a premium equal to that
maximum amount. Nothing contained in this Section 7.06(b) or otherwise in this
Agreement is intended to or shall relieve any of the Company's existing
insurance carriers from any obligations that such carriers now have or may in
the future have relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective officers and directors.

     (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 7.06 and
not in limitation thereof (but without in any way limiting or modifying the
obligations of any insurance carrier contemplated by Section 7.06(b) of this
Agreement), for six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by the MGBCL as of the date hereof (assuming the
MGBCL were applicable), indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any
liability to the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries)
the persons who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or directors
of the Company or any Subsidiary or served at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (the "Indemnitees") against all expenses
(including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of
the final disposition of any action, suit or proceeding), losses, claims,
damages, judgments, fines and

                                       36

<PAGE>


amounts paid in settlement that are actually and reasonably incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, that
related to an event, act or omission which occurred prior to the Effective Time
by reason of the fact that such person was at or prior to the Effective Time a
director or officer of the Company or any of its current or former Subsidiaries
(collectively, an "Indemnifiable Claim"). In the event any Indemnifiable Claim
is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
shall continue until such claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees
or other rulings in connection with such claim are fully satisfied.

     (d) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 7.06, and
not in limitation thereof, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
agree that all individual indemnity agreements between the Company and any
Indemnitees, as in effect on the date hereof, set forth in Section 4.18 or
Section 4.20 of the Disclosure Schedule, copies of which have been provided to
Parent prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Effective Time and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

     (e) The provisions of this Section 7.06 will survive the Effective Time and
are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and
his or her heirs and representatives. Parent will pay or cause to be paid all
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, that an
Indemnitee may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 7.06 (subject to reimbursement if the Indemnitee is
subsequently determined not to be entitled to indemnification under Section
7.06).

     (f) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.06.

     SECTION 7.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of which reasonably could be expected to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
(b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder and (c) any other material development relating to the
Company or the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; provided further,
however, that a failure to comply with this Section 7.07 will not constitute the
failure of any condition set forth in Article VIII or Article IX to be satisfied
unless the underlying event would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Article VIII or Article IX to be satisfied.

     SECTION 7.08 Further Action; Reasonable Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement (i) each of the parties hereto shall
make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, under the HSR Act with

                                       37

<PAGE>


respect to the Merger and (ii) each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger as
promptly as practicable, including, without limitation, using its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and Orders of Governmental Authorities as are necessary for the
consummation of the Merger.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent shall, in no event later than ten business days following the date
hereof, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form
("HSR Filing") pursuant to the HSR Act, required for the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party's HSR Filing shall comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the HSR Act, and the Company and Parent shall
request early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act. Each of
the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, provide to the FTC,
DOJ and each and every federal, state, local or foreign governmental entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition laws
all non-privileged information and documents requested by such Governmental
Authority or that is reasonably necessary or advisable to permit consummation of
the transactions. Subject to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall inform the other promptly of any communication made by or on behalf of
such party to (including permitting the other party to review such communication
in advance), or received from, any Governmental Authority relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall furnish to the other
such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is
necessary or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions under
applicable Law. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall furnish the other
party with copies of all substantive or otherwise material correspondence,
filings, and written communications between such party and its affiliates and
their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor Parent or Purchaser shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in
advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. The Company and
Parent shall keep each other timely apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     (c) Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid, resolve or
eliminate each and every objection raised by the FTC, DOJ or any state antitrust
Governmental Authority to the Merger asserted, or suit challenging the Merger
instituted, or other impediment to the Merger under any antitrust or competition
Law, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Merger as promptly as
practicable. For purposes of this Section 7.08, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include Parent committing to and effecting as promptly as practicable, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such of its and its affiliates' assets or operations, and/or of
the assets or operations to be acquired by it pursuant to the Merger, as is
required to be sold, divested or disposed of, including entering into any

                                       38

<PAGE>


agreements required to be entered into by any Governmental Authority in
connection therewith, in order to obtain any required regulatory approval or to
avoid the commencement of any suit or proceeding seeking, and/or to avoid entry
of, and/or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, Order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order that would have the
effect of materially delaying or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;
provided that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall Parent be required to hold separate, sell, divest or dispose of any assets
or operations owned by Parent or its affiliates or by the Company or its
affiliates, which individually or collectively produced aggregate revenues in
calendar year 2004 in excess of the Specified Amount or hold separate, sell,
divest or dispose of any full service laboratory.

     (d) Without limiting the Company's rights under Section 7.04, neither party
shall or shall permit its subsidiaries to consummate another transaction or
enter into an agreement with respect to another transaction or take any other
action if the intent or reasonably likely anticipated consequence of such
transaction or action is, or would be, to cause any Governmental Authority to
delay or not grant approval of, or to take legal action to seek to prevent, the
consummation, in whole or in part, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     (e) Parent's and the Company's obligations under this Section 7.08 shall
include the obligation to use their respective reasonable best efforts to defend
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including using their respective reasonable best efforts to
seek to have any stay or other injunctive relief which would prohibit or
materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement entered by any court or other Governmental Authority reversed on
appeal or vacated.

     (f) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain all consents or
approvals required from third parties other than Governmental Authorities in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable.

     SECTION 7.09 Obligations of Purchaser. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees the full and complete
performance by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its
respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be jointly and severally
liable with Purchaser for any breach of any covenant or obligation of Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.10 Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed
to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ
National Market, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger;

                                       39

<PAGE>


provided, however, that this Section 7.10 shall terminate in the event the
Company Board shall have effected a Change in the Company Recommendation.

     thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act
     shall have expired or been terminated.

          (c) No Order. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,
     promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order that is then in effect
     and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or
     otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

     warranty contained in Section 5.05 of this Agreement) shall be true and
     correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
     the Effective Time, except to the extent that such representations and
     warranties are made as of another date, in which case such representations
     and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
     such other date; and (y) each of the representations and warranties of

     warranties shall be true and correct as of such other date, except in the
     case of either (x) or (y), where any failure of such representations and

     aggregate, prohibit or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
     otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their obligations
     under this Agreement; (ii) the representation and warranty contained in
     Section 5.05 of this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the

     of cure, shall not have been cured within ten business days of receipt by
     the Company of written notice from Parent specifying such breach;

     the Company Recommendation or (ii) approved or recommended, or proposed to
     approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction;

          (g) By the Company or Parent if, upon a vote taken thereon at the

     the Requisite Shareholder Approval is not obtained; or

          (h) By the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
     Shareholder Approval of this Agreement, in accordance with Section 7.04(c)
     in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
     Proposal.

     SECTION 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party hereto or their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors or other representatives, except that (a) Section 7.03(b), this
Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X shall survive termination and (b)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability or damages arising out of
any intentional or willful breach of any covenant in this Agreement prior to

     thereof) pursuant to Section 9.01(g), and (A) in the case of termination
     pursuant to Section 9.01(g), prior to the vote by the Company's
     shareholders on this Agreement, a Competing Transaction shall have been
     publicly announced and not withdrawn, or has otherwise become publicly
     known after the date of this Agreement, and (B) in the case of termination
     pursuant to either clause (i) of Section 9.01(f) or Section 9.01(g), the
     Company enters into a definitive agreement, within 12 months after such
     termination, relating to a Competing Transaction and such transaction is
     thereafter consummated, the Company shall pay the Fee to Parent on the date
     of completion of such transaction less any Expenses paid to Parent pursuant
     to Section 9.03(b);

          (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(h), the
     Company shall pay the Fee to Parent on the date of such termination; or

     business days of the date of such termination.

     (b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d)

event that the Company shall fail to pay the Fee or Expenses, such Fee or
Expenses shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses actually incurred or

of a willful breach or intentional breach of any covenant in this Agreement
prior to such termination.

party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no such amendment
shall be made except as allowed under applicable Law. Any waiver of any term
shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition
of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     SECTION 10.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any party hereto, except that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of
their rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Parent (who in the
case of Purchaser is a corporation incorporated under Chapter 351 of the MGBCL),
provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than Section 7.06 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

     SECTION 10.06 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at Law or equity.

     SECTION 10.07 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State (other
than those provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the
MGBCL). All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined exclusively in a federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the Merger may not be enforced in or by any of the
above-named courts.

     SECTION 10.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger. Each of the
parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the Merger, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section 10.08.

     SECTION 10.09 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
