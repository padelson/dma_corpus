WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article VII_ , as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver by
Merger Sub of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the
" _Offer Conditions_ ") at any scheduled Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in accordance
with its terms and promptly accept for payment (such time of acceptance for
payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and promptly thereafter pay for, all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. The
Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects holders
of Shares generally, (F) change the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or otherwise
change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by
this Agreement or (H) provide for a "subsequent offering period" (or any
extension thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. The
Offer may not be terminated prior to the Expiration Date, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_.

 



2 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the
Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date
has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date
and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, being
referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows: (i) if, on the
scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or
any of the other Offer Conditions has not been satisfied, or waived by Parent
or Merger Sub if permitted hereunder, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
for one or more periods each consisting of not more than ten (10) business
days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act), with the length of such periods to be determined by Parent,
or such other number of business days as the parties may agree (subject to
the right of Merger Sub to waive any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum
Condition) in accordance with this Agreement and the parties respective
rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ );
and (ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law or the applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or
positions of the SEC or its staff or the NASDAQ. Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date and shall not in any event
extend the Offer beyond the End Date without the Companys prior written
consent.

 

(f) The Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted automatically to reflect the
effect of any change in the fully diluted number of shares of capital stock
of the Company as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or with a record date combination or exchange of shares,
or any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring on or after the
date hereof and at or prior to the Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to
the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.1(f)_ shall be
deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is
not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article
VII_ , Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares
pursuant to the Offer and cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub
to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

(h) On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) file or cause to be
filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal
and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents, which shall be
in 

 



3  customary form, to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, " _Securities Laws_ ").
Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the "
_Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC to
comply in all material respects with applicable Securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Merger Sub or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company required by the
Securities Laws to be set forth in the Offer Documents as well as such other
information concerning the Company and its stockholders that may be required
in connection with any action contemplated by this  _Section 1.1(h)_,
including communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the
Shares. Subject to the right of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to  _Section 5.3_, the
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation. Each party agrees to correct or supplement promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or such amendment or supplement shall become necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so amended
or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each
case, as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Parent and Merger
Sub shall give (x) the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC and (y) due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by the Company and its counsel thereto. Parent and Merger
Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of
such comments. Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer. Parent and Merger Sub agree to give (x) the Company and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written responses to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer and (y) due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel and reasonable
opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with
the staff of the SEC related thereto.

 

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub all of the funds necessary
to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

(j) For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub, any Shares subject to notices of
guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer
unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are
delivered to Merger Sub or to an agent of Merger Sub.

 



4 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, concurrently with or following the filing of the Schedule TO,
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") which
shall (x) include the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by
the Company under Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL in connection with a merger
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (y) subject to the right of
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_, reflect the Company Board
Recommendation, and (z) be disseminated by the Company to its stockholders, in
each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Law (including by
setting the Stockholder List Date (as defined below) as the record date for
the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL). The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the
Company with the SEC to comply in all material respects with applicable
Securities Laws. Each party agrees to correct or supplement promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or such amendment or supplement shall become necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading , and the Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to its stockholders, in each case, as and
to the extent required by the Securities Laws. The Company shall cooperate
with the Parent and Merger Sub in order to permit the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed to the holders of Shares together with the Offer Documents (and if so,
the expense thereof shall be borne by Parent in connection with its
dissemination of the Offer Documents). The Company agrees to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company further agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to promptly be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Securities Laws. The
Company shall give (x) Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
and (y) due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by Parent and its counsel thereto. The Company agrees to provide
Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of such comments. Subject to
the penultimate sentence of this paragraph, the Company shall respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees to give (x) Parent and
its counsel reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written responses
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and
(y) due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Parent and its counsel and reasonable opportunity to
participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the
SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the
Company in the immediately preceding three sentences shall not apply if
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3_.

 



5 (b) The Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all of its stockholders
of record as of a date no more than ten (10) days prior to the date on which
Parent and Merger Sub file the Offer Documents with the SEC (such date, the "
_Stockholder List Date_ "), a non-objecting beneficial owners list and
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders and beneficial owners,
mailing labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial
owners of Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause third parties to,
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents
to the holders of Shares held in or subject to the Company Plans and to
permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares into the Offer. Parent
and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all
copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control.

Sub or any holder of any shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Company and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



7 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Stockholder Shares and shares to
be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), less any required withholding Taxes, if any, as described
in _Section 2.11_. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by
certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_ without interest (subject to
any applicable withholding Tax, if any, as described in _Section 2.11_).

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Dissenting Stockholder Shares_ ", and each stockholder holding
Dissenting Stockholder Shares a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Stockholder Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, without any interest thereon and less any
applicable withholding Taxes, if any, as described in _Section 2.11_. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted written
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii)
the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisals or compromise, offer to settle or
settle, or otherwise make any binding agreement regarding, any such demands.

 



8 Section 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Investment by Paying Agent of Funds_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration and
enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company with the
Paying Agent relating to the services to be performed by the Paying Agent.
Parent shall irrevocably deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent at or prior to the Closing, a cash amount in immediately available funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make all payments of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.7(c)_. The aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other
income from such investments shall be payable by the Paying Agent to Parent as
provided in Parents agreement with the Paying Agent. No investment or
investment losses resulting from such investment by the Paying Agent of
the aggregate Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_ and Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any
funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made
pursuant to this _Section 2.8(a)_. No investment by the Paying Agent of the
aggregate Merger Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to make available or cause to be made available to the
Paying Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to pay the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_  without interest.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than the holders of
Shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_) (i) a letter of transmittal
(which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration, in each case, in a customary form to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to Closing. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common
Stock surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (A) the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such

 



9  payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration in the name of a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Article II_ , without interest.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without interest and subject to any required withholding Taxes,
if any, as described in _Section 2.11_, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_ and
thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article II_
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon and
subject to any required withholding Taxes, if any, as described in _Section
2.11_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



10 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

Section 2.9 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Share that is outstanding shall be converted into a vested
right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is outstanding shall be converted into a vested right to receive cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _that_ , those
Company RSUs granted pursuant to the Producers Retention Plan described in
_Section 5.1(a)(viii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are
outstanding shall be converted into a right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration, which right shall remain subject to the vesting
and payment schedule set forth in _Section 5.1(a)(viii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) _Company Stock Options_. At least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide each holder of a Company Stock Option
with a written notice pursuant to Section 12(c) of the Companys 2007 Global
Share Plan, Section 4.2(c) of the Companys 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan
or Section 4.3(c) of the Companys 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan, as
applicable, which notice shall specify that the holders Company Stock
Options (i) shall not be assumed or substituted for by the Parent, (ii) shall
be fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to, and contingent
upon, the Closing, and (iii) may be exercisable by the holder, as of
immediately prior to and contingent upon, the Closing, on a net-settlement
basis, subject to the holders delivery to the Company of a written notice of
exercise no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, and that
if such holder fails to so exercise such Company Stock Options, such Company
Stock Options that are unexercised as of the Closing shall automatically be
canceled and receive an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares subject to the holders Company Stock Options and (B) the excess, if
any, of (y) the Merger Consideration minus (z) the applicable exercise price;
provided that any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price that is
equal to or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall terminate and be canceled
for no consideration.

(d) _Necessary Actions_. The Company Board, and to the extent required,
any committee thereof, will take such actions as are necessary with respect
to Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and Company Stock Options to
implement the provisions of this _Section 2.9_.

 

(e) _Funding_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary
to fulfill the Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section 2.9_.
All payments required under this _Section 2.9_ shall be made through the
Companys payroll not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the first regular payroll date following the
Effective Time; _provided_ that for Company RSUs that are considered non-
qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, such payments
shall be made at the time required under the applicable arrangement.

 



11 Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities convertible or
exchangeable therefor) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or combination or exchange of shares,
or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall automatically be
equitably adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 2.10_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub, and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
including in connection with both the Offer and the Merger, such amounts that
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any other applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

any remedy under or a right of termination, cancellation, supplement,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit

position of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the consolidated results of
its operations and cash flows, as of each of the dates and for the periods
shown, as applicable, in conformity with GAAP.

 

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
internal control over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since
January, 1 2014, the Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
Audit Committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
were known to the Company and (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud known to
the Company that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting.

(d) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has any
commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among one or more of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), in each case where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Companys published financial statements or other
Company SEC Documents.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations, including in respect of Taxes, which would be required to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except for
liabilities or obligations (i) reflected or reserved against on the balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2016 (the " _Balance
Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC
Documents, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business, (iii) as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise arising in
connection with the Transactions or (iv) otherwise as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Impact.

by the Company of Company Common Stock, (iii) any split, combination or
reclassification of the Company Common Stock, (iv) any disposition of any
material assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, or (v) any authorization
of, or commitment or agreement to take, any of the actions described in
clauses (ii) through (iv).

case, by any Governmental Authority, other than those that would not

(b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent the Company or such Subsidiary is a
party thereto, as applicable, and to the Knowledge of the Company, each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance
with its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), except where
the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Impact. Not later

either delivered or otherwise made available to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of each Company Material Contract as of the date of this
Agreement or has publicly made available such Company Material Contract in the

performed by it under each Company Material Contract and neither the Company
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other party is in breach of or
default under any Company Material Contract and, neither the Company, or to

which have been withdrawn or where the period for the taking of the threatened
action has lapsed without such action having been taken.

 

Section 3.17 _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 4.7_, the
Company Board has taken and will take all actions so that the restrictions
(whether procedural, voting, approval, fairness or otherwise) applicable to
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL are, and will be,
inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Support Agreement, and the timely consummation of the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transaction and will not restrict, impair or delay the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to vote or otherwise exercise all rights as a
stockholder of the Company. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other antitakeover Laws, including Section 203 of the DGCL
(each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or any anti-takeover provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws is, or at the Acceptance Time

as of the date of this Agreement, the opinions of Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC

therein, the Offer Price to be received in the Offer and the Merger
Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of the Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Stockholder Shares and shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.7(b)) is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of the Company Common Stock.

Section 3.19 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co.
LLC and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, no broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.20 _Company Stockholder Approval_. Assuming the Offer is consummated
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and assuming the accuracy of
Parents and Merger Subs representation and warranty set forth in _Section
4.7_, no stockholder votes or consents are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated herein.

Section 3.21 _Insurance_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are insured against such losses and risks and in
such amounts as are customary in the businesses in which they are engaged.
None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in default with respect to any
material provision contained in any material insurance policy nor has the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries failed to give any material notice or
present any material claim under any such policy in due and timely fashion
since January 1, 2014. There are no material outstanding unpaid claims under
any such policy. Since January 1, 2014, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any
such policy.

 

Section 3.22 _Certain Business Practices._ To the Knowledge of the Company,
since January 1, 2014, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective employees or Representatives (in each case, acting in the
capacity of an employee or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such other Person) has (a) used any material funds
(whether of the Company, any Subsidiary or any such other Person or otherwise)
for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses
relating to political activity, (b) made any unlawful payment to foreign
or domestic government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic
political parties or campaigns or (c) violated any provision of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, anti-money laundering laws and any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or any applicable Law of similar effect. Since January
1, 2014, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written communication from a Governmental Authority that alleges any of the
foregoing. The Company utilizes effective controls, procedures and an internal
accounting controls system that it reasonably believes are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that violations of the aforementioned laws,
rules or regulations will be prevented, detected and deterred in all material
respects.

 



29 Section 3.23 _Title to Assets._ Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Impact, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the JV has good and marketable title to,
a valid leasehold interest in, or has the valid and enforceable right to use,
all material personal property and assets used by it in connection with the
conduct of its business as presently conducted, located on its premises or
which are otherwise set forth in the Company SEC Documents, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

Section 3.24 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in this _Article
III_ , neither the Company nor any other Person makes any representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation, forecasts or
other information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

immediately all existing negotiations with any Person or its Representatives
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, immediately
terminate access by any such Person or its Representative to any online data
room maintained by or behalf of the Company, and promptly request that any
such Person and its Representatives promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
previously furnished to them. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,

 



36  from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries respective directors and officers not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly
encourage any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation thereof, (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to
notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_)
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information
in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or
facilitating, a Takeover Proposal or any proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, or (iii) enter
into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or
similar agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or with respect to any
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_,
but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.3(b)_, if the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives
receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made after the
date of this Agreement, which did not result from any breach of this _Section
5.3_, the Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
and the Companys Representatives shall be permitted to (i) furnish, pursuant
to (and only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has
made the Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access and that was not previously provided to Parent, and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal,
in each case only if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to or
constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any inquiries,
proposals, or offers with respect to a Takeover Proposal by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives and provide Parent with a copy of
any written Takeover Proposal received (including any written agreements,
arrangements, understandings, forms of agreements supplied to third parties,
and any other material documents with respect to the Takeover Proposal) and a
written statement with respect to any non-written Takeover Proposal or inquiry
received, which statement shall include the identity of the parties making
the Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms thereof. The Company
will keep Parent reasonably apprised in all material respects on a reasonably
current basis of the status and content of any discussions regarding
any Takeover Proposal with a third party. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.3_ or otherwise
prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under this _Section
5.3_.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including _Section
5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, 

 



37  approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend,
any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 or (D) in the event a tender offer that constitutes a
Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act is
commenced, fail to recommend against such Takeover Proposal in any
solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten
(10) Business Days (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or
permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
agreement or commitment (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
providing for any Takeover Proposal (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (which
Takeover Proposal did not arise out of a breach of _Section 5.3_) that has
not been withdrawn and the Companys Board of Directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Companys Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ to accept
such Takeover Proposal, if and only if (i) the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to the receipt of such Superior Proposal
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent prior written
notice of its intent to take such action and terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ at least five (5) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice shall attach the most current draft of any Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or, if no such
draft exists, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (a " _Notice of Intended Recommendation Change_ ") (it
being understood that such Notice of Intended Recommendation Change shall not
in itself be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that any
change in price or material revision or amendment to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, if applicable, shall require a new notice to which the provisions
of clauses (ii)(A), (B) and (C) of this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of such a new notice, all
references to five (5) Business Days in this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ shall be
deemed to refer to be three (3) Business Days); (B) during such five (5)
Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of
Intended Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors and other Representatives to, negotiate in good
faith with Parent (if Parent has requested that they negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent
proposes to make; and (C) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period and
taking into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and that such Takeover Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal; or

 



38 (ii) other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the Companys
Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening
Event, if and only if: (A) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) the
Company then provides written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Intended
Intervening Event_ ") that the Company intends to take such action and
describing the Company Intervening Event that is the basis for such action in
reasonable detail (it being understood that such Notice of Intended
Intervening Event shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change); (C) during the five (5) Business Day period following
Parents receipt of the Notice of Intended Intervening Event, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors and other
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent (if Parent has requested that they
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Company Intervening Event would no longer necessitate
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (D) following the end of such
five (5) Business Day period, the Companys Board of Directors shall then have
determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and
irrevocable offer in response to the Notice of Intended Intervening Event,
that the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Company Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable
Law, (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained
in this _Section 5.3_ or (iv) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
stockholders of the Company). No disclosures under this _Section 5.3(e)_
shall be, in themselves, a breach of _Section 5.3_ or a basis for Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
Affiliates thereof) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly,
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (i) assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but
excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) that account for
20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or from which 20% or more of
the Companys revenues or

 



39  earnings on a consolidated basis are derived or (ii) 20% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale or issuance of shares of capital stock, tender
offer, share exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company, in each case other than the Merger.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
unsolicited written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, to be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company
from a financial point of view than the Transaction (taking into account any
modifications to the terms thereof as may be proposed by Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.3(d)(i)_), taking into account, to the extent applicable, the
identity of the Person making such proposal and the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and the Transaction
that the Company Board determines to be relevant; _provided_ that for purposes
of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary, or any director or
officer of the Company or any Subsidiary, takes any action which, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.3_.

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as
practicable, (ii) make promptly any required submissions and filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws or to Governmental Authorities with respect to the
Transactions, (iii) promptly furnish information required in connection with
such submissions and filing to such Governmental Authorities or under such
Antitrust Laws, (iv) keep the other parties reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any such submissions and filings to such Governmental
Authorities or under Antitrust Laws, including with respect to (A) the receipt
of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the
expiration of any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws
and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or
threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws with
respect to the Transactions and (v) obtain all actions or non-actions,
approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. For purposes hereof, "
_Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, all applicable foreign Antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

 



40 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree
to a different date), (B) supply as soon as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,

agrees to (A) make or cause to be made the appropriate filings under any
foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (B) supply as soon as practical any additional information and
documentary material that may be required or requested by any Governmental
Authority or in connection with any foreign Antitrust Laws and (C) use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ as necessary to obtain any necessary
approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other actions or non-
actions from each Governmental Authority or in connection with any
foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information: (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of (and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies
of) any communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority regarding
the filings and submissions described in  _Section 5.4(a)_ and permit the
others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written response to
any communication from a Governmental Authority regarding the filings and
submissions described in _Section 5.4(a)_, (ii) keep the others reasonably
informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the
Transactions and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or
discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without giving the
other party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may designate any
competitively sensitive non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing the
non-public information. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy relating to Antitrust Laws.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or
resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,
approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws that may
be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties to
close the Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date), including committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i)
the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of assets or
businesses of Parent or Company or any of their respective

 



41  Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or waiving
existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii)
creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Parent or Company or their respective Subsidiaries (each a "
_Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Remedial Action may,
unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by Company and Parent, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective Affiliates to,
acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration
or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws with
respect to the Transactions, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or delay obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other applicable laws with
respect to the Transactions.

 

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced or threatened by any Governmental Authority challenging any of the
Transactions and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts, including agreeing to or taking a Remedial Action (subject to the
proviso set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_), to avoid or resolve any such
litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest, defend and resist any such litigation, action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any ruling,
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays, interferes
with or restricts consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date.

(g) The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall notify the Company, promptly of (i) the receipt of any written notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other communication
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and (iii)
any legal actions commenced, or to such partys Knowledge, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the JV or Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the Transactions. In no event
shall (x) the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this  _Section
5.4_ limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (y)
disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to amend or supplement the
Company Disclosure Schedules or constitute an exception to any representation
or warranty.

 



42 Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be a joint press release mutually agreed to by the parties and
thereafter (unless and until a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred pursuant to  _Section 5.3(d)_) the Company and Parent shall not
issue any press releases or otherwise make public announcements with respect
to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement is reasonably determined to be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Authority (and then only after as much advance notice and
consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.5_ shall not apply to any release or public
statement (a) made or proposed to be made by any party to this Agreement in
connection with a Company Intervening Event, a Takeover Proposal, a Superior
Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken
pursuant thereto, (b) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the Transaction or (c) that is not inconsistent in
any material respects with and does not include material information not
previously set forth in the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.

 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, from the date hereof until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the JV to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice to the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives, offices, plants, properties (but excluding for the conduct of
Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments or sampling or testing), books,
Contracts and records and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning its business and
properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the other party;
_provided_ , _further_ , (i) that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information and (ii) the
conduct of such activities shall be subject to the rights and obligations of
the Company referred to in the final proviso of the penultimate sentence of
_Section 5.4(c)_. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be
subject to the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of
April 30, 2016, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall not, and Parent and
the Company shall cause their respective Representatives not to, use such
information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Statute is or is reasonably
likely to become applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



43 Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has at any time prior to the Effective Time been, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, suit, action, audit, review, hearing, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) honor all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of
liability, exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as
provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the respective
organizational documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries as currently in
effect and (B) any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee, which shall
in each case survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions
for limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no less favorable
to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter Documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees during such six (6) year period except as
required by applicable Law.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay and advance to an Indemnitee any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 5.8_ or
the enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this  _Section 5.8_ as and
when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification for such
matter (but only to the extent such repayment is required by applicable Law,
the Company Charter Documents, applicable organizational documents
of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable indemnification agreements). Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnitees
conduct complies with an

 



44  applicable standard under applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents,
applicable organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company, or
applicable indemnification agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable
to Parent. The provisions of _Section 5.8(a)_ and _Section 5.8(b)_ to the
contrary notwithstanding, neither the Surviving Corporation, any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent shall be liable for indemnification under this _Section
5.8_ for any settlement or consent decree effected without its prior written
consent following the Effective Time, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any Indemnitee wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.8_ shall promptly notify Parent and the
Surviving Corporation upon learning of any such Claim (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under
this _Section 5.8_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries), and shall keep the
Surviving Corporation regularly informed over the status of such Claim.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time either through the
Companys existing insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Effective Time,
Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company in respect of the coverages
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may
purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate
amount which Parent would be required to spend during the sixyear period
provided for in this _Section 5.8(c)_, that provides coverage not materially
less favorable than the coverage described above to the insured persons than
the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives from and after the Effective Time and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this  _Section 5.8_
applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees
to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_).

 

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify the
other parties of the commencement of any stockholder litigation against the
Company or any of its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions of which it has received notice or which, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is threatened (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent
reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. The

 



45  Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation. Without
limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any such Transaction Litigation, and the right to
consult on the settlement with respect to such Transaction Litigation, and
the Company will in good faith take such comments into account.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall
not settle or enter into any settlement of any such litigation without the
prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that any request for such consent
shall be considered by Parent reasonably and in good faith.

 

Section 5.10 _Section 16_. Promptly after the date hereof and prior to the
Expiration Date, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of Shares resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the period lasting until December 31, 2017 (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ "), (i) annual base
salary or base wage and target annual cash bonus opportunity that, in each
case, is no less favorable in the aggregate than the annual base salary or
base wage and target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (other than under equity plans and arrangements) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the level of employee benefits (other than under
equity plans and arrangements) provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
any Company Employee whose employment terminates following the Effective Time
and during the Continuation Period with, if applicable, notice, termination or
severance compensation and benefits no less favorable than those that would
have been provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including pursuant to the existing terms of the applicable Company Plan in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or as is required pursuant to
any employment agreement or other agreement in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Company Plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately 

 



46  prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) Parent shall ensure that each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions to
provide for full vesting of all amounts credited to the account of each
Company Employee under the Companys 401(k) plan.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.11(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company Plans existing and
applicable to such entity as of immediately before the Effective Time in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time and the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control",
"change of control", "corporate transaction" or other similar words to such
effect under such Company Plans.

(e) To the extent that the Effective Time occurs (i) in 2016 or (ii) following
the end of the 2016 performance period with respect to the Annual Incentive
Plan or any other applicable annual bonus plan, but, in each case, prior to
payment of the bonuses for such 2016 performance period, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee the greater of (x)
the Company Employees target bonus for such 2016 performance period and (y)
the bonus to which the Company Employee would be entitled for such 2016
performance period based on actual performance (each, a " _2016 Bonus_ ").
Payment of any such 2016 Bonus will be contingent on the applicable Company
Employees continued employment through the end of the performance period;
_provided_ , that in the event that a Company Employees employment is
terminated without Cause or if such Company Employee resigns with Good Reason
prior to the end of such performance period, such Company Employee will be
entitled to a pro rata 2016 Bonus, calculated on the basis of the number of
days such Company Employee was employed during 2016, divided by 365. For
purposes herein, "Cause" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings set forth
in any employment agreement or other agreement 

 



47  providing the relevant Company Employee with termination entitlements or
severance, and, if no such agreement exists, "Cause" shall be defined as (i)
the willful and continued failure by a Company Employee to substantially
perform his or her duties with the Company that has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after written demand for substantial performance is delivered
by the Company, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the
Company Employee has not substantially performed (other than any such failure
resulting from the Company Employees incapacity due to physical or mental
illness); (ii) the willful engaging by a Company Employee in conduct which is
demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise;
or (iii) the engaging by a Company Employee in egregious misconduct involving
serious moral turpitude, and "Good Reason" shall be defined as the occurrence
of any of the following without the affected Company Employees written
consent: (i) a reduction by the Company in the Company Employees annual
salary or, if applicable, bonus opportunity; or (ii) the relocation of the
Company Employees principal place of employment to a location more than fifty
(50) miles from the Company Employees principal place of employment or the
Companys requiring the Company Employee to be based anywhere other than such
principal place of employment (or permitted relocation thereof) except for
required travel on the Companys business to an extent substantially
consistent with the Company Employees business travel obligations. In
addition, in the event that the Effective Time occurs in 2017, at the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
Company Employee a pro-rata portion of any bonus that such Company Employee
would have been entitled to receive under the Annual Incentive Plan and any
other applicable annual bonus plan for the 2017 performance period based on
the Company Employees target bonus for such 2017 performance period.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 5.11_, express or implied, shall confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Section 5.11_ and no Company Employee or other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 5.11_, including with respect to (i) obligating
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A) maintain any particular benefit
plan or arrangement or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee,
(ii) preventing Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any benefit plan or arrangement or (iii) altering any at-will
employment relationship of any Company Employee or constituting a guarantee of
continued employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Agreement express or implied, shall be construed to constitute the
establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Company Plans.

 

Section 5.12 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform promptly their respective
obligations under this Agreement and, without limitation, to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity of any nature
except for activities related to or in furtherance of the Transactions.

Section 5.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 



48 Section 5.14 _NASDAQ Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and the rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the
NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

 _TERMINATION_



 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or

 

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Acceptance Time shall not have been consummated on or before
January 31, 2017 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to
any party whose breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement has been the principal cause of the failure of the Acceptance Time
to have occurred on or before the End Date; or

(ii) if any Law having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ or clause
2(e) of Annex I shall not have been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside,
annulled or

 



49  suspended and shall be in full force and effect and, in the case of any
ruling, decree, judgment, injunction or order of any Governmental Authority
(each, a " _Restraint_ "), shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of
such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to a breach by such
party of any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, including
pursuant to _Section 5.4_; or

 

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of any of the
conditions set forth in clauses 2(a) or (b) of _Annex I_ to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this  _Section 7.1(c)(i)_, if
such a breach is curable by the Company within the earlier of the End Date and
thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach
and the Company is continuing to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured
upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ if either
Parent or Merger Sub is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement
such that the Company would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_; or

 

(ii) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, if such a
breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub within the earlier of the End Date
and thirty (30) days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such
breach and Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, is continuing to use its
reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the earlier of the End
Date and the expiration of such thirty (30) day period; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_; or

 

(ii) if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with, and in
compliance with the applicable requirements of, _Section 5.3_ and shall have
approved, and substantially concurrently with the termination hereunder, the
Company shall have entered into, a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal and paid (or caused to be paid) the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_;.

 



50 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and have no further force or effect (other than _Section
1.1(g)_, _Section 3.24_, _Section 4.9_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_,
and _Article VIII_ , all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or their respective directors, officers, other Representatives
or Affiliates, whether arising before or after such termination, based on,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,
performance or subject matter hereof (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in
equity); _provided_ , _ however_ , that, subject to _Section 7.3_ (including
the limitations on liability contained therein), no party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any willful and
material breach of any representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or any material breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement,
in each case, that occurred prior to such termination and that gave rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in  _Article VI_. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms following termination of
this Agreement. Without limiting the meaning of a material breach, the parties
acknowledge and agree that any failure by a party hereto to accept shares in
the Offer or consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby
after the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have
been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall
constitute a material breach of a covenant set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid as directed
by Parent the Company Termination Fee substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement if Parent shall have provided wiring
instructions for payment of the Company Termination Fee as of such termination
or, if Parent has not then provided such wiring instructions, then such
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made promptly following
delivery of such wiring instructions by Parent (even if after such
termination).

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid as directed
by Parent the Company Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such
termination.

(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_
(solely with respect to a breach or failure to perform a covenant), (ii) (A)
in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_, a Takeover
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or made to the Company after the
date hereof and not publicly withdrawn prior to the date of the Companys
covenant breach that forms

 



51  the basis of Parents termination (as specified in the written notice
delivered by Parent to the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_) or (B) in
the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_, a Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed after the date hereof and not publicly
withdrawn prior to the date of termination, and (iii) within twelve (12)
months of the date this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a
Company Acquisition Agreement which is subsequently consummated or consummates
a Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of clause (iii) of this
_Section 7.3(c)_, the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay or cause to be paid as directed by Parent the Company Termination Fee on
the date of consummation of such transaction.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean
an amount equal to $24,300,000.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or
willful and material breach of _Section 5.3_, the parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated
to pay the Company Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_ and the Company
Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions, and, upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, the Company (and the
Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and other Representatives) shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives.

 

(f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 7.3_ shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, less any required withholding Taxes.

(g) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

pursue damages in the event of Parent or Merger Subs breach of this

and on behalf of its stockholders (without duplication) shall be determined by
reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable by the holders
of the Company Common Stock (including, "lost premium" and time value of
money) if all such holders brought an action against Parent and Merger Sub and
were recognized as intended third party beneficiaries hereunder, which right
is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) the

Section 8.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) agrees
that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (
_provided_ that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in
or declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims shall be brought,
heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein in any other court and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any suit, action or proceeding so brought.

territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 8.8_ in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article VIII_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

Section 8.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party
seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this
Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the

 



54  necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy (and each
party hereby agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to the Laws of any jurisdiction (including
the State of Japan) or inequitable), and the parties further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. If any party hereto brings any Claim to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by the period of time between the commencement
of such Claim and ten (10) Business Days following the date on which such
Claim is fully and finally resolved.

Section 8.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES

BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.10_.

 _CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_

 

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this _Annex I_ is attached (the "
_Agreement_ "), Merger Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment, and,
subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-l(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall not be obligated to pay for, or
may delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any validly tendered
Shares pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for), if immediately prior to the Expiration Date, there shall not have
been validly tendered (not including as tendered those Shares that are
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures but not actually delivered
prior to the Expiration Date) and not validly withdrawn that number of Shares
that when added to the Shares then owned by Merger Sub would represent one
Share more than 50% of the sum of:

(a) all Shares then actually outstanding, and

(b) all Shares that the Company may be required to issue prior to the End Date
upon the vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of
the Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding
warrants, options, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into
Shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued Shares (including all then
outstanding Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company
RSUs), regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and
conditions thereof (such condition in this clause (1) being, the " _Minimum
Condition_ ").

(2) Notwithstanding any other term or provision of the Offer or the
Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment, and,
subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-l(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall not be obligated to pay for, or may
delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any validly tendered
Shares pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for), if at the Expiration Date any of the following conditions shall not be
satisfied or have been waived: 

(a) (i) Each of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_, _Section 3.2(a)_, _Section 3.2(b)_, _Section
3.3(a)_, _Section 3.6(b)(i)_, and _Section 3.20)_ shall be true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), except where the failure to be
true and correct has not had or would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) each of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
3.1(a)_, _Section 3.3(a)_, and _Section 3.20_ shall be true and correct in
all material respects; (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company

aggregate amount of consideration payable by Parent and Merger Sub in the
Offer and the Merger) and (iv) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in 

 



Annex I-1   _Section 3.6(b)(i)_ shall be true and correct in all respects; in the case
of each of clause (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), as of the Expiration Date as
though made at and as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent that such
representation and warranty is expressly made as of a specified date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
specific date), and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect;

(b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all covenants
and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior
to the Expiration Date, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect;

(c) The waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to
the Transactions under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have
expired and necessary consents thereunder, if required, shall have been
received;

 

(d) Since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) No Law enacted, promulgated, issued, entered or enforced by any
Governmental Authority shall be in effect enjoining, restraining, preventing
or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger or making the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal; and

 

(f) The Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_.

 

The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Condition and the condition
relating to the valid termination of the Agreement, are for the sole benefit
of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent
