ii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of November
16, 2006, among JOHNSON and JOHNSON, a New Jersey corporation ("Parent"),
CYPRESS ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and CONOR MEDSYSTEMS, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has approved and
declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, this
Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby
each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company and (ii) the
Appraisal Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash;
and

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in
accordance with the DGCL.

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide
Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date
or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by law) waived on such second business day, then the
Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law)
waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Closing Date".

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company
Certificate") shall be amended at the Effective Time as set forth in Exhibit A
and, as so amended, such Company Certificate shall be the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

(b) The Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



 

2 ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

(a)  _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. As provided in Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax
law.

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to



 

3 receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint JPMorgan Chase or another comparable bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
which shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying
Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such



 

4 payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.
No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Paying Agent for any reason, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash
to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II.

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such



 

5 person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties_

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._  Except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the particular
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in
such disclosure schedule relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any information set forth in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof
to which its relevance is readily apparent on its face) delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub
as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good
standing (in the jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the
case may be, and has all requisite power and authority and possesses all
governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise
hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing, have such power
or authority or possess such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations or
approvals individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the



 

6 concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement, complete and accurate copies
of the Company Certificate and its Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Company
Bylaws"), and the comparable organizational documents of each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date hereof. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and accurate copies of the minutes (or, in the
case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of all
meetings of the stockholders of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the
Boards of Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the
committees of each of such Boards of Directors, in each case held since
January 1, 2003 and prior to the date hereof.

(b) _Subsidiaries._  Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
as of the date hereof each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each
such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and, as of the
date hereof, each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is qualified or
licensed to do business. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (other
than liens, charges and encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due and
payable) (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
interests. Except for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity
interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity
interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or
other entity.

(c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). At
the close of business on November 14, 2006, (i) 37,719,021 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including 168,657 Company
Restricted Shares), (ii) 0 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company in its treasury, (iii) 9,097,724 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 1999 Stock Plan of the
Company, the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan of the Company, the 2004 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan of the Company and the 2004 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan of the Company (the "ESPP", and such plans, collectively, the
"Company Stock Plans"), of which 7,215,432 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to outstanding Company Stock Options and (iv) no shares of



 

7 Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or were held by the Company
as treasury shares. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c), at the
close of business on November 14, 2006, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on
transfer imposed by the Company, stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock
rights, performance units, rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock
on a deferred basis or other rights (other than Company Stock Options and the
Company Restricted Shares) that are linked to the value of Company Common
Stock (collectively, but exclusive of rights under the ESPP, "Company Stock-
Based Awards"). Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and accurate list, as of November 15, 2006, of (A) all outstanding
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, together
with any options granted after November 15, 2006, as expressly permitted by
this Agreement, but exclusive of rights under the ESPP, "Company Stock
Options") under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (or other stock) subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, exercise or base prices (if applicable) and vesting
schedules thereof and the names of the holders thereof and (B) all shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding as of the relevant time but
were subject to vesting or other forfeiture restrictions or were subject to a
right of repurchase by the Company at a fixed purchase price as of such time
(shares so subject, the "Company Restricted Shares") under the Company Stock
Plans or otherwise, the grant and issuance dates, vesting schedules and
repurchase price (if any) thereof and the names of the holders thereof. All
(i) Company Restricted Shares and (ii) Company Stock Options are evidenced by
stock option agreements, restricted stock purchase agreements or other award
agreements, in each case substantially in the forms set forth in Section
3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, except that (A) the forms of such
agreements differ with respect to the number of options or shares covered
thereby, the exercise price, regular vesting schedule, repurchase price and
expiration date applicable thereto and other similar terms; and (B) outside
the United States, the forms of such agreements have been modified solely to
the extent necessary to comply with Legal Provisions and, except as provided
in the preceding clauses (A) and (B), no stock option agreement, restricted
stock purchase agreement or other award agreement contains terms that are
inconsistent in any material respect with, or material terms in addition to,
such forms. Each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later
than the date on which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its
terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of the Company
(or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required
stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, and
the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and
delivered by each party thereto, each such grant was made in accordance with
the terms of the applicable



 

8 compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act and all
other applicable laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the
rules of the Nasdaq Global Market, the per share exercise price of each
Company Stock Option was equal to the fair market value (as such term is
defined in the Company Stock Plans other than the ESPP) of a share of Company
Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and each such grant was properly
accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including
the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The Company
has not knowingly granted, and there is no and has been no Company policy or
practice to knowingly grant, Company Stock Options prior to, or otherwise
knowingly coordinate the grant of Company Stock Options with, the release or
other public announcement of material information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their financial results or prospects. Each Company Stock
Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Code so qualifies. As of the close of business on November 14, 2006,
there were outstanding Company Stock Options to purchase 7,215,432 shares of
Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the
Merger Consideration, and the weighted average exercise price of such Company
Stock Options was equal to $10.61. 28,155 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to outstanding rights under the ESPP based on payroll information for
the period ending November 15, 2006 (assuming the fair market value per share
of Company Common Stock determined in accordance with the terms of the ESPP on
the last day of the offering period in effect under the ESPP on the date
hereof was equal to the Merger Consideration and that payroll deductions
continue at the current rate). Each Company Stock Option and each Company
Restricted Share may, by its terms, be treated at the Effective Time as
set forth in Section 5.04(a)(i) or 5.04(a)(ii), as applicable. All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares which
may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Options or rights under the ESPP
will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive
rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c) and
for shares issued or to be issued upon the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding on the date hereof and included in clause (iii) of the first
sentence of this Section 3.01(c), as of the date hereof, (x) there are not
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock
or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company, (B) any
securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the
Company or (C) any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities,
equity interests or



 

9 securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock
or voting securities of the Company and (y) there are not any outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the
voting of any such securities. Except as set forth above in this Section
3.01(c), as of the date hereof, there are no outstanding (1) securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities or equity
interests of any Subsidiary of the Company, (2) warrants, calls, options or
other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital

respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities
Act"), the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including

Document has been revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-
filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact

Subsidiaries



 

12 as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and

statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents"), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which individually
or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is, or has at

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to

for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (B) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, (C) that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and

could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.

(iv) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of the Company are designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.



 

13 (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined

statements or other Company SEC Documents.

(vi) Since December 10, 2004, the Company has not received any oral or
written notification of any "material weakness" in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. There is no outstanding "significant
deficiency" or "material weakness" which the Companys independent
accountants certify has not been appropriately and adequately remedied by the
Company, other than, in the case of any "significant deficiencies",
individually or in the aggregate as have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the
meanings assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof.

(f)  _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is

in each case providing benefits to any Participant, but not including any
Company Benefit Agreement (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"), or any
material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding
obligations with respect to any Company Pension Plans, or any change in the
manner in which contributions to any Company Pension Plans are made or the
basis on which such contributions are determined, other than amendments or
other changes as required to ensure that such Company Pension Plan is not

determined by the Company to be necessary or appropriate to preserve the
qualified status of a Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents, as of the date hereof,
there exist no currently binding material Company Benefit Agreements other
than any such agreements that provide for employment on an "at will" basis.
As of the



 

19 date hereof, there are no collective bargaining or other labor union

represented by any union with respect to their employment by the Company or
such Subsidiary. As of the date hereof, since December 10, 2004, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any labor disputes, union
organization attempts or work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts due to labor
disagreements.

(l) _ERISA Compliance._ (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure

Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) (sometimes referred to herein as a "Company

benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company

Company Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit
Plans or Company Benefit Agreements, written descriptions thereof), (B) the
two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Company Benefit Plan
(if any such report was required under applicable law), (C) the most recent
summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary
plan description is required under applicable law and (D) each trust agreement
and insurance or group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan

been administered in all respects in accordance with its terms and (B) the
Company, its Subsidiaries and all the Company Benefit Plans are all in
compliance in all respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
and all other applicable laws, including laws of foreign jurisdictions, and
the terms of all collective bargaining agreements.

(ii) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have received
favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to all tax law
changes with respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a
determination letter, to the effect that such Company Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened)
and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination
letter or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or

foreign Governmental Entity have been so approved, no such approval has been
revoked (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened)
and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would

each Company Pension Plan, as well as a complete and accurate copy of each
pending application for a determination letter, if any. The Company has also

any Company Pension Plan in effect as of the date hereof as to which a
favorable determination letter has not yet been received.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity (A) has
sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any
Company Benefit Plan in effect as of the date hereof that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or (B) has any
unsatisfied liability under Title IV of ERISA.

 

(iv) Except as individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all reports,
returns and similar documents with respect to all Company Benefit Plans
required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any
Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or
distributed. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice of, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by
any Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other
claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
Company Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan that would give rise to any liability (except claims for
benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plan) and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that could give rise to
any liability in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or
proceeding, in each case, except for liabilities that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have
been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC
Documents. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single employer plan of
any Commonly Controlled Entity has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived.



 

21 (vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, except as individually or in
the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (A) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or
other fiduciary of such Company Benefit Plan, or any agent of the foregoing,
has engaged that could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, a trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under any Company
Benefit Plan, to a tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or
any applicable law and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other
fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing,
has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a
manner, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary, to any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. During the last five years, no
Company Benefit Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor has there been
any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, and no notice of a reportable event will be required to
be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
whether each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is
an employee welfare benefit plan is (A) unfunded or self-insured, (B)
funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as such term is defined in Section
419(e) of the Code, or other funding mechanism, or (C) insured. Each such
employee welfare benefit plan may be amended or terminated (including with
respect to benefits provided to retirees and other former employees) without
material liability (other than benefits then payable under such plan without
regard to such amendment or termination) to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries complies in all respects with the applicable requirements of
Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA or any similar state
or local law with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health
plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state
or local law, except for instances of noncompliance that individually or in
the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company



 

22 nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material obligations for post-termination
health or life insurance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement (other than for continuation coverage required under Section
4980B(f) of the Code and any similar state or local law).

(viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will, except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (A) entitle any Participant to
severance, termination, retention, change in control or similar compensation
or benefits, except as required by any Legal Provisions, (B) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any breach
or violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement. The total amount of all payments and the fair market value
of all non-cash benefits (other than Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Shares) that may become payable or provided to Participants under
the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements (assuming for such
purpose that such individuals employment were terminated immediately
following the Effective Time as if the Effective Time were the date
hereof) will not exceed the aggregate amount set forth in Section
3.01(l)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(ix) No persons engaged to provide services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as consultants or independent contractors could reasonably be
deemed to be misclassified employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(x) No deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any
"applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code. 

(xi) Each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code (a "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") subject
to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in compliance with Section 409A
of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable
interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the Code and (B)(1) the Proposed
Regulations issued thereunder or (2) IRS Notice 2005-1, in each case as
modified by IRS Notice 2006-79 (clauses (A) and (B), together, the "409A
Authorities"). No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that would
be a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan subject to Section



 

23 409A of the Code but for the effective date provisions that are applicable to
Section 409A of the Code, as set forth in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004, as amended (the "AJCA"), has been "materially modified"
within the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3,
2004, based upon a good faith reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the
409A Authorities. No Participant is entitled to any gross-up, make-whole or
other additional payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of any tax (including Federal, state, local or foreign income, excise
or other taxes (including taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code)) or
interest or penalty related thereto.

(m) _No Excess Parachute Payments._ Other than payments or benefits that may
be made to the persons listed in Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule ("Primary Company Executives"), no amount or other entitlement or
economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event, including as a result of termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the benefit of any
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Benefit Agreement or otherwise would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no
disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment from
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other person in the event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of
the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual (a "Parachute Gross Up
Payment"). Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth,
calculated as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the "base amount" (as such
term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary Company
Executive and each other disqualified individual (defined as set forth above)
who holds any Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares that will
vest in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with
any other event, including as a result of any termination of employment on or
following the Effective Time) and (ii) the estimated maximum amount of
"parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code that could be paid
or provided to each Primary Company Executive as a result of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this

under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon, any Intellectual
Property Right that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as presently conducted.

such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly provide the other with copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the
portions of such filings that include confidential information not directly
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Certain Tax Matters._ (i) During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file
all tax returns ("Post-Signing Returns") required to be filed by or on behalf
of each such entity; (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to timely pay all
taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns that are so
filed; (C) use commercially reasonable efforts to accrue a reserve in the
books and records and financial statements of any such entity at such times
and in such amounts as are in accordance with past practice for all taxes
payable by such entity for which no Post-Signing Return is due prior to
the Effective Time; (D) promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or



 

43 audit (collectively, "Actions") that is or becomes pending against or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material
amount of tax and not settle or compromise any such Action without Parents
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (E) not
make or change any material tax election or settle or compromise any material
tax liability, other than with Parents consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) or other than in the ordinary course of
business; and (F) cause all existing tax sharing agreements, tax indemnity
obligations and similar agreements, arrangements or practices other than
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ("Tax-Related Agreements") with respect to taxes to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may otherwise be bound (other than
Tax-Related Agreements between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
be terminated as of the Closing Date so that after such date neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder.

(ii) The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a
certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that the payment of the Merger Consideration and any
payments made in respect of the Appraisal Shares pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement are exempt from withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment
in Real Property Tax Act.

(iii) To the extent Section 6043A of the Code applies to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties shall cooperate with each other
and provide each other with all information as is reasonably necessary for the
parties to satisfy the reporting obligations under Section 6043A of the Code.

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or
which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and (B)
promptly after the date hereof request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such person(s) within the
last 12 months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Takeover Proposal.



 

44 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal by such party, and which Takeover Proposal was
not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may,
if its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and
subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (which need not restrict such person from making an unsolicited
Takeover Proposal) not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that all such information has previously
been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. 

The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets (including for the purpose of this definition the
outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company)
or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more
of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person
or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company
or businesses or assets that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net
income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third party
that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all
or substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i)
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than



 

45 the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or
any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an "Acquisition
Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company may: (x) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable law, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) in
response to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited after the date
hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with or after such
termination, cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (1) no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
4.02(b) may be made, in each case until after the fourth business day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent
that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed
action by the Board of Directors is a Superior Proposal, the terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new four business day period). In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice
of Adverse Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.



 

46 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The
Company shall (i) keep Parent informed of the status and material terms and
conditions (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such
Takeover Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material (including draft agreements) relating to any such
Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
their Representatives), on the one hand, and the person making a Takeover
Proposal (or its Representatives), on the other hand.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
making a statement required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (y) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law, including the Board of
Directors duty of candor to the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by Section 4.02(b) (it being understood that any accurate disclosure of
factual information to the stockholders of the Company that is required to be
made to such stockholders under applicable federal securities laws or other
Legal Provisions shall not be considered a modification prohibited by Section
4.02(b)).

ARTICLE V

_Additional Agreements_

SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting._
(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of
the Company as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the



 

47 Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent; provided that Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided its
comments to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
document or response is transmitted to Parent for its review. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, (or, with respect to calling, giving notice of, convening and
holding a meeting of its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a)
under the Exchange Act or the resolution of any comments from the SEC),
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") solely for the
purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Subject to Sections
4.02(b) and 4.02(d), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and except as otherwise contemplated by Sections 4.02(b) and
7.01(f), the Companys obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof of such Board of Directors or such
committees approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for
the purpose of coordinating integration activities and transition planning
with the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior
to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, personnel and



 

48 records but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to
Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it after the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, other than any such
report, schedule, registration statement or other document that is available
in unredacted form on EDGAR, (b) a copy of each correspondence or written
communication, other than immaterial correspondence and written
communication, with any United States Federal or state Governmental Entity and
(c) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to) so confer, afford such access or furnish such copies or other
information to the extent that doing so would result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). In addition, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain when available
consistent with past practice all unblinded clinical trial data with respect
to the Companys COSTAR II clinical trial, and the Company shall furnish all
such data to Parent promptly upon receipt. Except for disclosures expressly
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 11, 2006,
as amended from time to time, between Parent and the Company (as it may be
amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent shall
hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information received from the
Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and shall otherwise comply with the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to such information. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant
to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity and (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; provided
that none of the Company, Parent or Sub shall be required to make any payment
to any such third parties



 

49 or concede anything of value to obtain such consents. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing: (A) the Company and Parent shall duly file
with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing")
required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any similar filings in other jurisdictions that counsel for
Parent reasonably deems necessary, in each case within 45 days after the date
of this Agreement, and (B) Parent shall vigorously defend against any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings by any Governmental Entity challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger. The HSR Filing shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party
shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the
other party in the preparation of its HSR Filing, to request early termination
of the waiting period required by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly
amend or furnish additional information thereunder. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with a Request for
Additional Information pursuant to 15 USC Section 18a(e)(1). Each party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and
notice, other than confidential or proprietary information not directly
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to keep the
other party reasonably informed with respect to the status of each clearance,
approval or waiver sought from a Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the material
communications between such party and such Governmental Entity. Each party
shall consult with the other party, and consider in good faith the views of
the other party, prior to entering into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity charged with enforcing the relevant jurisdictions antitrust or
competition laws. The Company and its Board of Directors shall (1) use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2)
if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to
agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of
any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.04.  _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares; ESPP._ (a)
As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following:



 

50 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options, whether vested
or unvested, as necessary to provide that the Company Stock Options will
become fully exercisable and may be exercised before the Effective Time at
such applicable time or times as specified in the Company Stock Plans, and, at
the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall then
become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, a
single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not
theretofore have been exercised and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option;

(ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares as
necessary to provide that each Company Restricted Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c); and

(iii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the Company and
Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company administering the ESPP), shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to
the ESPP (i) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately
prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs; provided that all
amounts allocated to each participants account under the ESPP as of such date
shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company
Common Stock at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP
for the then outstanding offering periods using such date as the final
purchase date for each such offering period, and (iii) the ESPP shall
terminate immediately following such purchases of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 5.04(a) and 5.04(b) shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid
without interest as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

(d) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder
of a Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or Company Stock-Based
Award (or former holder of a Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or
Company Stock-Based Award) or any current or former participant in any Company
Stock Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any
right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other equity interest therein
(including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).



 

51 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and
Insurance._ (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the
obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors or
officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof or as
amended or entered into prior to the Closing with the consent of Parent),
without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys a material portion of its properties and other
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.05 or Parent shall take such other action to ensure that the ability of the
Surviving Corporation, legal and financial, to satisfy such obligations will
not be diminished.

(c) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail")
directors and officers liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the
Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(c), Parent shall not be
obligated to pay more than $1,500,000 in the aggregate to obtain such
coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot
be obtained for $1,500,000 or less in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated
to obtain a prepaid policy providing such coverage as may be obtained for
such $1,500,000 aggregate amount.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of
this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.



 

52 (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(e) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (ii) (A)
after the date hereof and prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval,
a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the
Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and
whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) (but only if a vote to obtain the Stockholder Approval or the
Stockholders Meeting has not been held) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$46,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds on the
first business day following (x) in the case of a payment required by clause
(i) above, the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a
payment required by clause (ii) above, the date of the first to occur of the
events referred to in clause (ii)(C). For purposes of clause (ii)(C) of the
immediately preceding sentence only, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 4.02(a) except that all
references to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "35%."

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ Except (a) with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (b) with respect to disclosures that are consistent with prior
disclosures made in compliance with this Section 5.07, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or



 

53 national securities quotation system. The parties agree that all formal
Company employee communication programs or announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms mutually
agreed to by the parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (it being understood, however, that no further mutual agreement
shall be required with respect to any such programs or announcements that are
consistent with prior programs or announcements made in compliance with this
Section 5.07). The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

SECTION 5.08.  _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of not less than six
months following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries employed primarily in the United States who remain in the
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing
Employees") shall receive employee benefits that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or
arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants,
options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares
of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable
into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; _provided_
_further_ , that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in
determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable in the
aggregate.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with
Parent (i) for purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parents
defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation
under Parents vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility
and participation under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent
(other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan) and
(iv) unless covered under another arrangement with or of the Company, for
benefit accrual purposes under Parents severance plan (in the case of each
of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent that Parent makes
such plan or program available to employees of the Surviving Corporation and
not in any case where credit would result in duplication of benefits), but
not for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of Parent.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the



 

54 Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Company to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs,
policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Company. Without limiting the scope of Section 8.07, nothing
in this Section 5.09 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or
description upon any Continuing Employee or any other person other than
Parent, the Company and their respective successors and assigns.

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying
any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent
applicable under any such plan.

(e) With respect to the employees of the Company who are employed primarily
outside the United States, following the Effective Time, Parent and
its Subsidiaries will provide such employees with employee benefits in
accordance with applicable law.

SECTION 5.10. _Certain Other Actions._ The Company shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to accomplish the items set forth in Section 5.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

57 (b) by either Parent or the Company:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May 16, 2007

terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available
to any party whose breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement or

forth in Section 6.01(b) and/or 6.01(c) and/or 6.01(d) and/or 6.02(c) and/or

(iii) if a final vote of the stockholders of the Company has been taken and
the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Stockholders
Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(c) by Parent (i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within 45 calendar
days following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform

clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.02(c) shall be in effect and shall have
become final and nonappealable;

(d) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within 45 calendar days
following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
the Company;

(e) by Parent, in the event that prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder
Approval (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or

58 (f) by the Company in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company under this
Agreement, except that (a) the provisions of Section 3.01(s), the penultimate
sentence of Section 5.02, Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII,
shall survive such termination, and (b) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any willful and
material breach of any of its representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement or any material breach of any covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

SECTION 7.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval;  _provided_
, _however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made
no amendment that by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

SECTION 7.04. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time,

herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.03 and to the extent permitted by
law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

SECTION 7.05. _Procedure for Termination._ A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case
of the Company, action by its Board of Directors.

ARTICLE VIII

63 transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in
this Section 8.11.

SECTION 8.12.  _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

A-2 EXHIBIT A

TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT

_Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation_

_of the Surviving Corporation_

_FIRST_ : The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation")
is CONOR MEDSYSTEMS, INC.

_SECOND_ : The address, including street, number, city, and county, of the
registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is Corporate
Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, County of New
Castle; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State
of Delaware at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

_THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware.

_FOURTH_ : The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share.

_FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it
by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

_SIXTH_ : To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no
director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director or officer; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained in this Article SIXTH shall eliminate or limit the liability of a
director or officer (i) for any breach of the directors or officers duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or
officer derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of
this Article SIXTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability
or alleged liability of any director or officer of the Corporation for or
with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.

_SEVENTH_ : The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section
145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may
be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said
Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action
in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a
person. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely
affect any right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time of
such repeal or modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to
such repeal or modification.

The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any
director or officer within 15 days of the presentation of same to the
Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the
Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured undertaking to
repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation to advance
costs and expenses shall be mandatory, and not discretionary, and shall
include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in asserting
affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims. Such undertaking to
repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable director or
officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer, provided
that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party
making such undertaking.

_EIGHTH_ : Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation
shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.
