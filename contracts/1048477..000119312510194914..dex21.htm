(Recombinant GILT-tagged human acid alpha glucosidase, GILT-tagged GAA) has been designed to be an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease. The Bulk Drug Substance is a recombinant fusion protein containing the 61 amino acid
GILT (Glycosylation Independent Lysosomal Targeting) tag fused to amino acid residues 70-952 of human acid alpha glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme deficient in Pompe disease. The ZC-701 protein is purified from culture supernatants of a mammalian cell
line engineered to express the entire chimeric fusion protein as a single polypeptide. The expression cell line consists of a CHO-S cell transfected with a retrovector containing the DNA sequence for the chimeric ZC-701 gene containing both IGF-II
and GAA sequences. The amino acid sequence of ZC-701 plus the IGF-II signal peptide to enable secretion during cell culture production, is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the IGF-II derived signal peptide, which is removed prior to secretion of
the protein into culture media is italicized, the GILT tag is highlighted, and the three amino acid spacer separating the tag from GAA is underlined. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
