than the actual amount due by five percent (5%) or more, then the Purchaser
shall reimburse the Selling Holders for all fees and expenses incurred by the
Selling Holders in connection with such audit.

each of the Indemnitees from and against, and compensate and reimburse each of
the Indemnitees for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any of the
Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject

Section 9.3 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
but subject to Section 9.1(c), the Indemnitors shall not be liable under

unless and until the aggregate Damages for which they would otherwise be
liable under Section 9.2 exceed [****] individually or in the aggregate (the
" _Basket Amount_ "), in which case the Indemnitors shall be responsible only
for the amount of such Damages in excess of the Basket Amount. Except in the
case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and except as provided in the
last paragraph of Section 9.2, the Indemnitors shall not be liable under
Section 9.2 for any amounts in excess of the sum of the Holdback Amount and

to Section 9.2, the Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to
proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Selling Holders (it being understood
that fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with
such defense shall constitute Damages and shall be indemnified hereunder only
if an Indemnitor is obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Indemnitee with respect to such claim or Legal Proceeding
pursuant to Section 9.1). If the Purchaser so proceeds with the defense of any
such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of Article IX, all reasonable expenses
relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall constitute
Damages hereunder;

(b) each Indemnitor shall make available to the Purchaser any documents and
materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

 

(c) The Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Selling Holder
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

The Purchaser shall give the Selling Holders prompt notice of
the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against the Purchaser or the
Company; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of the Purchaser
to so notify the Selling Holders shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnitors under Section IX (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If the Purchaser does not
elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the
Selling Holders may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Selling Holders may not settle, adjust or compromise any
such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the
event the Purchaser has elected to proceed with the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Selling Holders may participate in, but not control,
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding at their own cost and with
counsel of their choosing.

and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. (e) If the Selling Holder Representative shall resign, die, become disabled or

herein to the Selling Holder Representative shall be deemed to refer to the
Selling Holders.

 

(f) The Selling Holder Representative shall incur no liability to the Selling
Holders with respect to any action taken or suffered by him in reliance upon
any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other documents

Selling Holder Representative may, in all questions arising under the Escrow

shall not be liable to the Selling Holders for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Selling Holder Representative based on such
advice. The parties hereto understand and agree that the Selling Holder
Representative is acting solely on behalf of and as agent for the Selling
Holders and not in his personal capacity, and in no event shall the Selling
Holder Representative be personally liable to the Selling Holders hereunder

on a pro rata basis based on the percentage of the aggregate Purchase Price
received by each Selling Holder pursuant to this Agreement, for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever, including all costs of defending any claim for indemnification
hereunder, which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Selling Holder Representative in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the performance of the obligations of the Selling
Holder Representative hereunder or under any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof; provided, however, that no
Selling Holder shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they
arise from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Selling Holder
Representative. The Selling Holder Representative shall be fully justified
in refusing to take or to continue to take any action hereunder unless he
shall first be fully indemnified to his reasonable satisfaction by the Selling
Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by him
by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. In addition to the
foregoing, the Selling Holder Representative shall be entitled to be

entitled to compensation, reimbursement or indemnification by the Selling
Holders pursuant to Section 10.1(g) (the " _Selling Holder Representative s
Fund_"). In addition, prior to the distribution of any Holdback Amount or
Contingent Payment to the Selling Holders, the Selling Holder may direct the
Purchaser that a portion of such distribution shall be paid to the Selling
Holder Representatives Fund to the extent that the Selling Holder
Representatives Fund Amount is insufficient to reimburse or indemnify the
Selling Holder Representative for any liability or expense incurred by the
Selling Holder Representative prior to such distribution. Any amounts paid
into the Selling Holder Representatives Fund shall not be in limitation of
the obligations of the Selling Holders pursuant to Section 10.1(g). The
deposit of the Selling Holder Representatives Fund Amount by Purchaser with
the Selling Holder Representative shall discharge Purchasers obligations
with respect to such amount, and Purchaser will not have any responsibility or
Liability for the manner in which the Selling Holder Representative
administers the Selling Holder Representatives Fund, or for causing or
ensuring that all or any portion of the Selling Holder Representatives Fund
Amount is ultimately paid or distributed to the Selling Holders. Upon the
determination of the Selling Holder Representative to release the Selling
Holder Representatives Fund Amount then remaining, if any, such remaining
Selling Holder Representatives Fund Amount shall be distributed to the
Selling Holders by the Selling Holder Representative in the same manner as
the Purchase Price is required to be paid to the Selling Holders in accordance
with Exhibit 1.4B.

DESCRIPTION OF ZC-701

ZC-701 (Recombinant GILT-tagged human acid alpha glucosidase, GILT-tagged
GAA) has been designed to be an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment
of Pompe disease. The Bulk Drug Substance is a recombinant fusion protein
containing the 61 amino acid GILT (Glycosylation Independent Lysosomal
Targeting) tag fused to amino acid residues 70-952 of human acid alpha
glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme deficient in Pompe disease. The ZC-701 protein
is purified from culture supernatants of a mammalian cell line engineered to
express the entire chimeric fusion protein as a single polypeptide. The
expression cell line consists of a CHO-S cell transfected with a retrovector
containing the DNA sequence for the chimeric ZC-701 gene containing both IGF-
II and GAA sequences. The amino acid sequence of ZC-701 plus the IGF-II
signal peptide to enable secretion during cell culture production, is shown in
Figure 1. In this figure, the IGF-II derived signal peptide, which is removed
prior to secretion of the protein into culture media is italicized, the GILT
tag is highlighted, and the three amino acid spacer separating the tag from
GAA is underlined.
