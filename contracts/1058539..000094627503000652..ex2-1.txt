(iii)      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of September  --------- 22, 2003, by and
among, CITIZENS BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank
(the "Buyer"), THISTLE GROUP HOLDINGS, CO., a unitary thrift  ----- holding
company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Seller"), 
------ and for the purpose of Article III and Section 6.15, CITIZENS
FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation and the parent company of the
Buyer (the "Parent").  ------ The capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Section 9.15 hereof.   WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the
Buyer and the Board of Directors of the Seller have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective stockholders and other constituencies,
as well as the communities they serve, to consummate, and have approved, the
business combination transactions provided for herein, in which, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, a subsidiary of the Buyer will
merge with and into the Seller;   WHEREAS, following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Buyer shall take such action as is
appropriate to form a subsidiary to be organized as a corporation (the
"Merger Sub") under the PBCL, and to cause the Merger Sub to become a party
to this Agreement, pursuant to which the Merger Sub ---------- shall merge
(the "Merger") with and into the Seller, upon the terms and subject 
------ to the conditions set forth herein (the Seller and the Merger Sub
being the constituent corporations of the Merger); and   WHEREAS, the
parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the
Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I - THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement,  ---------- in accordance with the PBCL, at the Effective
Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Seller. The Seller shall
be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving
Corporation") in the Merger, and  ---------------------- shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a
subsidiary of the Buyer. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall terminate.   1.2 Effective Time.
The Merger shall become effective when Articles of  -------------- Merger
(the "Articles of Merger"), executed in accordance with the relevant 
------------------- provisions of the PBCL, are filed    with the
Pennsylvania Department; provided, however, that upon the mutual written
consent of each of the Buyer and the Seller, the Articles of Merger
may provide for a later time or date of effectiveness of the Merger not more
than thirty (30) days after the date the Articles of Merger are filed with
the Pennsylvania Department. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective
Time" shall mean the date and time at which the Articles of Merger are filed
with the Pennsylvania Department or such later date and time established in
the Articles of Merger. The filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Pennsylvania Department shall be made on the Closing Date.   1.3 Effects of
the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger 
--------------------- shall have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the
PBCL.   1.4 Conversion of Seller Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue  --------------------------------- of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Merger Sub, the Seller, or the holder of any of the
shares of the Seller Common Stock:   (a) Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Seller ("Seller Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior  ------------------- to the Effective Time
(collectively, "Shares") (other than Shares held (i) in  ------ the
Seller\'s treasury or (ii) directly or indirectly by the Buyer or the
Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries (except for Trust Account
Shares or DPC Shares)) shall become and be converted automatically into the
right to receive in cash from the Buyer an amount equal to $26.00 (the
"Merger Consideration").  --------------------  (b) All of the Shares
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate")
previously representing any such Shares  ----------- shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Certificates
previously representing Shares shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance
with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon.   (c) At the
Effective Time, all Shares that are owned by the Seller as treasury stock,
all Shares that are held in trust under the Seller Restricted Stock Plan that
have not been allocated to an individual participant prior to the Effective
Time, and all Shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the Buyer or
the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries (other than Shares held
directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or
otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third
parties (any such Shares, whether held directly or indirectly by the Buyer or
the Seller, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account
Shares") and other than any Shares held by the Buyer or 
-------------------- the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries in
respect of a debt previously contracted (any such Shares which are similarly
held, whether held directly or indirectly by the Buyer or the Seller or any
of their respective subsidiaries, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares"))
shall be canceled and  ---------- shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   1.5 Merger Sub Common Stock. At
and after the Effective Time, each  ------------------------ share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately   2   prior to the Effective Time shall become and be
converted automatically into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.6 Employee Stock Options; Restricted Stock. 
----------------------------------------   (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Seller shall take all such action as is necessary to terminate as of the
Effective Time all outstanding stock options to purchase shares of Seller
Common Stock (each a "Stock Option") including, without limitation, Stock
Options issued pursuant to  ------------ the 1992 Stock Option Plan of
Roxborough Manayunk Bank, the 1994 Stock Option Plan of Roxborough Manayunk
Bank, and the 1999 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Seller Stock Option
Plans"). In connection therewith, each holder of a 
--------------------------- Stock Option (whether or not such Stock Option is
then vested or exercisable), shall be entitled to receive in cancellation of
any Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
a cash payment from the Seller at the Closing in an amount equal to the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Seller Common Stock
covered by such Stock Option, subject to any required withholding of taxes
(such payment, the "Stock Option  ------------ Cash Settlement") provided
that such Stock Option Cash Settlement shall be ---------------- conditioned
on such option holders executing an acknowledgement (the "Stock 
----- Option Settlement Acknowledgement") that the Stock Option Cash
Settlement ----------------------------------- represents the full amount
due for all Stock Options held by Seller. Seller shall have no obligation to
ensure execution of the Stock Option Settlement acknowledgements, although
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to assist in obtaining such
execution. The Seller Stock Option Plans and all Stock Options shall
terminate upon the foregoing terms at the Effective Time. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Buyer that the maximum number of shares of
Seller Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to the exercise of Stock
Options is not and shall not be at or prior to the Effective Time more than
694,235 shares.   (b) Upon the Effective Time, each previously awarded
but unvested restricted share of Seller Common Stock (collectively, the
"Seller  ------ Restricted Shares") granted under Seller\'s 1999 Restricted
Stock Plan (the ------------------ "Seller Restricted Share Plan") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the 
----------------------------- Effective Time shall be deemed earned and non-
forfeitable at such time under the Seller Restricted Share Plan. Upon the
Effective Time, the Seller or Seller Bank shall cancel each such Seller
Restricted Share in exchange for a cash payment (the "Restricted Stock Cash
Payment") to the award recipient in respect of each 
------------------------------ Seller Restricted Share equal to the Merger
Consideration, less applicable tax withholding. Such cancellation and cash-
out of such awards shall be conditioned on such award recipient executing an
acknowledgment (the "Restricted Stock  ----------------- Settlement
Acknowledgement") that the Restricted Stock Cash Payment
represents --------------------------- the full amount due for all shares of
Restricted Stock held by such recipient. Seller shall have no obligation to
ensure execution of the Restricted Stock Settlement Acknowledgement, although
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to assist in obtaining such
execution.   1.7 Articles of Incorporation. Subject to Section 6.6, unless
otherwise  ------------------------- determined by the Buyer, at the
Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Seller, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended to a form mutually
agreed upon by   3   the parties, and as so amended, shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law.   1.8
By-Laws. Subject to Section 6.6, at the Effective Time, the By-Laws 
------- of the Seller, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws.   1.9 Directors and Officers. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately  ----------------------- prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-
Laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   ARTICLE II - EXCHANGE OF
SHARES   2.1 Buyer to Deposit Aggregate Merger Consideration. At or prior to
the  ----------------------------------------------- Effective Time, the
Buyer shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to a bank or trust company
selected by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Seller (the "Exchange
Agent"), pursuant to an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to 
-------------- the Seller, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, such amount of cash as is
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration which holders of Shares
are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.   2.2 Exchange of
Shares.  ------------------   (a) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event later than three (3) business days
thereafter, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and other appropriate materials required to complete
the exchange of the Certificates for the Merger Consideration into which each
Share represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement and instructions to effect such
exchange. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal
and related materials, in each case as duly executed and properly completed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
each Share represented thereby, the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Seller, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and   4   other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.   (b) At any time following the expiration of the sixth
(6th) month after the Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds
which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other
income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available
to it), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them.   (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Seller of the Shares which were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
Shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.   (d) Neither the Buyer nor the Seller nor any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any shares or any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of any such Shares properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   (e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft
or destruction and to the ownership of such Certificate by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the receipt by
the Buyer of appropriate and customary indemnification, the Buyer will issue
in exchange for each Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, as determined in accordance with this
Article II.   5    ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

and the Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a

applicable, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their
respective terms.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Buyer or
the Parent of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which the

or other instrument or obligation to which the Parent or the Buyer is a party
as issuer, guarantor or obligor, or by which it or any of its properties or
assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case of clause (ii)(z) above,
for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which either
individually or in the aggregate will not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Parent or the Buyer.   3.3 Consents and Approvals. Except for consents,

or, to the best knowledge of the Buyer, threatened, against the Buyer or
any   7   subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Buyer or challenging the

meaning of PBCL Section 2553, and neither Buyer, Parent nor any such

Agents after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Seller Stockholders
Meeting if and so long as (a) the Board of Directors of the Seller determines
(i) in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable laws and (ii) that such a proposal is
or would be reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (b) prior

--------------- otherwise affect Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f) hereof). Any such withdrawal, modification or
change of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Seller shall
not change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Seller for purposes
of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   37   Seller
immediately will cease, and shall cause its Agents and subsidiaries and its
subsidiaries\' Agents to cease, all existing activities, discussions

this Agreement pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreements and
the Seller shall enforce, and shall not waive, any of the provisions of any
such confidentiality agreement.  From and after the execution of this
Agreement, Seller shall advise Buyer within the Notice Period of the receipt,
directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or
proposals relating to an Acquisition Transaction (including a summary of
material and significant terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
other individual or entity or individuals or entities involved), or its
receipt of any request for information from the Federal Reserve Board, the
OTS, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority with respect to an
Acquisition Transaction, and promptly furnish to Buyer a copy of any such
request for information or written proposal in addition to a copy of any
information provided to or by any third party relating thereto. In
addition, Seller shall promptly advise Buyer, in writing, if the Board of
Directors of the Seller shall make any determination as to any Acquisition
Transaction as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of this
Section 6.2. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit Seller
from, at any time, taking and disclosing to the Seller\'s stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act so long
as the requirements set forth in this Section 6.2 are satisfied. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior  -------- Proposal" shall mean any
bona fide Acquisition Transaction on terms the Board of -------- Directors
of the Seller determines in its good faith judgment taking into account the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (taking
into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Transaction,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation (including, without limitation, any financing conditions),
the likelihood and anticipated timing of consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the individual or
entity making the proposal) are in the aggregate more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Seller\'s stockholders than the
Merger Consideration, this Agreement and the Merger taken as a whole. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means any offer or
proposal for, or  ------------------------ any indication of interest in (a)
a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving the Seller or Seller Bank, (b) a purchase, lease or
other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets
or deposits of the Seller or all or substantially all of the assets or
deposits of Seller Bank, (c) a purchase or other acquisition (including by
way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial
ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement
having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Seller or Seller Bank, or
(d) any substantially similar transaction (but in any event not
including transactions contemplated by this Agreement). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Notice Period" shall mean (i) with respect to written
inquiries or  -------------- proposals or other written materials, written
notice as promptly as practicable and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt   38   thereof and (ii) with respect to oral
inquires, discussions, negotiations, or proposals, oral notice as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt
thereof, followed by written notice in no event later than one (1) business
day after receipt of such oral inquires, discussions, negotiations, or
proposals. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall affect Seller\'s obligation to
hold the Seller Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.1
hereof.   6.3 Access to Information.  ---------------------   (a) Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the Buyer and the Seller, for the purposes of verifying
the representations and warranties of the other and relating to the Merger
and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause
each of their respective subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time,
to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and,
during such period, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws
(other than reports or documents which the Buyer or the Seller, as the case
may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request; provided, however, that each of the parties hereby
acknowledges and agrees that ------------------ any such access or provision
of information shall be scheduled and managed so as not to unreasonably
interfere with or disrupt the business or operations of the party providing
access or information. Subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence, the
Seller also shall provide the Buyer with reasonable access to the Seller\'s
officers, employees and agents and with copies of all periodic reports to the
Seller\'s senior management, provided, however, that in addition to the 
------------------ following sentence, with respect to any Loan Property,
Buyer may not conduct any invasive environmental testing or sampling without
the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Neither the Buyer nor the Seller nor any of their respective subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the
extent such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the
Buyer\'s customers or the Seller\'s customers, as the case may be, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement.   (b) All information furnished by any party hereto to
the other or its representatives pursuant hereto shall be treated as the
sole property of the party providing the information and, if the Merger shall
not occur, the party being furnished such information shall return to the
other party all of such written information and all documents, notes,
summaries or other materials containing, reflecting or referring to, or
derived from, such information. The parties hereto shall, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their representatives to, keep confidential
all such information, and shall not directly or indirectly use such
information for any competitive or other commercial purpose. The obligation
to keep such information confidential and not to use such information shall
continue for five years from the date the proposed Merger is abandoned and
shall not apply to (i) any information which (x) was already   39   in
the possession of the party being furnished such information prior to
the disclosure thereof by the other party, (y) was then generally known to
the public, or (z) was disclosed to the party being furnished such
information by a third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality;
or (ii) disclosures made as required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything herein to the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and any
employee, representative or other agent of any party to this Agreement) may
disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided, however, that such disclosure  ------------------ may
not be made to the extent required to be kept confidential to comply with any
applicable federal or state securities laws; and provided further that
(to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing) such disclosure shall be
made without disclosing the names or other identifying information of any
party.   (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth herein.   6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of the Buyer and
its Affiliates,  --------------------------- and the Seller shall, and the
Seller shall cause its subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective
subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5 Employment and Benefit Matters. 
------------------------------   (a) Provision of Benefits. As soon as
practicable after the  --------------------- Effective Time, the Buyer
agrees to provide the employees of the Seller and its subsidiaries who remain
employed after the Effective Time (the "Seller  ------ Employees") with at
least the types and levels of employee benefits
(including --------- employee contribution levels) maintained from time to
time by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for similarly-situated
employees of the Buyer. The Buyer will treat, and cause the applicable
benefit plans to treat, the service of Seller Employees with Seller or any
subsidiary of Seller attributable to any period before the Effective Time as
service rendered to the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits
including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation, but not for benefit accrual (including minimum pension
amount), eligibility for early retirement and eligibility for retiree welfare
benefit plans, attributable to any period before the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall not treat any Seller Employee as a
"new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar
plan of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for a pre-existing medical
condition, and any deductibles paid under any of Seller\'s or its
subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles under
the health plans of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer upon delivery to
the   40   Buyer of appropriate documentation. From and after the
Effective Time, directors of Seller shall no longer be eligible to
participate in any benefit plans of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates; provided, however, that such directors may continue to
participate in a health plan of Seller, Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates to the extent provided by the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985. The Buyer will make appropriate arrangements with its insurance
carrier(s) to ensure such result.   (b) Continuation of Plans.
Notwithstanding anything to the  ----------------------- contrary contained
herein, and except as set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and except with respect to the Seller Bank ESOP, which shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time as provided in Section 6.5(g) hereof and
except with respect to the severance and other benefits described in Section
6.5(c) below and the matters discussed in Section 5.1 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer shall have sole discretion following
the Effective Time with respect to the determination as to whether or when
to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of
the Seller; provided, however, that the Buyer shall continue to maintain the
Seller  ------------------ plans (other than stock-based or incentive plans
or stock funds in retirement plans) until the Seller Employees are permitted
to participate in the plans of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer.
Nothing in this Agreement shall alter or limit the Buyer\'s obligations, if
any, under ERISA, as amended by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 and/or the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to the rights of Seller Employees and
their qualified beneficiaries in connection with the group health plan
maintained by the Seller as of the Effective Time.   (c) Severance Pay Plan.
The Buyer shall provide the severance  ------------------ benefits set forth
in Section 6.5(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule ("Schedule 6.5(c)") to
any Seller Employee (except those specifically excluded in Schedule 6.5(c))
on a salary continuation basis who is not otherwise covered by a specific
termination, severance or change in control agreement (provided, 
-------- however, that the compensation set forth in Section 5.1 of the
Seller Disclosure ------- Schedule shall be deemed not to be such a
termination, severance, or change of control agreement) and who is terminated
by the Buyer or its Affiliates for reasons other than cause (which shall mean
gross negligence or dereliction in the performance of such employee\'s
duties, dishonesty or commission of a crime) in the six (6) month period
immediately following the Closing Date. Payment of severance pay is
conditioned on the execution by Seller Employee of a release in a form
satisfactory to the Buyer and the expiration of any statutory
expiration period.   (d) Compensation Agreements. The Buyer shall honor,
in  ------------------------- accordance with these terms, all compensation
agreements listed in Section 6.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.  
(e) Parachute Payouts. Notwithstanding anything to the 
------------------- contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall
the Seller, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank, or
any of their respective subsidiaries, take any action or make any payments
that would result, either individually or in the aggregate, in the payment of
a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G or that would
result, either individually or in the aggregate, in payments that would be
nondeductible pursuant to Code Section 162(m).   41   The Seller and the
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve matters relating
to any of the foregoing.   (f) Continuation of Employment. No provision of
this Section  --------------------------- 6.5 shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
and no provision of this Section 6.5 shall create such rights in any such
persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly
or indirectly, under any employee program or any plan or arrangement which
may be established by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Subject to Section
6.5(b), no provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the
rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Effective Time any such plans
or arrangements of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.   (g) Seller Bank
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. As soon as 
---------------------------------------------- practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Seller shall cause the Seller Bank to file or cause to
be filed all necessary documents with the IRS, for a determination letter for
termination of the Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan (the "Seller
Bank ESOP") as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the Seller
Bank ESOP shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time and after the receipt of a favorable
determination letter for termination from the IRS, the account balances in
the Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan shall be distributed to
participants and beneficiaries in accordance with applicable law and
the terms of the Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan in effect as of
the date of this Agreement; provided that the Seller or Seller Bank may amend
such plan as deemed necessary to maintain compliance with applicable law or
regulation or as requested by the IRS in order to obtain a favorable letter
of determination. Prior to the Effective Time, contributions to, and payments
on the loan of, the Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan shall be made
consistent with past practices on the regularly scheduled payment dates.  
(h) Buyer and Parent acknowledge that upon the Effective Time
the responsibilities and authorities of John F. McGill, Jr. shall be
materially diminished and reduced for purposes of Section 9 of the employment
agreement dated as of January 21, 1998 between the Seller Bank and Mr.
McGill.   6.6 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance. 
------------------------------------------------------   (a) In the event of
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of
Seller or any of its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole  -------------------- or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact
that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Seller, any of
the Seller\'s subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any
case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall   42   indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted of arising before
or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with the Buyer;
provided,  --------- however, that (w) the Buyer shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof ------- (provided the Buyer confirms in writing
to the Indemnified Party its obligations to indemnify such party to the
fullest extent permitted by law and provided the Buyer is at least
"adequately capitalized" as defined in the relevant corrective action
regulations) and upon such assumption the Buyer or the Surviving Bank shall
not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Buyer elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties and
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between the Buyer and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after
consultation with the Buyer, and the Buyer shall, to the extent consistent
with the Seller\'s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, periodically
advance the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (x) the Buyer shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, unless the proposed
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest among such
parties, in which case the Buyer shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of one additional counsel to the extent necessary to avoid such conflict, (y)
the Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (z)
the Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under
this Section 6.6, promptly following learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Buyer thereof, provided,
that the failure to so notify shall not  --------------- affect the
obligations of the Buyer under this Section 6.6 except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices the Buyer. The Buyer\'s
obligations under this Section 6.6 shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to  ------------------ indemnification in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Seller
shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under its existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (the "DandO; Insurance")
coverage for the Seller\'s  ------------- directors and officers in a form
acceptable to the Seller which shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially   43   less
favorable on the whole to, the insured persons than the directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the
Seller. Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate in good faith with Buyer in
order to obtain the lowest premium for such coverage (it being understood,
however, that any such carrier will have no less than an AX Best\'s Rating).
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.   (c) In the event the Buyer or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer assume the obligations set forth in this section.  
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and nothing herein shall affect, modify or limit
any indemnification rights that any Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives may have under the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws
of the Seller or the equivalent documents of any of the Seller\'s
subsidiaries, any contract or applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
and By-Laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries shall be effected, whether at or after the Effective Time, that
amends, modifies, limits or otherwise changes in a manner adverse to the
directors or officers of the Seller or its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, the rights of such parties to indemnification or advancement
of expenses under such Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws (or similar
organizational documents) or any provisions of such instruments that limit
the liability of such directors or officers.   6.7 Additional Agreements.
In case at any time after the Effective Time  --------------------- any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries
shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and
at the sole expense of, the Buyer.   6.8 Advice of Changes. The Buyer and
the Seller shall each promptly  ------------------ notify the other party of
any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice 
------------------ pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   6.9 Update of Disclosure Schedules. From time to time prior to
the  -------------------------------- Effective Time, the Seller will
promptly supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedule in writing to
reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to   44   correct any
information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time,
the Seller shall provide the Buyer with a written copy of the complete
Seller Disclosure Schedule, marked to show any and all such supplements and
amendments, and/or, if no such supplements or amendments were made to a
particular Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Seller shall
provide the Buyer with a certificate signed on behalf of the Seller by a duly
authorized officer of the Seller to such effect. No supplement or amendment
to the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) hereof
or compliance by the Seller with the covenants set forth in Article V
hereof.   6.10 Current Information.  -------------------   (a) As soon as
practicable, the Seller will furnish to the Buyer copies of all such
financial statements and reports as it or any of its subsidiaries shall send
to its stockholders, the SEC or any other Governmental Authority, to the
extent any such reports furnished to any such Governmental Authority are not
confidential and except as legally prohibited thereby, and will furnish to
the Buyer such additional financial data as the Buyer may reasonably
request.   (b) Promptly upon receipt thereof, the Seller will furnish
to the Buyer copies of all internal control reports submitted to the Seller
and its subsidiaries by independent auditors in connection with each annual,
interim or special audit of the books of the Seller and its subsidiaries made
by such auditors.   (c) The Seller will promptly notify the Buyer of any
material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the
properties of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries and of any governmental
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of material
litigation involving the Seller or any of its subsidiaries, and will keep the
Buyer reasonably informed of such events.   6.11 Transition Committee.
Immediately upon the execution of this  --------------------- Agreement, the
Seller shall designate certain of its respective employees as "Liaisons."
During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective 
-------- Time, the Seller\'s Liaisons will (a) confer on a regular and
continued basis with representatives of the Buyer to report on (i) the
general status of the ongoing operations of the Seller and its subsidiaries,
(ii) the status of, and the action proposed to be taken with respect to,
those loans held by the Seller or any of its subsidiaries which, either
individually or in combination with one or more other loans to the same

order to facilitate the foregoing, the Seller and the Buyer shall promptly
establish a transition committee which will be led by a  
45   representative of the Buyer and which will meet on a regular basis to
discuss these matters and may establish sub-committees from time-to-time to
pursue various issues. In addition, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, within two (2) business days after the
Seller Bank delivers to the members of any of its credit committees
applicable information and reports for the next upcoming meeting of such
committee, the Seller shall provide to a representative designated by the
Buyer access to the same information and reports as are provided to the
Seller Bank\'s credit committee members with respect to new loans or renewals
thereof and extensions of credit proposed to be made by the Seller Bank in
excess of $750,000. The representative designated by the Buyer shall also be
allowed to attend any of the Seller Bank\'s credit committee meetings for all
loans or loan renewals and be a non-voting observer thereof. Moreover, to
facilitate the transactions contemplated herein, immediately upon execution
of this Agreement, the Seller will designate a Senior Vice President to
assist Buyer with interim operating and conversion matters.   6.12

Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power  and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to carry on  its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of  this Agreement by the Merger Sub and the consummation of the

corporate action on the part of the Merger  Sub and will not (y) conflict
with or violate the Articles  of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Merger Sub
or (z)  conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order,  judgment
or decree applicable to the Merger Sub or by which  any of its properties or
assets is bound or affected; and   46    (iii) The Merger Sub has

Parent for the payment or enforcement of any obligation or liability of the
Buyer hereunder or thereunder without pursuing or exhausting remedies against
the Buyer or prior notification to the Buyer and without regard to any
regulatory restrictions which are applicable to the Buyer but not to the

or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consideration or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
