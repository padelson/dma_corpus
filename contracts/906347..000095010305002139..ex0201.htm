ARTICLE 2 
 THE MERGER

 

 Section 2.01. _The  Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions  of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged  (the "Merger")  with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the  separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall  be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving  Corporation"). 

 

 (b) As  soon as practicable (and, in any event, within five Business Days) after  satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions  to the Merger set forth in _Article 9_ ,  other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective  Time and will in fact be satisfied at the Effective Time, the Company and  Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary  of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law  in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such  time (the "Effective Time")  as the certificate of merger relating to the Merger is duly filed with the  Delaware Secretary of State (or such later time as may be agreed by the  parties in writing and specified in the certificate of merger). 

 

 (c) From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all  the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the  obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and  Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

 

 Section 2.02. _Conversion  of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue  of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

 

 (a) except  as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ or _Section 2.04_ , each share of Company  Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with  the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be converted into  the right to receive (i) $16.25 in cash, without interest, and (ii)  0.115 shares of Parent Stock, together with the cash in lieu of fractional  shares of Parent Stock as specified below; 

 

12   
 

 (b) each  share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately  prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to  each such share) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment  shall be made with respect thereto; and 

 

 (c) each  share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common  stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation. 

 

 Section 2.03. _Surrender  and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective  Time, Parent, with the Companys prior approval (which shall not  be unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange  Agent") for the purpose of exchanging  for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates that immediately prior to  the Effective Time represented shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates"),  and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Concurrently  with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited  with, the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company  Stock, (i) a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for  the Exchange Agent to make payments under _Section  2.02(a)_ and (ii) subject to Parents  option in _Section 2.03(b)_ to provide uncertificated  book-entry shares, certificates representing shares of Parent Stock into  which shares of Company Stock are converted in the Merger, in each case,  for exchange in accordance with this _Article  2_. The Merger Consideration into which shares  of Company Stock are converted pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed  to have been issued at the Effective Time. Promptly (and, in any event,  within two Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall send,  or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of  Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions  (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of  loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates  or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance  with the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) for use in  such exchange, such letter of transmittal and instructions to be in such  form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably  agree. 

 

 (b) Each  holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right  to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger  Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate  or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,  together with a properly completed letter of transmittal; or (ii) receipt  of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other  evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)  in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Any shares  of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents  option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate  is required under Applicable Law.

 

13   
 

Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may  be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after  the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger  Consideration.

 

 (c) If  any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other  than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred  Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment  that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise  be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly  transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the  Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such  payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate  or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange  Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

 

 (d) From  and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of  transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  are surrendered to or Uncertificated Shares are transferred to the Surviving  Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration  provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article  2_. 

 

 (e) Any  portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent  pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ that  remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six months after  the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such  holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration  in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ prior  to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger  Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto,  in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company  Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned  property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders  of shares of Company Stock one Business Day prior to such time when such  amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental  Authority, shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the  property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person  previously entitled thereto. 

 

 (f) No  dividends or other distributions with respect to any securities of Parent  constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu  of fractional shares as provided in _Section  2.07_ , shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates  not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such  Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as  the case may be, as provided in this _Section  2.03_. Following such surrender or transfer,  there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities  of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer,  the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such  

 

14   
 

Person is entitled pursuant to _Section  2.07_ and the amount of all
dividends or  other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously  paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to
such securities,  and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and prior to  surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to
surrender  or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

 

 Section 2.04. _Dissenting  Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ _2.02_ that  may be deemed to the contrary, shares of Company Stock which are issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a  holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in  writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Stock  in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law and as to which the  right to appraisal has not been failed to be perfected, withdrawn or otherwise  lost in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law (collectively,  the "Dissenting Shares")  shall not be converted into a right to receive any Merger Consideration  pursuant to _Section_ _2.02_.  If, after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to  perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares  shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time  into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give  Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal  of shares of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate  in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not  make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such  demands. 

 

 Section 2.05 _.  Stock Options and Other Equity Awards._ (a)  The terms of each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock  ("Company Stock Options")  or stock appreciation right with respect to Company Stock ("Company  SARs") granted under the Company Stock  Plan, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be adjusted to provide  that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option or Company SAR,  as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be automatically converted into an option to acquire, or stock appreciation  right with respect to (each such option, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted  Option" and each such stock appreciation  right, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted  SAR"), on the same terms and conditions  (including as to exercisability and vesting, taking into account, any  acceleration resulting from the Merger) as were applicable under such  Company Stock Option, or Company SAR, as applicable, the number of shares  of Parent Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject  to such Company Stock Option or Company SAR, as applicable, _multiplied  by_ (ii) the Conversion Ratio, at a price  per share of Parent Stock equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price or  base price for such Company Stock Option or Company SAR (which, with respect  to the Company SAR listed on _Section 2.05(a)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ shall  be zero), as applicable, _divided by_ (B)  the number of shares of Parent Stock to which such 

 

15   
 

Adjusted Option or Adjusted SAR is subject; _provided_ that  (x) any
fractional share of Parent Stock resulting from an aggregation of  all the
shares of a holder subject to Company Stock Option or Company SAR,  as
applicable, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and (y)  the
exercise price or base price of any Adjusted Option or Adjusted SAR,  as
applicable, shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For purposes  of
this _Section 2.05(a)_ , "Conversion  Ratio" means the Company Closing Per 
Share Amount (as defined below) _divided by_ the  closing price of a share of
Parent Stock on NASDAQ, as reported in the New  York City edition of _The
Wall Street Journal_ , on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the "Parent  Closing Per Share Amount"). For purposes  of this
_Section 2.05(a)_ , "Company  Closing Per Share Amount" means the sum  of
(1) $16.25 _plus_ (2)  0.115 shares of Parent Stock _multiplied by_ the 
Parent Closing Per Share Amount.

 

 (b) At  the Effective Time, all shares of Company restricted stock granted under  the Company Stock Plan outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or  not vested, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the  Merger Consideration on the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable  sections of this Article 2. 

 

 (c) Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) obtain any consents from holders  of Company Stock Options or Company SARs, and (ii) make any appropriate  amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plan, and the Board of Directors  of the Company shall adopt appropriate resolutions, that, in the case of  either clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary to give effect to the transactions  contemplated by this _Section 2.05_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section  2.05_ , payment may be withheld in respect of  any Company Stock Option or Company SAR, as applicable, until such necessary  consents are obtained. 

 

 (d) Parent  shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of Company Stock  Options pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ , including the reservation,  issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions  contemplated by this _Section 2.05_. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement  on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration  statement previously filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares  of Parent Stock subject to the Adjusted Options, and, where applicable,  shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement  declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and  to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such  Adjusted Options for so long as such Adjusted Options remain outstanding. 

 

 Section 2.06. _Adjustments_.  If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective  Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company  or Parent shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,  stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or  readjustment of shares, any stock dividend thereon with a record date during  such period, or any similar event, the Merger Consideration 

 

16   
 

and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement  shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 

 Section 2.07 _.  Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares  of Parent Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of  Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise  be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and  if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall  be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest  determined by multiplying the closing price of a share of Parent Stock  on NASDAQ, as reported in the New York City edition of _The  Wall Street Journal_ , on the trading day  immediately preceding the Closing Date by the fraction of a share of Parent  Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled. 

 

 Section 2.08. _Withholding  Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation  and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration  otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article  2_ such amounts as it is required to deduct  and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision  of national, federal, state or local Tax law. If the Surviving Corporation  or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall  be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the  holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

 

 Section 2.09. _Lost  Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have  been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that  fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed  and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person  of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may  direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange  for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration  to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such  Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article  2_.

Effect.

performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and

(as applicable), validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all corporate
(or other organizational) powers and all Governmental Authorizations required
to carry on its business as now conducted, with such exceptions as would not

Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign business entity and is (to the extent applicable) in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except

securities or  ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of Parent, or (iii)
restricted shares,  stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent

(i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to collectively  as the "Parent Subsidiary
Securities").  There are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries  to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Parent
Subsidiary Securities.

 

  (c) There are no joint venture agreements to which Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent is a party that is material to Parent and

ended March 31, 2005  and June 30, 2005, (iii) its proxy or information
statements relating to  meetings of, or actions taken without a meeting by,
the stockholders of  Parent held (or actions taken without a meeting by such
stockholders) since  December 31, 2003, and (iv) all of its other reports,
statements, schedules,  registration statements and other documents filed
with (or furnished on  Form 8-K to) the SEC since December 31, 2003 (the
documents referred to in clauses (i)-(iv) above, collectively, the "Parent
SEC Documents").

 

  (b) As of the date it was filed with (or furnished on Form 8-K to) the
SEC, each Parent SEC Document complied, and each such Parent SEC Document
filed (or furnished on Form 8-K) subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as
to

 

  42   
   

  form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.

 

  (c) As of the date it was filed with (or furnished on Form 8-K to) the
SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a document prior to the date hereof, on
the date such document was filed with (or furnished on Form 8-K to) the SEC),
each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such
Parent SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

  (d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as
of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 

  (f) Parent  has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined  in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures  are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including  its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in Parents periodic reports
required under the 1934 Act.

 

  (g) Parent  maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule  13a-under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting  is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external  purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes
policies and procedures that  (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of Parent,  (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of Parent  are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and  directors of Parent, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could
have a

 

  43   
   

  material effect on its financial statements.  Prior to the date hereof
(or, with respect to evaluations first made after  the date hereof, promptly
after the date of such evaluations), Parent has  disclosed, based on the most
recent evaluation of its chief executive officer  and its chief financial
officer, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents board of
directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and has identified for Parents auditors and audit
committee of Parents board of directors any material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal control over financial reporting. Prior to the date hereof
(or, with respect to disclosures or communications first made after the date
hereof, promptly after they are made), Parent has made available to the
Company (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Parents
auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2004 and (ii) any material
communication since December 31, 2004 made by management or Parents auditors
to the audit committee required or contemplated by the listing standards of
NASDAQ, the audit committees charter or professional standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board.

financial statements and unaudited consolidated  interim financial statements
included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly  present, in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the  periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), the  consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (or the "Predecessor Company" as  defined in the
Parent SEC Documents, as the case may be) as of the dates  thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for  the periods then ended
(subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case  of any unaudited interim

aggregate, material).

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not (i) at the time the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is filed with the SEC, (ii) at the time it is mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and Parent, (iii) at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, or (iv) at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material

shares of capital stock of, or other voting securities or ownership interests
in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or

threatened against or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present
or former officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
in their respective capacities as such, before any arbitrator or before or by
any Governmental Authority (but excluding investigations or proceedings in

and binding obligation of Parent and is in full force and effect and no event
within the direct control of Parent or Merger Subsidiary has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to

_provided_ , _however_ , that any withdrawal of, any modification or
qualification in a manner adverse to Parent of the Company Board
Recommendation, or any recommendation of an Acquisition Proposal (each such

best efforts to secure the Company Stockholder Approval, and (iii) otherwise

stockholders at  the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or not (A) an
Adverse Company Recommendation  Change shall have occurred, and/or (B) any
Acquisition Proposal shall have  been publicly proposed or announced or

  Section 6.03 _. No Solicitation; Other Offers_.  The Company agrees

its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
employees, agents and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) amend or
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its

Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") are simultaneously
waived), (iii) approve any transaction under, or any Third Party becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the Delaware Law, (iv) amend
or grant any waiver or release or approve any transaction or redeem any
Company Rights under the Company Rights Agreement, (v) make any Adverse
Company Recommendation Change in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
(vi) enter into any definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (1) complying with
its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) of the Exchange
Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such disclosure constitutes an Adverse Company Recommendation Change, Parent
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section
10.01(c)(i)_ of this Agreement; and (2) at any time prior to, but not after,
the time this Agreement is adopted by the Company Stockholder Approval, (A)
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors of the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information, prior to the provision of any such information, an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that, such executed
confidentiality agreement may contain less favorable standstill provisions as
long

 

  53   
   

  as Parents obligations under the standstill  provisions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement are simultaneously  waived); (B) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person  who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the  Board of Directors of the Company
receives from such Person, prior thereto,  an executed confidentiality
agreement as described in the immediately preceding  clause (A); or (C)
recommending or making any Adverse Company Recommendation  Change in
connection with such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal
to the stockholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that,  (x) in
each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the  Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation  with
outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its 
directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties, (y) in each  case
referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of  the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial 
advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal, if 
accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all 
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the likelihood  of
obtaining financing, and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, 
would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders 
from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this 
Agreement taking into account any change proposed by Parent; and (z) in  the
case of clause (C), Parent shall have had written notice of the Companys 
intention to take the action referred to in clause (C) at least 20 Business 
Days prior to the taking of such action by the Company (which notice shall 
have attached the most current version of the agreement relating to the 
Acquisition Proposal in question and a summary of any other material terms 
relating thereto) and Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives  to,
during such 20 Business Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent  with
respect to any changes Parent may wish to make with respect to its  proposal;
_provided_ , that any more favorable Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (B) or (C) above must constitute an Acquisition Proposal that involves
the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the voting power
of the Company Stock or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal is referred to in
this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, including any discussions or negotiations with
respect to the possible sale of the Flextech Group. The Company agrees that
it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 6.03_ of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section_ _6.03_. The Company agrees that it
will notify Parent promptly, but in any event within 48 hours if any
proposals or offers referred to in this _Section 6.03_ are received by, any
such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed on a current basis, and, in any event,
within 24 hours of any changes in the status, the terms and any other
material details of any such proposals or offers, including whether any such
proposal has been

 

  54   
   

  withdrawn or rejected. The Company also agrees  to provide any
information to Parent that it is providing to another Person  pursuant to
this _Section 6.03_ at substantially the same time it provides it to such
other Person. The Company agrees promptly, but in any event, within five days
after the date of this Agreement, to request the return or destruction of all
information and materials provided prior to the date of this Agreement by it,
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives (and any information
derived therefrom) with respect to the consideration or making of any

Flextech Group) and the Company shall otherwise use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreement relating thereto.

Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  to, assist and cooperate
with Parent in connection with (A) any proposed  (i) sale of all or a
substantial portion of the Companys and/or any  of its Subsidiaries
ownership  interest in, or all or a substantial portion of the assets of, the
Flextech  Group, to, or (ii) entry into a joint venture or other business
combination  transaction relating to the Flextech Group with, in either case,
one or  more Third Parties (any such proposed or potential Third Party, a
"Flextech  Transaction Party") and on such terms and conditions as Parent 
shall determine (any transactions contemplated by clause (i) or (ii) above, a
" **Flextech Transaction** "), _provided_ that, (1) Parent shall consult with

with the Waiver).

 

  (b) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall, and shall cause  its Subsidiaries to, (A) in connection with any

determined that such Person is not  entitled to indemnification). In the
event any Claim or Claims are asserted or made within such six year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.

 

 (b) For  six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall  provide officers and directors liability insurance with  an insurer with a 

 

 

  59   
 

  Standard and Poors rating of at least A (or an equivalent rating from AM
Best), or Parent shall purchase from an insurer with a Standard and Poors
rating of at least A (or an equivalent rating from AM Best), a "tail policy",
in each case, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof (which policy has been provided by the Company to Parent);
_provided_  that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance during
such period shall exceed £6,000,000, then the Surviving Corporation shall
provide a policy with the best coverage as shall then be available at
£6,000,000 per annum.

 

  (c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.03_
shall be in addition to any rights to indemnification and exculpation of
personal liability that such Person may have under Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law, or any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

 

  (d) Any  Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section  7.03_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall  promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve  Parent or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such  Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure prejudices Parent or  the Surviving Corporation. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective  Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall  have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent or the Surviving  Corporation, as the case may be, shall
not be liable to such Indemnified  Person for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently  incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense thereof,  except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume  such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Person advises the Indemnified  Person in good faith that there
are issues that raise conflicts of interest  between Parent and the
Indemnified Person that make such assumption unadvisable,  the Indemnified
Person may retain counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the  Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and such party shall  pay the
reasonable legal expenses of such Indemnified Person promptly as  statements
therefor are received, (ii) the Indemnified Person will cooperate  in the
defense of any such matter, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation  or Parent,
as the case may be, shall not be liable for any settlement effected  without
its prior written consent; _provided_ that, the Surviving Corporation  or
Parent, as the case may be, shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Person when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law.

 

60   
 

  (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.03_.

 

  Section 7.04 _. Parent Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material_.  Subject
to its fiduciary duties, Parent shall cause a meeting of its stockholders 
(the "Parent Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purposes of obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval. Subject to its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall recommend the Parent Stockholder Approval, and shall not withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company such recommendation. In connection
with the Parent Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall (i) mail the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to Parents stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the 1933 Act
and, if necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws, after
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed,
promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and,
if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies, (ii) subject to its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and subject to the foregoing, use
reasonable best efforts to secure the Parent Stockholder Approval, and (iii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.

 

  Section 7.05 _. Quotation of Stock._ Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in connection with
the Merger to be to be approved for quotation on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance.

 

  Section  7.06 _. Parent Board Of Directors;  Certain Members of_
_Management._ Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
action to appoint  to the Board of Directors of Parent Mr. Anthony Stenham
and one additional  member of the Companys Board of Directors selected by
Parent with the approval of the Companys Board of Directors, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed (or, if either one of them is unable or
unwilling to serve in that capacity, such other individual as may be
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) subject, in the case of Mr.
Stenham, to him agreeing with Parent, on terms mutually satisfactory to him
and Parent, his terms for service as Deputy Chairman, which Parent agrees to
negotiate in good faith. In addition, Parent will appoint, or cause to
be appointed, those individuals set forth in _Section 7.06 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule_ to the positions set forth in such Section of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule subject to such individuals agreeing with
Parent, on terms mutually satisfactory to Parent and such individuals, terms
of employment, which Parent agrees to negotiate in good faith.

 

  61   
 

  Section 7.07 _. Company Employees._ (a) Parent agrees that it will
comply with Applicable Law with respect to the rights of the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to their employment with the
Company or its any of its Subsidiaries.

 

  (b) Parent  will cause any employee benefit plans which the employees
of the Company  and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in after the
Effective  Time, other than any plan in which any such employee participated
prior  to the Effective Time (a "Prior Plan"),  to take into account for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual  thereunder, except for
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans,  for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to  the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits, service by employees  of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent,  to the
extent that such service was recognized under any analogous Prior Plan.

  unless, in the case of all such requirements  described in clauses (iv)
and (v) above, such requirements would not, individually  or in the aggregate
with all other such requirements, reasonably be expected  to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect,  in each case,
without regard to clause (b) and clause (iv) (insofar as such  clause (iv)
relates to any matter contemplated by clause (iv) or (v) above)  of each such
definition (a "Regulatory  Material Adverse Effect"); _provided_ , _however_
,  that Parent can compel the Company to take any of the actions referred 
to above (or agree to take such actions) if such actions are only effective

(ii) sell, transfer, dispose of or divest, or hold separate all or a

efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective  under the 1933
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep  the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate  the

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Schedule 13E-3, will be made by
the Company or Parent without the approval of the other party, which will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by Applicable
Law; _provided_ that, with respect to documents filed by the Company or
Parent which are incorporated by reference in any of the aforementioned U.S.
Disclosure Filings, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations.

 

  (d) Each  of Parent and the Company shall advise the other party and
its counsel,  promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration  Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed,  the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the  shares of Parent Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering  or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of  any of the U.S. Disclosure Filings or comments thereon and
responses thereto  or requests by the SEC for additional information. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, the

 

  65   
 

  Company or Parent discover any information relating  to either party, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,  that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the U.S.  Disclosure
Filings, so that any of such documents would not include any  misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary  to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which  they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information  shall
promptly notify the other parties and the parties will cooperate with  each
other in order to promptly file with the SEC and, to the extent required  by
Applicable Law, disseminate to the stockholders of the Company and Parent, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information.

requested in connection with any such action.

securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release,
make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or

release and disseminating it in a timely manner.

warranty made by any party hereunder.

_provided, however_ that,  the delivery of any notice pursuant to this

  (d) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, they would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if any party fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this  _Section 11.04_ , it shall also pay any costs
and expenses incurred by the other party (including legal fees and expenses)
in connection with any action, including the prosecution of any lawsuit or
other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid amount at the publicly announced prime rate of JPMorgan
in New York City from the date such fee was required to be paid to the date it
is paid.

 

  Section 11.05 _. Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto
agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement, and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations
and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read
that reference and such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed.

  Section 11.06 _. Alternative Transactions._ (a) Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that Parent
may, at any time prior to the Closing Date, elect (in its absolute
discretion) (i) by serving a written notice to the Company as set forth in
_Section 11.06(a) of the Parent Disclosure_   _Schedule_ to effect the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated herein by causing Parent to be merged
with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (which shall be a
newly incorporated Delaware corporation) in which Parents stockholders would
receive shares of the Company Stock as the merger consideration in connection
with such alternative transaction and, immediately prior thereto to or
contemporaneously therewith, the Company would cause a special dividend to be
paid (or otherwise make a cash payment) to its stockholders such that the
economic result would be the same as if the Merger Consideration were paid in
accordance with this Agreement (such transaction, the "Alternative Merger"),
as long as the Alternative Merger does not adversely affect the stockholders
of the Company (except in immaterial respects); or (ii) by serving a written
notice to the Company as set forth in _Section 11.06(a) of the Parent_
_Disclosure Schedule_ , to require the Company to reorganize all or any of
its interests in the UKTV Group (which, for this purpose, shall include its
interests in Progco) (to the extent permitted under the provisions of the
shareholders agreements and articles of association governing the UKTV
Group) and to sell or otherwise transfer such interests in such manner as
Parent may require (an "Alternative Transfer") immediately prior to the
expected Closing Date and at the time when all conditions to closing set
forth in Article 9 have been satisfied or irrevocably waived, other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Effective Time and
will in fact be satisfied at the Effective Time, at fair market value as
agreed between Parent and the Company (or, failing such agreement, as
determined by an investment bank selected mutually by them), such
consideration to be satisfied in cash or such other consideration as Parent
shall reasonably request. Without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, Parent may elect to do the following pursuant to this _Section
11.06(a)(ii)_ :

      |   (i)  |   interposition of a newly incorporated English
company ("IntermediateCo"), between Telewest Communications Networks Limited
and Flextech Broadband Limited ("Flextech Broadband");   
---|---|--- 
     |   |   
    |   (ii)  |   transfer to IntermediateCo by way of capital
contribution of all of the issued share capitals of both Flextech Digital
Broadcasting Limited ("Flextech Digital") and Flextech Broadband;   
     |   |   
    |   (iii)  |   transfer to IntermediateCo of all of the loan stock
issued to the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than Flextech Broadband and
Flextech Digital) by members of the UKTV Group and their respective
Subsidiaries at fair market value left outstanding on intercompany account
(or, if any such loan stock cannot be transferred without the consent of   
 

  83         |   | BBC Worldwide Limited or its Affiliates, the transfer
to Flextech Broadband by way of a capital contribution of all of the issued
share capitals of the Subsidiaries of the Company which own such loan stock);
and   
---|---|--- 
      |   |   
      | (iv)  | transfer to Parent or a wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent (or such other person as it shall nominate) of the entire
issued share capital of IntermediateCo with full title guarantee free from all
liens, charges and encumbrances for fair market value (as agreed between
Parent and the Company (or, failing such agreement, as determined by an
investment bank selected mutually by them)) to be satisfied in cash or such
other consideration as Parent shall reasonably request.   
  

  If an Alternative Transfer shall occur pursuant to this Section
11.06(a)(ii) and the Closing Date shall not then occur within one Business Day
after such Alternative Transfer (or such longer period as Parent and the
Company may agree), Parent shall (or shall procure that the transferee shall)
transfer back to the Company or such of its Subsidiaries as it shall nominate
the assets so acquired for a consideration equal to the consideration paid by
the Parent or its Subsidiary for such assets and during that that period
between the Alternative Transfer and the transfer back shall take no action
that reduces the value of such assets. The Company and Parent shall use,
subject to the terms hereof, reasonable best endeavors to obtain all third
party consents which may be required to effect any reorganization or
Alternative Transfer as contemplated by _Section 11.06(a)(ii)_ and the Company
shall cause Deutsche Bank A.G. to confirm that no fee will be payable to it
or its Affiliates as a result of the Alternative Transaction.

 

  (b) Should Parent elect, pursuant to this _Section 11.06_ , to cause
an Alternative Merger to be effected rather than the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that they will amend
and restate this Agreement (including the schedules hereto) to (i) reflect the
structure of the Alternative Merger while maintaining, as closely as
possible, the substance of the agreements herein (except for the economic
substance, which shall remain the same), including the conditions to closing
and the termination provisions contained herein, and (ii) amend  _Section
10.01(b)(i)_ to extend the End Date by the number of days elapsing between the
date hereof and the date when the notice described in _Section 11.06(a)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule_ is delivered to the Company. Prior to any
such amendment and restatement, the provisions of this Agreement will apply to
such Alternative Merger, _mutatis mutandis_.

 

  Section 11.07 _. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided
in  _Section 7.03_ , shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as expressly provided in
_Section 7.03_ , no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or

 

  84   
    

  liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

  (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in part, to (i) one or more of their wholly owned Subsidiaries at any
time, and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that, such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its
obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 

  Section 11.08 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State.

 

  Section 11.09 _. Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum; _provided_ that, any final judgment in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Process in
any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in  _Section 11.01_ shall be deemed effective service
of process on such party.

 

  Section 11.10 _. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

  Section 11.11 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party

 

  85   
    

  hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

  Section 11.12 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the

 

  Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and such
agreements supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to their subject matter.

 

  Section 11.13 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon any such determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

  Section 11.14 _. Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
