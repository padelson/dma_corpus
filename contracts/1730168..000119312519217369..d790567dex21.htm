such Proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (A)&nbsp;there exists a conflict of interest, as advised by outside counsel for the Indemnified Party, between the Indemnified

preceding sentence, in the circumstances where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the relevant Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in (but not control)

Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party Claim, and shall keep such Persons informed of all developments relating to any such Third-Party Claims, and

(A)&nbsp;applicable Law requires such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to restrict or prohibit the provision of such information (<I>provided</I> that such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law); (B)&nbsp;providing such information would breach any obligation of confidentiality to which a Party or any of its Subsidiaries may be subject (<I>provided</I> that such
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in
violation of such consent requirement); or (C)&nbsp;providing disclosure of any such information would reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other applicable privilege or protection (<I>provided</I> that
such Party and its affiliates shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss of such privilege
