certificate of title, deed, assignment or other agreement or instrument of
transfer (in a form that is consistent with the terms and conditions of

(vii) (A) from Seller and each Subsidiary of Seller that sells, transfers or

income tax purposes) any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities and that is a
"United States person" (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the

 



-25- 

    

 Code), a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, substantially in
the form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section

7701(a)(30) of the Code), a duly executed certificate to the effect that no
such asset is a "United States real property interest."

(c) The assignment, transfer or conveyance of the Purchased Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in non-U.S. jurisdictions contemplated
hereunder will be effective as of the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, to the extent that the transfer of any Purchased Assets
and/or Assumed Liabilities in any particular non-U.S. jurisdiction cannot be
completed at the Closing as a result of one or more Delayed Transfer
Conditions not being satisfied at such time in such non-U.S. jurisdiction as
of the Closing (including in respect of the Offer Employees in such
jurisdiction) (and with respect to the Delayed Transfer Conditions set forth
as item 1 or 3 on Annex 2.8, the satisfaction or waiver of which shall be
determined by Purchaser in its reasonable discretion), the Parties shall delay
the closing of the Transactions solely with respect to the transfer of the
Purchased Assets and/or Assumed Liabilities located in such non-U.S.
jurisdiction, the transfer of which are subject to such Delayed Transfer
Conditions, until such Delayed Transfer Conditions have been satisfied (or
waived by Purchaser with respect to the Delayed Transfer Conditions set forth
as item 1 or 3 on Annex 2.8) in such jurisdiction (such jurisdiction, a "
_Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction_ " and such delayed closing, a " _Delayed
Transfer Closing_ ") and Seller shall use all reasonable best efforts to
achieve the satisfaction of such requirements and to effect the Delayed
Transfer Closing as soon as practicable following the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the case of any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
legal interest in and to such Purchased Assets shall not be conveyed,
assigned, transferred or delivered to Purchaser, and the Assumed Liabilities
shall not be assumed by Purchaser, until the relevant Delayed Transfer Closing
occurs.

 

(d) To the extent applicable, from the Closing Date until the date on which
any Purchased Assets in a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction is transferred
pursuant to a Foreign Closing Document, (i) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
hold and (to the extent that Purchaser or its designee is unable to operate
such Purchased Assets in a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction) operate
such Purchased Assets in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, and subject to the instructions of the
Purchaser and its affiliates to the extent such instructions relate to the
Business or such Purchased Assets and do not require any action to be taken
in violation of applicable Law, and such Purchased Assets shall be so held and
operated for the sole benefit and sole detriment of Purchaser so that all
benefits and detriments attributable to such Purchased Assets in such Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction inure from and after the Closing solely to Purchaser;
and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller, its applicable
Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates harmless from and against all
Liabilities actually incurred as a result of Sellers or any such Subsidiarys
or their respective affiliates post-Closing direct or indirect ownership,
management or operation of any such Purchased Assets in such Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction (only to the extent that such Liabilities relate to the Business
and are (or would be) Assumed Liabilities hereunder).

 



-26- 

    

(e) In the event any of the Delayed Transfer Conditions exist at the time of
Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities in any
jurisdiction (including in respect of the Offer Employees in such
jurisdiction), the Parties shall (subject to the limitations otherwise set
forth in this Agreement) use their reasonable best efforts to promptly (i)
make such filings and obtain any such required consents or approvals, (ii)
resolve any such prohibitions under applicable Law, (iii) cause the expiration
of any such mandatory waiting periods and (iv) complete any such required
notifications or consultations in each case as is necessary for the Parties to
resolve the applicable Delayed Transfer Condition so that such Delayed
Transfer Condition shall no longer apply, and promptly execute, or cause to
be executed, the applicable Foreign Closing Document and transfer of the
related Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, including the Offer
Employees in such jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither Party shall have any obligation to agree to or offer any
payments, fees or concessions or any amendments to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents.

 

2.9 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate and, as applicable, to cause their
relevant Subsidiaries to allocate, the Purchase Price and any other items
that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Assumed Liability and any liabilities that, for
Tax purposes, are treated as assumed by the Purchaser (or its
relevant Subsidiaries)) among the Purchased Assets (and any assets that, for
Tax purposes, are treated as assets purchased by the Purchaser (or its
relevant Subsidiaries) pursuant to this Agreement) in accordance with _Exhibit
E_ attached hereto (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ").

(b) To the extent necessary to prepare bills of sale, transfer agreements, or
otherwise to timely comply with the requirements of applicable Law in respect
of the sale of any of the Purchased Assets, as soon as practicable (but no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing), Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a proposed preliminary allocation of the relevant portion of the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Assumed Liability and any liabilities that, for Tax purposes, are treated as
assumed by the Purchaser (or its relevant Subsidiaries)) among each applicable
member of the Seller Group that sells, transfers or assigns any relevant
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities (or is treated as selling,
transferring or assigning, for Tax purposes, any assets or liabilities to the
Purchaser (or its relevant Subsidiaries) pursuant to this Agreement)
determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule (the "
_Preliminary Allocation_ "). If Purchaser disagrees with any Preliminary
Allocation, Purchaser may, within ten (10) days after delivery of such
Preliminary Allocation, deliver a notice to Seller to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers
proposed allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall, during the ten (10) days
following such delivery cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute prior
to the Closing.

 

(c) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items
that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Assumed Liability and any liabilities that, for
Tax purposes, are treated as assumed by the Purchaser (or its
relevant Subsidiaries)) among each applicable member of the Seller Group that
sells, transfers or assigns any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities (or is
treated as selling, transferring or assigning, for Tax purposes, any assets or
liabilities to the Purchaser (or its relevant Subsidiaries)

 



-27- 

    

 pursuant to this Agreement) and further among the Purchased Assets (and any
assets that, for Tax purposes, are treated as assets purchased by the
Purchaser (or its relevant Subsidiaries) pursuant to this Agreement)
determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule, Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other
relevant provision of applicable Tax Law (" _Seller_ __ _s Allocation_ ").
If Purchaser disagrees with Sellers Allocation, Purchaser may, within thirty
(30) days after delivery of Sellers Allocation, deliver a notice ("
_Purchaser_ __ _s Allocation Notice_ ") to Seller to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers
proposed allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days
following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes. If Seller and Purchaser are unable
to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually selected by Seller and
Purchaser (" _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), who shall be promptly engaged,
to resolve any remaining disputes. All fees and expenses relating to the work,
if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Seller and Purchaser. Any allocation of the Purchase Price and any
other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
incorporate, reflect, and be consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The
allocation, as prepared by Seller if no Purchasers Allocation Notice has been
given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and Purchaser, or
as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Section 2.9(c) (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties absent manifest error. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary,
to reflect any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price and any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes. Seller
and Purchaser agree (and agree to cause their respective Subsidiaries) to
prepare and file all relevant federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in
accordance with the Allocation. In the event that the Allocation is disputed
by any Taxing Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute shall
promptly notify the other Party in writing of such notice and resolution of
the dispute.

 

2.10 _Non-Assignment_ _; Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey or
deliver any Purchased Asset if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery thereof would be prohibited by Law or would, without
the approval, authorization or consent of, filing with, notification to, or
granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver or permit by, any third
party or Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Approvals_ "), (i) constitute a
breach or other contravention thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable,
or (iii) adversely affect, in any material respect, the rights thereunder of
Seller, its Subsidiaries, Purchaser, or any of their respective officers,
directors, agents or affiliates, unless and until such Approval is obtained.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any Approval
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agreements of Governmental
Entities to novate applicable Business Contracts and enter into new Contracts
with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries) (other than regulatory approvals under
Antitrust Laws, which shall be governed by Section 5.1) (collectively, "
_Non-Regulatory Approvals_") required to sell, assign, transfer, convey or
deliver the Purchased Assets 

 



-28- 

    

 to Purchaser or its designated Subsidiary at the Closing, and Purchaser
shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller and its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith. If such Non-Regulatory Approval is not obtained prior to
Closing, then, until the earliest of (x) such time as such Non-Regulatory
Approval is obtained, (y) nine (9) months following the Closing Date (other
than for a Purchased Asset that is a Business Government Contract, for which
such date shall be two (2) years following the Closing Date) and (z) with
respect to a Purchased Asset that is a Contract, the expiration of the term
of such Contract in accordance with its current term or the execution of a
replacement Contract by Purchaser or its Subsidiary, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to
be obtained, such Non-Regulatory Approval, and Purchaser shall provide
reasonable cooperation to Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith.
From and after the Closing until the earlier of (x) such time as such Non-
Regulatory Approval is obtained for the assignment of the applicable Purchased
Asset and (y) with respect to a Purchased Asset that is a Contract, the
expiration of the term of such Contract in accordance with its current term
or the execution of a replacement Contract by Purchaser or its Subsidiary, the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective controlled affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to enter into or otherwise implement arrangements
(including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) (in each case to the
extent permitted and practicable) that (x) provides Purchaser or its
designated Subsidiary the claims, rights, remedies and benefits of any such
Purchased Assets, (y) causes Seller and its Subsidiaries to enforce, at
Purchasers request, any claims, rights, remedies and benefits of any such
Purchased Assets solely for the benefit of Purchaser, and (z)
causes Purchaser to assume, bear and, if permitted, perform all Assumed
Liabilities (for the avoidance of doubt, including any Liabilities that would
be Assumed Liabilities if the applicable Non-Regulatory Approval was obtained
with respect thereto) thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement. In the event Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is unable to
perform the Assumed Liabilities described in clause (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence and Seller or its Subsidiaries is able to so
perform, Seller agrees to perform such Assumed Liabilities on Purchasers
behalf and at its direction and, subject to Sellers compliance with
Purchasers directions, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for all costs,
expenses and other Liabilities to the extent arising from or related to such
performance that would otherwise be Assumed Liabilities hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, such Assumed Liabilities will include all obligations
under such Business Contracts (if and to the extent related to the Business)
with respect to the completion of any work, or provision of goods and services
thereunder, or warranties, contractual commitments or other Liabilities
thereunder or any breach thereof, any indemnity and service obligations
thereof, and any maintenance and support obligations thereof, but in each case
excluding any Retained Liability or any Liability resulting from Sellers
failure to comply with Purchasers directions with respect thereto. Upon
obtaining the relevant Non-Regulatory Approval, Seller hereby assigns, and
shall, and shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, promptly sell,
convey, assign, transfer and deliver, to Purchaser or its designated
Subsidiary such Purchased Asset for no additional consideration (other than
assumption of any related Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto), and
Purchaser shall promptly assume such related Assumed Liability.

(c) All reasonable and documented third party legal and administrative fees,
and other similar costs and expenses, agreed and payable by Seller or its
controlled affiliates in connection with obtaining Non-Regulatory Approvals
under Section 2.10(b) shall be borne by Seller (provided that Purchaser shall
bear all costs of its cooperation thereunder). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall

 



-29- 

    

 have any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to pay any consent,
approval or waiver fee, discount, rebate or any money or other consideration
beyond administrative costs or _ _ immaterial review charges, or provide any
additional security (including any guaranty) to any Person in order to obtain
any Non-Regulatory Approvals, unless Purchaser requests and reimburses or
indemnifies Seller for such payment or security.

(d) Any Primary Shared Contract shall be assigned, transferred, conveyed and
delivered in its entirety to Purchaser, if so assignable, transferrable or
conveyable and any Non-Primary Shared Contract shall be assigned, transferred,
conveyed and delivered to Purchaser only in part and only to the extent such
part relates to the Business if such part is so assignable, transferrable or
conveyable; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any Person be
required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part
(as applicable), any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be
amended) by its terms without obtaining one or more Approvals, (ii) Seller
shall be entitled to amend or modify such Shared Contract prior to Closing to
separate out any portions thereof that do not relate to the Business
(provided such amendments or modifications do not adversely affect the rights,
obligations or remedies thereunder with respect to the Business), and (iii) if
any Shared Contract cannot be so assigned (in whole or in part (as
applicable)) by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended, without such
Approval or Approvals then, as from the Closing until such time as such
Approval or Approvals are obtained or until the earlier expiration of such
Shared Contract in accordance with its terms, Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser, and each Party will use reasonable best efforts, to establish an
agency or other similar arrangement (including through subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
Purchaser (in each case to the extent permitted and practicable) that (x)
provides Purchaser the claims, rights and benefits of those parts of such
Shared Contract that relate to the Business, (y) causes Seller and its
Subsidiaries to enforce, at Purchasers request, any claims, rights, remedies
and benefits of any such Shared Contract solely for the benefit of Purchaser
(in each case to the extent related to the Business) and (z) causes Purchaser
to bear and, if permitted, perform all Assumed Liabilities (for the avoidance
of doubt, including any Liabilities that would be Assumed Liabilities if the
applicable Approval was obtained with respect thereto) thereunder to the
extent related to the Business from and after the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement. In the event Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is unable to
perform the Assumed Liabilities described in clause (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence and Seller or its Subsidiaries is able to so perform,
Seller agrees to perform such Assumed Liabilities on Purchasers behalf and at
its direction and Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for all costs, expenses
and other Liabilities to the extent arising from or related to such
performance that would otherwise be Assumed Liabilities hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, such Assumed Liabilities will include all obligations
under such Business Contracts (if and to the extent related to the Business)
with respect to the completion of any work, or provision of goods and services
thereunder, or warranties, contractual commitments or other Liabilities
thereunder or any breach thereof, any indemnity and service obligations
thereof, and any maintenance and support obligations thereof, but in each case
excluding any Retained Liability or any Liability resulting from Sellers
failure to comply with Purchasers directions with respect thereto.

(e) If a Primary Shared Contract that is not amended or modified prior to
Closing to separate out any portions thereof that relate to the Retained
Business has been assigned, transferred or conveyed to Purchaser or its
designated Subsidiary in its entirety, Purchaser shall, or shall cause such
Subsidiary to, upon Sellers written request, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver to Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller designated by Seller the portion
of such

 



-30- 

    

 Primary Shared Contract that relates to the Retained Business, if such
portion is so assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately amend
such Primary Shared Contract after the Closing, so that Seller or a
Subsidiary of Seller designated by Seller shall be entitled to the rights and
benefit of those parts of such Primary Shared Contract that relates to the
Retained Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any
Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part,
any Primary Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by
its terms without obtaining one or more Approvals and (ii) if any Primary
Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or
cannot be amended, without such Approval or Approvals then, as from the
Closing until such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained or until
the earlier expiration of such Primary Shared Contract in accordance with its
terms, Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, and each Party will use
reasonable best efforts, to establish an agency or other similar arrangement
(including through subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser (in each case to the extent permitted and
practicable) that (x) provides Seller the claims, rights and benefits of those
parts of such Primary Shared Contract that do not relate to the Business, (y)
causes Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to enforce, at Sellers request, any
claims, rights, remedies and benefits of any such Primary Shared Contract
solely for the benefit of Seller (in each case to the extent related to the
Retained Business) and (z) cause Seller to bear and perform all Liabilities
(for the avoidance of doubt, including any Liabilities that would be Retained
Liabilities if the applicable Approval was obtained with respect thereto)
thereunder (to the extent related to the Retained Business) from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement. Seller agrees to perform such
Liabilities and Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for all costs, expenses and
other Liabilities to the extent arising from or related to such performance
that would otherwise be Retained Liabilities hereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, such Retained Liabilities will include all obligations under such
Contracts (if and to the extent related to the Retained Business) with
respect to the completion of any work, or provision of goods and services
thereunder, or warranties, contractual commitments or other Liabilities
thereunder or any breach thereof, any indemnity and service obligations
thereof, and any maintenance and support obligations thereof.

(f) Following the Closing, for so long as Seller and its Subsidiaries hold
any Purchased Assets or are parties to any Business Contracts or Shared
Contracts and provide Purchaser or any of its controlled affiliates any
claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased Asset or Shared Contract
pursuant to an arrangement described in Section 2.10(b) or Section 2.10(d),
(i) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall hold and operate such Purchased Assets
and operate under such Contracts in a manner consistent in all material
respects with the manner in which Seller and its Subsidiaries hold and
operate their other assets and operate under their other Contracts, subject to
the reasonable instructions of the Purchaser and its affiliates to the extent
such instructions relate to the part of the Primary Shared Contract related
to the Business, (ii) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall provide Purchaser with
all of the benefits (including monies paid) with respect to such Purchased
Assets and such Contracts (to the extent related to the Business) and (iii)
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller, its applicable Subsidiaries and
their respective affiliates harmless from and against all Covered Losses
incurred as a result of Sellers or any such Subsidiaries or their respective
affiliates post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation
of any such Purchased Assets or Shared Contracts (only to the extent that such
Covered Losses relate to the Business and are (or would be)
Assumed Liabilities hereunder) other than any Liability resulting from
Sellers failure to comply with Purchasers instructions with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any transfer or
assignment to Purchaser of any Purchased Asset or any part of a Shared
Contract that shall require an Approval as described above in this Section
2.10 shall be made subject to such Approval being obtained.

 



-31- 

    

(g) Following the Closing, for so long as Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
are parties to any Primary Shared Contracts and provide Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries any claims, rights and benefits of any such Primary Shared
Contract pursuant to an arrangement described in Section 2.10(e), (i)
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall operate under such Primary Shared
Contracts in a manner consistent in all material respects with the manner in
which Purchaser and its Subsidiaries operate under their other Contracts,
subject to the reasonable instructions of the Purchaser and its affiliates to
the extent such instructions relate to the part of the Primary Shared Contract
not related to the Business, (ii) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall provide
Seller with all of the benefits (including monies paid) with respect to such
Contracts (to the extent related to the Retained Business), and (iii) Seller
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser, its applicable Subsidiaries and their
respective controlled affiliates harmless from and against all Covered
Losses incurred as a result of Purchasers post-Closing direct or indirect
ownership, management or operation of any such Shared Contracts (only to the
extent that such Covered Losses relate to the Retained Business) other than
any Liability resulting from Purchasers failure to comply with Sellers
instructions with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, any transfer or assignment to Seller of any part of a Shared
Contract that shall require an Approval as described above in this Section
2.10 shall be made subject to such Approval being obtained.

(h) Prior to the Closing, to the extent Purchaser designates certain
Contracts as Excluded Assets pursuant to Section 2.5(p) (" _Designated
Contracts_ "), Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate to inform the
counterparties to such Designated Contracts that the Business is being
transferred to Purchaser and use reasonable best efforts to encourage such
counterparty to enter into new Contracts with the Purchaser or a designated
Subsidiary thereof (on terms satisfactory to Purchaser in its
sole discretion, and to be effective no earlier than the Closing) to replace
such Designated Contract; _provided_ that neither Party shall have any
obligation to agree to or offer any payments, fees or concessions in
connection with such efforts. 

(i) Prior to, and for a period of six (6) months after, the Closing, if and to
the extent requested by Purchaser, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
to assign, transfer or convey to Purchaser (or its designated Subsidiary) the
portion (and only the portion) of the leases set forth on Section 2.10(i) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _SOC Leases_ ") to the extent covering
the "Security Operations Centers" of the Business (the " _SOC Space_ ")
located on the leased properties covered by such SOC Leases, including by way
of (1) novating such portion of the SOC Leases and allowing Purchaser or its
designated Subsidiary to enter into a new lease for such SOC Spaces, or (2) if
Seller and Purchaser are unable to obtain landlord approval (" _Landlord
Approval_ ") for such novation and new lease, by granting a sublease of such
SOC Space to Purchaser (or a designated Subsidiary of Purchaser) on terms to
be agreed by the Parties acting in good faith and reasonably (with rent for
the applicable sublease being determined on a pro rata basis based on the
square footage of the applicable SOC Space as compared to the remainder of
Sellers or Subsidiaries use of the applicable leased properties covered by
such applicable SOC Leases), in each case subject to required
Approvals. Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller and its
Subsidiaries in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 2.10(i), neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any 

 



-32- 

    

 obligation under this Section 2.10(i) to pay any consent, approval or waiver
fee, discount, rebate or any money or other consideration beyond
administrative costs or __ immaterial review charges, or provide any
additional security (including any guaranty) to any Person in order to obtain
such Approvals, unless Purchaser requests and reimburses or indemnifies Seller
for such payment or security.

 

2.11 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made. Each of Seller and Purchaser,
and their respective Subsidiaries, shall cooperate in good faith to take all
reasonable measures that are available to it in accordance with Law to
minimize any withholding Taxes that may be applied to any amounts payable
under this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties shall (a)
cooperate in good faith to identify jurisdictions that may trigger withholding
taxes under this Section 2.11, and (b) consult with each other in good faith
as to the nature of such withholding Taxes so identified (including the basis
upon which such withholding is required) and as to any such reasonable
measures that are available. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Seller if
it determines that any withholding is required under applicable Law no later
than twenty (20) days prior to the making of the relevant payment described in
this Section 2.11. In the event that Purchaser determines to
designate, pursuant to Section 2.3, a Subsidiary organized or tax resident in
a jurisdiction other than the United States, Switzerland or Singapore to
acquire intangible property from a member of the Seller Group, Purchaser shall
notify Seller of such decision as soon as reasonably practicable (but no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing); _provided_ that the
foregoing notice will not be required as to the designation of a Subsidiary to
purchase intangible property from a member of the Seller Group that is
organized or tax resident in the same country as such purchasing Subsidiary.

2.12 _French Assets; French Liabilities_.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, under French labor Laws, Symantec
(France) SAS will, and Seller will cause Symantec (France) SAS to, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, consult with and inform its
competent works council (the " _French_ ___Works_ __ ___Council_ " and such
process of informing and consulting, the " _French Consultation_ ___Process_
") with respect to the offer made by Purchaser to acquire any Purchased Assets
located in France (collectively, the " _French_ _ _ _Assets_ ") and to assume
any Assumed Liabilities located in France (collectively, the " _French_
___Liabilities_ "), with the view to completing the French Consultation
Process with the French Works Council by way of one of the following (any of
the events in clause (i) through (iv) having occurred, the " _Completion of
the French Consultation Process_ "): (i) an opinion issued by the French
Works Council and confirmed in writing; (ii) if the minutes of the meeting
during which an opinion described in clause (i) was issued have not been
approved by the members of the French Works Council within five (5) business
days from the date of such meeting, a written statement of the president of
the French Works Council confirming that the opinion was issued; (iii) the
expiration of the maximum period available under applicable Law for the French
Works Council to issue its opinion, if applicable; or (iv) a decision of the
relevant Governmental Entity that the French Consultation

 



-33- 

    

 Process has been completed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, unless and until Symantec (France) SAS has
executed and delivered to Purchaser a duly executed French Acceptance Notice
pursuant to and in accordance with the French Offer Letter: (i) the provisions
of this Article II (and only this Article II but excluding this Section 2.12)
shall not be effective with respect to the French Assets or the French
Liabilities; (ii) for the purposes of this Article II (and only this Article
II but excluding this Section 2.12) the French Assets shall not be considered
Purchased Assets; (iii) for the purpose of this Article II (and only this
Article II but excluding this Section 2.12) the French Liabilities shall not
be considered Assumed Liabilities; and (iv) the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the French Purchase Price.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that,
for the purpose of Section 5.2, Section 5.4 and Section 5.15, the French
Assets and French Liabilities shall be deemed to be included in the Business
and the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of the date hereof, and
that the Asset Selection Cut-Off Time with respect to the French Assets shall
be deemed to be extended until five (5) business days after the Completion of
the French Consultation Process.

 

(c) On the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Letter attached as
___Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _French Offer Letter_ "), including the price
specified therein (the " _French Purchase Price_ "), Purchaser has irrevocably
offered to acquire the French Assets and assume the French Liabilities subject
to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that
Symantec (France) SAS delivers to Purchaser, following Completion of the
French Consultation Process, a duly executed Acceptance Notice, attached as
Annex A to the French Offer Letter (the " _French Acceptance Notice_ "),
pursuant to and in accordance with the French Offer Letter, (i) all the
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations, warranties,
indemnities or covenants contained herein) shall be effective with respect
to the French Assets and the French Liabilities as of the date hereof, (ii)
the French Assets shall be included in the Purchased Assets and the French
Liabilities shall be included in the Assumed Liabilities and the Business
shall include the French Assets and French Liabilities, and (iii) the
Purchase Price shall no longer be reduced by the French Purchase Price (it
being understood that the Purchase Price assumes delivery of the French
Acceptance Notice and therefore already includes the French Purchase Price).

(d) From and after the date Seller receives the French Offer Letter, Seller
shall convene the French Works Council to a meeting or meetings and use
reasonable best efforts to carry out the French Consultation Process in
compliance with applicable Law. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
keep Purchaser apprised of the status of the French Consultation Process and
provide Purchaser with copies of any relevant documents or materials prepared
for the attention of, or issued by, the French Works Council in connection
with the French Consultation Process, including copies of the minutes of the
meetings where the French Works Councils opinions are delivered.

Except as disclosed in (x) any forms, statements, documents and reports filed
or furnished by Seller with the SEC on or after March 31, 2018 and publicly
available prior to the date hereof (including exhibits and other information
incorporated by reference therein but excluding any predictive, cautionary or
forward looking disclosures contained under the captions 

 



-34- 

    

 "risk factors," "forward looking statements" or any similar precautionary
sections and any other disclosures contained therein that are predictive,
cautionary or forward looking in nature) (such forms, statements, documents
and reports, the " _Seller SEC Documents_ ") or (y) the applicable section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any
information set forth in one section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the representation and warranty
set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and, whether or
not an explicit reference or cross-reference is made, each other
representation and warranty set forth in this Article III for which it is
reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant to such
other section), Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as set forth
below:

3.1 _Qualification,_ _Organization_ _, Subsidiaries, etc_ _._

 

(a) Seller is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets relating to the Business and to carry on the Business as
presently conducted. Seller is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties relating to
the Business or conduct of the Business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or, where relevant, in good standing,

Documents as amended to the date hereof. Sellers Organizational Documents are
in full force and effect and Seller is not in violation of its Organizational
Documents.

 

(b) Each of Sellers Subsidiaries holding any Purchased Assets is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and, where such concept is

individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect and (ii)
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by the board of directors of Seller (the " _Seller
Board of Directors_ ") and no other corporate proceedings (pursuant to
Sellers Organizational Documents or otherwise) on the part of Seller are
necessary to authorize the consummation of, and to consummate, the
Transactions. On or prior to the date hereof, the Seller Board of Directors
has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Seller and its
stockholders (the " _Seller Stockholders_ ") and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement, and (ii) approved the execution and delivery by
Seller of this Agreement, the performance by Seller of its covenants and
agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Transactions upon the

actions by the Seller Board of Directors have been rescinded or modified in
any way. No approval of the Seller Stockholders is necessary or required,
under applicable Law or otherwise, for the consummation by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries of the Transactions. Seller has no Knowledge, as of the date
of this Agreement, of any facts or circumstances (including any Laws or
contractual provisions) that would prohibit either Seller or Purchaser from
complying with its respective obligations under Annex 5.18.

 

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller
or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, assuming this

subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought (collectively, the " _Enforceability
Limitations_ "). Upon the execution and delivery by any member of the Seller
Group of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties
thereto, such other Transaction Documents will constitute the valid and
binding obligations of such member of the Seller Group, enforceable against
such member of the Seller Group in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations.

 

3.3 _Governmental Consents; No Violation_.

 

(a) Other than in connection with or in compliance with the HSR Act and other
requisite clearances or approvals under other applicable requirements of
other Antitrust Laws, no authorization, permit, notification to, consent or
approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary or required,
under applicable Law, for the consummation by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries of the Transactions, except for such authorizations,
permits, notifications, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained
or made, would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, (A) a Business Material Adverse Effect or (B) a material
adverse effect on the ability of Seller to consummate the Transactions prior

compliance with the provisions hereof by Seller and its Subsidiaries will
not, (i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of, or default or
change of control (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, modification,
cancellation, first offer, first refusal or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under any Contract relating to the Business binding
upon the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of them are a
party or by or to which any of the Purchased Assets or Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries are bound or subject or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the Purchased Assets, other than Permitted Liens, (ii) conflict with or
result in any violation of (A) any provision of the Sellers Organizational
Documents or (B) any provision of the Organizational Documents of any of

Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities by
or before any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected (a) to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business or (b) to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of
Seller and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Transactions prior to the
Outside Date. There are no orders, judgments or decrees of or settlement
agreements with any Governmental Entity relating to the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that would reasonably be expected
(x) to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business or (y)
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
ability of Seller and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Transactions
prior to the Outside Date. To the Knowledge of Seller, Section 2.7(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter contains all claims, investigations or other
Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Business.

3.10 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) With respect to the Transferred Registered Intellectual Property, Section
1.1(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, (i) the application or registration number, title, owners or
registrants and the jurisdiction of filing or application and (ii) the status
of such items listed thereon. All necessary documents and
certificates currently due for filing as of the date hereof in connection
with any such Transferred Registered Intellectual Property have been filed
with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or

 



-44- 

    

 other authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case
may be, for the purposes of maintaining such Transferred Registered
Intellectual Property. Seller has used reasonable best efforts and acted in
good faith to identify in Section 1.1(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter all
Registered Intellectual Property of Seller primarily used or primarily held
for use in the Business, including all Patents and Patent applications that
relate primarily to the Business or the Business Products using the
methodology set forth on Annex 3.10(a) attached hereto.

 

(b) Each item of Transferred Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting
and, to Sellers Knowledge, is not invalid or unenforceable. No Proceeding to
which Seller or one of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than office actions
in connection with the application for, or prosecution of, any Transferred
Registered Intellectual Property) is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened, by or before any Governmental Entity, that challenges the
legality, validity, enforceability, registration, use or ownership of any
Transferred Registered Intellectual Property or other material Transferred
Intellectual Property, or that challenges the ownership or use of any
material Transferred Technology.

(c) Seller or one of its Subsidiaries exclusively owns all Transferred
Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Liens and subject to the foregoing, all such Transferred Intellectual Property
Rights are, and immediately following the Closing will be, fully
transferable, alienable licensable and, to Sellers Knowledge, enforceable by
the Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary without restriction and without
material payment of any kind to any third Person; in each case, except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted or transferred (or is obligated to grant or transfer) to any Person or
has permitted (or is obligated to permit) any Person to retain any ownership
interest, including any joint ownership interest, or any exclusive rights in,
any Transferred Intellectual Property Rights material to the conduct of the
Business. No Governmental Entity or educational institution has, as a result
of funding provided by such Governmental Entity or educational institution,
obtained any right to any Intellectual Property Rights material to the conduct
of the Business. For clarity, payment from a Governmental Entity or
educational institution to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in consideration
for purchase of, non-exclusive license to, or subscription to the Business
Products will not be deemed "funding" under this Section 3.10(c).

(d) No Proceedings are pending, and, to Sellers Knowledge, no Proceeding is
threatened against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging that any part
of the Business or the Business Products are infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Business. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business,
(i) neither any Business Product (when used by or as authorized by
Seller) nor the conduct of the Business, as conducted at any time on or after
April 2, 2016, has infringed, violated, or misappropriated any Intellectual
Property Rights of any Person or constituted unfair competition or unfair
trade practices, (ii) to Sellers Knowledge, no Person is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting, using in an unauthorized manner or otherwise
violating any rights in respect of Transferred Intellectual Property Rights
and (iii) since April 2, 2016, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
instituted or threatened in writing to institute any Proceeding against any
Person alleging such Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, using
in an unauthorized manner or otherwise violating any Transferred Intellectual
Property Rights.

 



-45- 

    

(e) In each case in which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged or
hired an employee, consultant or contractor who develops or creates Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries any Business Product or material Transferred
Technology, Seller or such Subsidiary has obtained, either by operation of Law
or by valid assignment or transfer exclusive ownership of all Intellectual
Property Rights in such Transferred Technology or Business Product, except
where the absence of that assignment or transfer would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business.
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions
to maintain (and continue to maintain), as confidential, and to reasonably
protect, all Trade Secrets relating to the Business, except (i) where Seller
or one or more of its Subsidiaries has made a reasonable business decision to
no longer maintain a particular item of information or Technology as a Trade
Secret, or (ii) except as would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business. To Sellers
Knowledge, there has been no unauthorized disclosure or use of, or access to,
Transferred Technology, information or materials that Seller maintains or
intended to maintain as a Trade Secret relating to the Business, except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 3.10(e), each employee of, or
consultant or contractor to, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has executed a
valid and binding agreement (i) if such individual has developed or created
for Seller or any of its Subsidiaries any element of a Business Product or any
other material Transferred Technology, assigning to Seller or the relevant
Subsidiary of Seller all Intellectual Property Rights (except as limited by
applicable Law) created by, or that arise as a result of the work of such
employee of, or consultant or contractor to, Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) requiring such employee, consultant or contractor to
maintain as confidential all confidential information and Trade Secrets of
Seller or its Subsidiaries relating to the Business (including confidential
information or Trade Secrets disclosed to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
by a third Person), except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business.

 

(g) Except as has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business, neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed any Software or database under an
Open Source License in a manner that would require any Transferred Technology
(i) to be disclosed or distributed in Source Code form, (ii) to be
licensed for purposes of preparing derivative works or (iii) to be
redistributed at no charge. Seller and its Subsidiaries are and have been in
compliance with all Open Source Licenses to which they are subject except
where a failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business.

(h) Section 3.10(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of, and Seller has made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of all material Business Contracts pursuant to which Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) grants any license, covenant not to assert, release,
agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or other immunity to any Person under
or to any Transferred Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) is granted a
license, covenant not to assert, release, agreement not to enforce
or prosecute, or immunity to or under, any Persons Intellectual Property
Rights that, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, is not (A) a
Material Customer Agreement, (B) a Material Supplier Agreement, (C)
a Material Reseller Agreement, (D) a Material Distributor Agreement, (E) a
Material Government Entity Customer Agreement, (F) a Non-Scheduled License or
(G) material to the Business (the foregoing, the " _IP Contracts_ ").

 



-46- 

    

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Business, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will result in (i) a
breach, violation, modification, cancellation, termination, or suspension of
any IP Contract, (ii) the release of any Source Code included in the
Transferred Technology or (iii) the grant (or requirement to grant) to any
Person of any license, covenant not to assert, release, agreement not to
enforce or prosecute, or other immunity to or under any Transferred
Intellectual Property Rights. To Sellers Knowledge, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will, by
the express terms of any Contracts to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party (but to which Purchaser and its affiliates are not) result in the
grant (or requirement to grant) to any Person of any license, covenant not to
assert, release, agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or other immunity
by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Intellectual Property Rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. Except
as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business, (1) all IP Contracts shall remain in full force and
effect following the Closing in accordance with their terms (other than
terminations or expirations occurring in the ordinary course of business) and
(2) immediately after the Closing, Purchaser will be entitled to exercise all
of Sellers or its applicable Subsidiaries respective rights under all IP
Contracts to the same extent as prior to the Closing.

 

3.11 _Privacy and Data Protection_.

 

(a) Since April 2, 2016, except as has not been and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business,
(i) Sellers and each of its Subsidiaries receipt, collection, monitoring,
maintenance, hosting, creation, transmission, use, analysis, disclosure,
storage, disposal and security, as the case may be, of Protected Information
and, to Sellers Knowledge, any such activities performed or handled by
authorized third parties on Sellers or one of its Subsidiarys behalf, in
each case in connection with or relating to the Business, have complied with,
and (ii) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will result in Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, following the Closing, Purchaser, so long as the Protected
Information is used in substantially the same manner as it is currently used
in the Business, being in breach or violation of, (A) provisions governing
privacy, data protection, or information security matters in any Business
Contracts, (B) applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws, (C) all
applicable policies and procedures adopted by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to privacy, data protection, or information security
with respect to Protected Information, including the Privacy Statements and
such policies and procedures relating to access control, vulnerability
management, incident response and overall network security and/or (D) all
applicable consents, authorizations and privacy choices (including opt-out
decisions) that apply to Protected Information that have been obtained by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as has not been and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Business, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries has all rights, authority,
consents and authorizations necessary to receive, access, use and disclose the
Protected Information in their possession or under their control
in connection with the operation of the Business as presently conducted.

all permits and licenses, and has made all governmental filings, required
under applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws to process, use, and
transfer Protected Information in connection with or relating to the
Business, and (ii) the consummation of the Transactions will neither
invalidate such permits and licenses nor require such permits and licenses to
be amended under applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws.

(c) Except as has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Business, neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries sells or rents to third parties any Protected
Information for monetary or other valuable consideration, in each case
excluding sale, rental or disclosures of Protected Information to (i)
Purchaser and any Person to whom Purchaser sells, rents or discloses
Protected Information, (ii) the customers of the Business in Sellers or its
Subsidiaries provision of Business Products to the customers of the Business
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (iii)
Sellers or its Subsidiaries service providers when such disclosure is made
for the purpose of the service providers provision of services to Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with or relating to the
Business.

(d) Since April 2, 2016, to Sellers Knowledge, except as has not been and
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business, there has been no (i) data security breach of,
unauthorized access to, or malicious disruption of any Business Products or
any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries systems, networks or information
technology that transmits or maintains Protected Information or other
confidential information in connection with or relating to the Business,

or disclosure of any Protected Information owned, used, hosted, maintained or
controlled by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection

a breach for which notification by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to

required under any Information Privacy and Security Laws applicable to the
Business or Business Contracts to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party. To Sellers Knowledge, since April 2, 2016, except as has not been and
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Business, none of the Businesss vendors, suppliers and
subcontractors, have (i) suffered any security breach that resulted in any
unauthorized access to or use of any Protected Information in the possession,
custody, or control of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) breached any
obligations relating to Protected Information in Contracts with Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) violated any Information Privacy and Security
Laws.

(e) Seller maintains and implements a reasonably appropriate written
information security program covering any part of the Business designed to (i)
identify and address internal and external risks to the security of any
proprietary or confidential information in the possession of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, including Protected Information, (ii) implement, monitor and
improve reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
control these risks and (iii) maintain notification procedures in compliance
in all material respects with applicable Information Privacy and Security Laws
that require notification to any Person in the case of any breach of security

written complaint or claim against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
commenced any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitration
body against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, with respect to

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

 

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as set forth below.

 

4.1 _Qualification,_ _Organization_ _, etc._ Purchaser is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted. Purchaser is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so qualified or, where relevant, in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions
prior to the Outside Date. Purchaser has filed with the SEC, prior to the
date hereof, a complete and accurate copy of its Organizational Documents.
Purchasers Organizational Documents are in full force and effect and
Purchaser is not in violation of its Organizational Documents.

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Purchaser and
no other corporate proceedings (pursuant to the Purchaser Governing
Documents or otherwise) on the part of Purchaser are necessary to authorize
the consummation of, and to consummate, the Transactions.

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Seller, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations.

4.3 _Governmental Consents; No Violation_.

 

(a) Other than in connection with or in compliance with the HSR Act and any
other requisite clearances or approvals under any other
applicable requirements of other Antitrust Laws, no authorization, permit,
notification to, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is necessary or required, under applicable Law, for the consummation by
Purchaser of the Transactions, except for such authorizations, permits,
notifications, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made,
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date.

(b) The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement, and
the execution and delivery by Purchaser of each other Transaction Document to
which it is or will be a party does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof by Purchaser will not,
(i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of, or default or
change of control (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, modification,
cancellation, first offer, first refusal or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under any Contract binding upon Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or to which any of them is a party or by which or to which
any of their respective properties, rights or assets are bound or subject, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, rights or
assets of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens,
(ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of (A)
Purchasers Organizational Documents or (B) the organizational documents of
any Subsidiary of Purchaser or (iii) conflict with or violate any Laws
applicable to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser or any of
their respective properties, rights or assets, other than in the case of
clauses (i), (ii)(B) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default,
termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to consummate
the Transactions prior to the Outside Date.

 

4.4 _Litigation; Orders_. As of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings
pending or, to Purchasers Knowledge, threatened against Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, rights or assets by or
before any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date. There are
no orders, judgments or decrees of or settlement agreements with any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside Date.

 



-57- 

    

4.5 _Financial Ability to Perform_.

 

(a) Purchaser has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of (i) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Purchaser and
the financial institutions party thereto including all exhibits, schedules and
annexes to such letter in effect as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and (ii) the executed fee letter related thereto (together, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ", and, subject to the last sentence of Section
5.17(g), the provision of funds as set forth therein, the " _Financing_ ") (it
being understood that such fee letter has been redacted to remove fees, the
rates and amounts in the "market flex", if any, and other terms that would not
adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of
the Financing). As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, other
than the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or other written
agreements, contracts or arrangements that impose conditions or other
contingencies related to, or that would reasonably otherwise affect, the
funding of the full amount of the Financing. As of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, there are no conditions or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter. The commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter represents (A) a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Purchaser and (B) to Purchasers Knowledge, a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of each other party thereto, in the case of each of
clauses (A) and (B), except as may be limited by the Enforceability
Limitations. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, or compliance with any of the terms waived, and (ii) no commitment
under the Debt Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect. Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and will fully pay (or cause to be paid) any such amounts
due on or before the Closing. As of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default
on the part of Purchaser or, to Purchasers Knowledge, any other party to the
Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
funding set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a
timely basis, nor does Purchaser have Knowledge, as of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be available to
Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2, the proceeds of the Financing, if funded, together with
available cash and other lines of credit of Purchaser, shall constitute
sufficient funds for Purchaser to enable Purchaser to deliver the Purchase
Price to Seller at the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to
effect the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not conditioned upon the availability to Purchaser or any of its
affiliates of any debt, equity or other financing in any amount whatsoever.

 



-58- 

    

4.6 _Finders and Brokers_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has
employed or engaged any investment banker, broker or finder in connection
with the Transactions who is entitled to any fee or any commission from Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or upon or as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions based on arrangements made by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.7 _No Other Representations_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Business by Purchaser, Purchaser has received and may
continue to receive from Seller certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan and cost-
related plan information, regarding Seller, its Subsidiaries and the Business.
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, with which Purchaser is familiar, and that, without
limiting in any respect any of the representations and warranties contained in
Article III, Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them. Accordingly, except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article III, Purchaser
acknowledges that neither Seller nor any Representative of Seller makes, and
Purchaser acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced
by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information
provided or made available to Purchaser in connection with the Transactions,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Purchaser or Purchasers Representatives in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions or the
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing, except, in each case for
the representations and warranties contained in Article III.

ARTICLE V

applicable Law to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (and in any event prior to the Outside Date), including (i)

to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside
Date), (B) make an appropriate filing with the European Commission with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and advisable after the
date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any

consents under such Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable after the date

necessary filings as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and
to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information
and documentary materials that may be requested under any Antitrust Laws and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods or obtain consents under such Antitrust Laws as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event prior to the Outside
Date). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to, and Seller shall
not and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to (in the case of Seller or
its Subsidiaries, solely with respect to the Business or any Purchased Asset
and unless expressly permitted by Section 5.2), without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (1) sell,
license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any
assets, business or portion of business of Seller, Purchaser or any Subsidiary

change the assets, the business or portion of the business of Seller,
Purchaser or any Subsidiary thereof or any of the foregoing in any manner or
(3) impose any such restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation

Subsidiary of any of the foregoing in any manner; _provided_ that if requested
by Purchaser, Seller or its Subsidiaries will become subject to, consent to
or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on Seller or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing occurs
and relates solely to the Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (1) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any Excluded Assets, (2)
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change in any manner the
Excluded Assets or the Retained Business or (3) impose any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of the Retained Business or

-60- 

    

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, in connection with and without
limiting the efforts referenced in Section 5.1(a) (but subject to the
limitations set forth therein) to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions and reasonably considering in good faith comments of the
other Party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by promptly providing
copies to the other Party of any such written communications, and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions and (iii)
permit the other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives
to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive
telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or other
applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings, substantive
telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC or other Governmental
Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials required to
be provided pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii) may be redacted (A)
to remove references concerning the valuation of Purchaser, Seller or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Retained Business or any portion thereof, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements existing as of the date hereof and (C) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _ _ that each of the Parties may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 5.1(b) as "Outside Counsel Only Material."
Without limiting Purchasers cooperation obligations described in Section
5.1(a) and this Section 5.1(b) (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchasers obligation to use reasonable best efforts to take all steps as may
be necessary, subject to the limitations in this Section 5.1, to obtain all
such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and
approvals as promptly as practicable after the date hereof), Purchaser will
control the ultimate strategy for securing approvals and expiration of
relevant waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws.

 

(c) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall enter into any transaction agreement
for, or consummate, an acquisition of a business that would, in each case,
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or materially
hindering or imposing any material delay in the satisfaction of the condition
to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(b).

 

5.2 _Conduct of Business_ _by Seller Pending the Closing_. Seller agrees that
between the date hereof and the earlier of the Closing or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, except
as set forth in Section 5.2 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as specifically
permitted or required by this Agreement, as required by applicable Law or as
consented to in writing by Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller (a) shall, and shall cause each of
its

5.4 _Access_ _; Confidentiality; Integration_ _Planning_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser and its Representatives (including its
Financing Parties) reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, to Sellers and its Subsidiaries offices,
properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records (in all cases to the
extent related to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities) and, during such period, Seller shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to
Purchaser and its Representatives all information (financial or otherwise)
concerning the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Business Employees as Purchaser may reasonably request (including information
for purposes of transition and integration planning or planning for possible
divestitures of any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities following the
Closing). In the event Purchaser desires to divest any Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities following the Closing, Purchaser shall be permitted to
provide, with prior written notice to Seller, information about such assets
or liabilities to potential purchasers thereof (and their representatives) so
long as (x) such potential purchasers are subject to a customary non-
disclosure agreement with Purchaser (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller), (y) Purchaser is directly responsible to Seller for
any breaches of such non-disclosure agreement and Seller shall be an express
third-party beneficiary of such non-disclosure agreement in order to enforce
such potential purchasers obligations thereunder and (z) promptly following
the valid termination of this Agreement (and in any event within twenty
four (24) hours), Purchaser shall request in writing that each such potential
purchaser promptly destroy or return to Seller all nonpublic information of
Seller furnished pursuant to such non-disclosure agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller shall not be required by this Section 5.4(a) to provide
Purchaser or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i)
that is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
hereof ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access
or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of
such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate
applicable Law ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of
which would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent
that does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to counsel for
Purchaser to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of obtaining
required approvals or consents, or making filings or providing notices,
subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense agreement in
customary form. Each Party will cooperate to minimize to the extent
reasonably practicable any unnecessary disruption to the businesses of Seller
and its Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder. Any access to any properties or facilities of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to Sellers reasonable security
measures and shall not include the right to perform any "invasive" testing or
soil, air or groundwater sampling, including, without limitation, any Phase I
or Phase II assessments. Prior to the Closing and for a period of one (1)
month following the Closing, if Purchaser notifies Seller that it believes
that one or more Patents may have been a Transferred Patent based on the
application of the criteria on Annex 3.10(a), but was not included in the
list of Transferred Patents (unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Parties
prior to the date hereof), Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to
review the application of such criteria with respect to such Patent and such
Patent shall be deemed to be included in the list of Transferred Patents for
all purposes of this Agreement if such criteria so requires.

(b) Each of the Parties will hold, and will cause its Representatives and
affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.4, in confidence to the extent required
by and in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
Section 5.3, except to the extent set forth herein and therein.

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall establish a
transition and integration planning team (the " _Integration Committee_ "),

Purchaser, (ii) one or two other senior executives of Purchaser designated by
the Chief Executive Officer of Purchaser, (iii) the Chief Executive Officer
and/or Chief Financial Officer of Seller and (iv) one or two other senior
executives of Seller designated by the Chief Executive Officer of Seller. The
chair of the Integration Committee will be the Chief Executive Officer of
Purchaser or such other Person as designated by the Chief Executive Officer of
Purchaser. Subject to applicable Law, the Integration Committee shall, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, discuss and plan for
transition and integration concerning the combination of the operations of the
Business, the Purchased Assets and Purchasers businesses after the Closing
(including with respect to Information Technology transition and migration)
and shall meet from time to time, as reasonably requested by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Purchaser. Subject to applicable Law, Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to take all actions as
may be necessary or advisable to carry out the integration plan as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Parties acknowledge that in no event shall the
implementation of the integration plan (or the readiness in respect thereof)
affect the timing of, or be a condition to, the Closing (other than the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(b)).

(d) For a period of up to five (5) years following the Closing (or seven (7)
years following the Closing in the case of clause (iii) below or twelve (12)
months following the Closing in the case of clause (v) below), Purchaser shall
afford Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, consistent with applicable Law, to the
properties, Business Books and Records and employees of Purchaser (which
employees must be designated in advance by Purchaser) and its Subsidiaries,
in each case to the extent related to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities as Seller may reasonably need and solely for the purpose of (i)
complying with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on
Seller and its Subsidiaries (including under applicable securities Laws) by
any Governmental Entity, (ii) use in preparation for or during any judicial,
regulatory, administrative, investigative or other Proceeding, or in order to
satisfy bona fide Tax, audit, accounting, regulatory, litigation or other
similar requirements or to discharge Retained Liabilities (in each case other
than with respect to any Proceeding or potential Proceeding in which Purchaser
and Seller, or their respective Subsidiaries, are or reasonably could be
adversarial parties to each other), (iii) filing of any Tax Return,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax
audit or other Proceeding in respect of Taxes, (iv) complying with its
obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or (v) any
other reasonable business purpose requiring access to any such employees and
Business Books and Records in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions and the transition of the Business and the Retained Business
resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be
required by this Section 5.4(d) to provide Seller or its Representatives

 



-70- 

    

 with access to or to disclose information (i) that is prohibited from being
disclosed pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access
or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of
such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate
applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of
which would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent
that does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege). Each Party will cooperate to minimize to
the extent reasonably practicable any unnecessary disruption to the
businesses of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that may result from the requests
for access, data and information hereunder. Any access to any properties or
facilities of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to
Purchasers reasonable security measures. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for
its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in performing its obligations
under this Section 5.4(d).

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide Purchaser, as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof (and in any case at least forty-five (45) days prior
to the Asset Selection Cut-Off Time) a listing and a description of any
assets, rights or services (other than _de minimis_ assets or services) that
are primarily related to or primarily used or held for use in the Business.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to
prepare their respective information technology systems for and assist with
the transition of information related to the Business to Purchasers
information technology systems so that such information may be reasonably
usable under Purchasers information technology systems following the
Closing, taking into account the Transaction Documents and all of the assets
and services to be provided, acquired, leased or licensed under the
Transaction Documents; _provided_  that the transition of such information to
Purchasers information technology systems is not a condition to the Closing
and if such transition has not occurred as of the Closing, the Parties shall
continue to cooperate in good faith to complete the transition of such
information as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing.

(g) For a period of up to five (5) years following the Closing (or seven (7)
years following the Closing in the case of clause (iii) below and twelve (12)

afford Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, consistent with applicable Law, to the
properties, books and records and employees of Seller (which employees must be
designated in advance by Seller) and its Subsidiaries, in each case to the
extent related to the Excluded Assets and the Retained Liabilities as
Purchaser may reasonably need and solely for the purpose of (i) complying with
reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries (including under applicable securities Laws) by any
Governmental Entity, (ii) use in preparation for or during any judicial,
regulatory, administrative, investigative or other Proceeding (other than
any Proceeding in which Purchaser and Seller, or their respective
Subsidiaries, are adversarial parties to each other), or in order to satisfy

parties), (iii) filing of any Tax Return, determining a liability for Taxes or
a right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax audit or other Proceeding in respect

agreement with a third party ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in
violation of such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would
violate applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of
which would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent
that does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege). Each Party will cooperate to minimize to the extent
reasonably practicable any unnecessary disruption to the businesses of

5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Employee and Benefit Plan Liabilities._ To the extent any Benefit Plans
or any Liabilities for the period prior to the Closing Date under any Benefit
Plans transfer to Purchaser or its affiliates under applicable Law (including
the Transfer Regulations), Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable
affiliate to, transfer any funds or assets (using a commercially
reasonable valuation thereof, but in no event greater than the value of such
Liabilities that transfer) to Purchaser or its affiliate to cover (i) any
compensation and Benefit Plan Liabilities that arose prior to the Closing and
that transferred to Purchaser or one of its affiliates pursuant to applicable
Law (including without limitation the Transfer Regulations) and (ii) any
Liabilities relating to current or former employees of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than Transferred Business Employees that transfer to
Purchaser or one of its affiliates pursuant to applicable Law (including
without limitation the Transfer Regulations); _provided_ that any Liabilities
arising after the Closing as a result of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or the
applicable PEO providing credit for service pursuant to Section 5.6(j) shall
not be treated as a Liability for purposes of this Section 5.6(a) (it being
understood that any accrued benefits ( _e.g.,_ benefits under a termination
indemnity or gratuity plan) that were accrued under Benefit Plans as of the
Closing that transfer to Purchaser or its affiliates under applicable Law as
of the Closing shall be treated as a Liability for purposes of this Section
5.6(a)). From and after the Closing, the Transferred Business Employees shall
cease to be active participants in the Benefit Plans.

 

(b) _Communications to Business Employees and Business Service Providers_.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Purchaser
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith regarding any written or oral
communications by Purchaser or Seller to any Business Employees or Business
Service Providers (other than offer letters contemplated by Section
5.6(f)), whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of
employment or otherwise relating to the Transactions. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the offers of employment contemplated
by Section 5.6(f) are made, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a schedule of
the Offer Employees indicating the date on which each offer was made and a
summary of the following terms set forth in each offer: (i) base salary or
wage rate, (ii) total annual compensation opportunity (identifying the base
salary or wage rate, target annual bonus opportunity and annual equity
compensation opportunity measured based on the grant date value of such award,
and with the grant date value determined by Purchaser on a basis consistent
with how Purchaser determines grant date value for equity awards granted to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser), (iii) work location, (iv)
severance benefits and (v) any references in such offer to the Offer
Employees participation in Purchasers employee benefits plans (in the case
of each of clauses (i) through (iv), with sufficient detail to permit Seller
to reasonably determine whether such offers were Compliant Offers). Purchaser
shall notify Seller regarding acceptances and rejections of such offers of
employment as soon as reasonably practicable.

(c)  _Service Provider List_. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, on a periodic basis as
reasonably requested by Purchaser, an updated Service Provider List including
the information described in Section 3.7(j) (including the information that
will be included in the updated Service Provider List to be provided as soon
as practicable following the date hereof), with the final Service Provider
List being delivered to Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing, in each case reflecting any resignations from employment and
employees who are hired or terminated or transferred into the Business solely
to the extent permitted by Section 5.2(b)(iii).

 



-73- 

    

(d) _Offer Employees_. Pursuant to Section 5.6(e) and Section
5.6(f), Purchaser may continue or accept the employment of or make offers of
employment to (i) each Pre-Selected Employee selected by Purchaser in its sole
discretion and (ii) each other Business Employee (other than a Pre-Selected
Employee) selected by Purchaser in its sole discretion (each individual
described in clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Offer Employee_ "); _provided_ that
the sum of (x) the Pre-Selected Employees and (y) the Offer Employees who are
not Pre-Selected Employees shall be at least the number of Business Employees
set forth on Section 5.6(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Section_
__ _ 5.6(d) Threshold_"). If Purchaser or its applicable affiliate makes a
Compliant Offer to any Business Employee, such Business Employee shall be
counted for purposes of determining whether Purchaser satisfies the Section
5.6(d) Threshold, irrespective of whether such individual actually commences
employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates (it being understood that
any Business Employee who receives a Compliant Offer who rejects such offer of
employment, refuses to transfer employment to Purchaser, dies, becomes
disabled, or is terminated by Seller for any reason prior to the Closing,
shall be counted as an Offer Employee for purposes of determining whether
Purchaser satisfies the Section 5.6(d) Threshold. In addition, each Section
5.6(k)(iii) Pre-Selected Employee shall be counted for purposes of
determining whether Purchaser satisfies the Section 5.6(d) Threshold. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its affiliates shall have no obligation to
make an offer of employment to or continue the employment of any Business
Employee other than any Offer Employee, and nothing herein shall be construed
as a representation or guarantee by Seller that any Offer Employee will accept
the offers of employment, or offers to continue or accept employment, with
Purchaser.

(e) _TUD Employees_. With respect to each Business Employee who is employed in
a jurisdiction in which the Transfer Regulations have been implemented (a "
_TUD Employee_ "), unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between Seller
and Purchaser following the date hereof that any TUD Employee should receive
an offer of employment pursuant to Section 5.6(f) or that the employment of
any such TUD Employee shall not automatically transfer to Purchaser or one of
its Subsidiaries by operation of the Transfer Regulations, Seller and
Purchaser accept and agree that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitute a relevant transfer for purposes of the Transfer
Regulations and to apply the Transfer Regulations in all of its provisions,
and accept and agree that the terms and conditions of employment of each such
TUD Employee will transfer to Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries (or the
applicable PEO) effective as of the Closing as if such terms and conditions
were originally made or agreed between Purchaser and the applicable TUD
Employee. Seller shall comply, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply,
with its or their obligations under Transfer Regulations, including to provide
employee Liability information to Purchaser. Purchaser shall comply, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to comply, with its or their obligations under the
Transfer Regulations, including, solely to the extent measures information is
known by Purchaser at the time it is initially requested or becomes known by
Purchaser before the Closing, to provide such measures information to Seller.
Seller shall inform and, to the extent necessary, consult with any appropriate
representatives of the TUD Employees (and/or the TUD Employees directly) to
the extent required by the Transfer Regulations or other applicable Law, and
Purchaser shall cooperate in such information and consultation to the extent
required by the Transfer Regulations and other applicable Law.

 



-74- 

    

(f) _Offers of Employment_. Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its
affiliates (or, in Purchasers discretion, a temporary agency or manpower
agency retained by Purchaser or one of its affiliates to provide services to
the Business (any such temporary agency or manpower agency so chosen by
Purchaser, the applicable " _PEO_ ")) to, no later than ten (10) business
days prior to the Closing (or such earlier date to the extent required by
applicable Law), make offers of employment to all the Offer Employees (other
than TUD Employees whose employment transfers to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or the applicable PEO pursuant to Section 5.6(e)), in each case,
(i) with terms and conditions regarding compensation and employee benefits
that meet the standards set forth in Section 5.6(i) and (ii) effective
subject to and upon the occurrence of the Closing. Purchasers, or its
affiliates, offer of employment to each Offer Employee shall be subject to
and conditioned upon such Offer Employees satisfaction of Purchasers
ordinary course hiring criteria imposed on similarly situated employees of
Purchaser, including background checks.

 

(g) _Cooperation in Transfer of Employment._ Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to encourage each Offer Employee to
accept Purchasers or its affiliates or the applicable PEOs Compliant
Offer; _provided_ that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to pay
any additional compensation to such Offer Employees. Except as required
by (i) applicable Law, (ii) any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement,
(iii) Section 5.6(k)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter or any applicable
Benefit Plan set forth thereon or (iv) any individual severance contract
or arrangement with such Offer Employee in accordance with its terms as of
the date hereof, Seller will not pay any severance or similar benefits to any
Offer Employee who, after receiving a Compliant Offer, rejects Purchasers
offer of employment or refuses to transfer employment to Purchaser.

(h) _Transferred Business Employees_. Each Offer Employee whose employment
transfers to Purchaser or any of its affiliates or the applicable PEO
pursuant to Section 5.6(e), each other Offer Employee who accepts Purchasers
or its affiliates or the applicable PEOs offer of employment pursuant
to Section 5.6(f) and each Offer Employee who accepts an offer of employment
from Purchaser or its affiliate or the applicable PEO in accordance with
Section 5.6(n), shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred
Business Employee_."

(i) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. Effective as of the Closing and for
a period of twelve (12) months thereafter (the " _Benefit Continuation
Period_ "), Purchaser shall provide (including in the case of any Transferred
Business Employee whose employment transfers to or who accepts an offer of
employment from the applicable PEO), or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary
to provide, to each Transferred Business Employee, (i) a base salary or wage
rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate as in effect
for such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
total annual compensation (taking into account base salary or wage rate,
target annual bonus opportunity and annual equity compensation opportunity
(with the annual equity compensation opportunity measured based on the grant
date value of such awards, with the grant date value determined by Purchaser
on a basis consistent with how Purchaser determines grant date value for
equity awards granted to similarly situated employees of Purchaser) that is no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than as in effect for such Transferred
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) employee benefits
(excluding severance, base salary, wage rate, target bonus opportunity and
equity compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than as in
effect for similarly situated employees of

 Purchaser, (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits as set forth on Section 5.6(i) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and (v) a work location that is within fifty (50) miles of such
Transferred Business Employees work location immediately prior to the
Closing. With respect to each Offer Employee, an offer of employment or offer
to continue employment by or on behalf of Purchaser with all of the foregoing
terms set forth in this Section (i), which, with respect to Offer Employees
who receive offers of employment pursuant to Section 5.6(f) (i.e., other than
TUD Employees whose employment transfers to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or the applicable PEO pursuant to Section 5.6(e)), is made on a
timely basis pursuant to 5.6(f), is referred to herein as a " _Compliant
Offer_ ".

 

(j) _Service Crediting_. For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and its affiliates or the applicable
PEO providing benefits to any Transferred Business Employees after the Closing
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Business Employee shall, subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with
his or her years of service with Seller and its controlled affiliates and
their respective predecessors before the Closing (including, for avoidance
of doubt, any service credit provided by Seller or its controlled affiliates
to such Transferred Business Employee in connection with acquisitions
occurring prior to the Closing); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Transferred Business Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage
under such New Plan is of the same type as the Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Business Employee participated immediately before the Closing
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to
any Transferred Business Employee, Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Transferred Business Employee and his or her covered
dependents and (B) Purchaser and its applicable Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Transferred Business Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

responsible for any severance benefits payable under applicable Law,
Collective Bargaining Agreement or under Sellers severance policies set forth

who does not transfer employment to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or the
applicable PEO for any reason.

(ii) Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any severance benefits payable
by Purchaser and its affiliates under applicable Law, Collective Bargaining

Employee) who transfers employment to Purchaser or one of its affiliates or
the applicable PEO by operation of any Transfer Regulations or other
applicable Laws and whose employment is terminated by Purchaser or its
affiliate within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (it being
understood that, if applicable Law or any Benefit Plan or contract with the
employee requires notice, such Business Employees employment shall be deemed
terminated within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date if such
individual receives notice of termination within ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date and terminates employment on the earliest possible date
permitted by such notice requirement).

 

(iii) Purchaser will reimburse Seller for any severance benefits payable by
Seller and its affiliates under applicable Law or under Sellers severance
policies set forth on Section 5.6(k)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
arising from (x) Purchasers or its affiliates failure to make an offer of
employment to, or accept or continue the employment of, any Pre-Selected
Employee (whether or not such Pre-Selected Employee is an Offer Employee, and
including as a result of a Pre-Selected Employee who accepts Purchasers
offer of employment but who fails to satisfy Purchasers ordinary course
hiring criteria), (y) from Purchasers failure to make an offer of employment
to any Pre-Selected Employee (whether or not such Pre-Selected Employee is an
Offer Employee) that complies with Section 5.6(f) (each of the Pre-Selected
Employees covered by clause (x) or clause (y), a " _Section_ __ _ 5.6(k)(iii)
Pre-Selected Employee_") or (z) Purchasers election to cause the applicable
PEO to make an offer of employment to any Offer Employee as contemplated by
Section 5.6(f), if as a result thereof any Pre-Selected Employee who but-for
such election would have transferred employment to Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries pursuant Section 5.6(e) does not transfer employment to Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or the applicable PEO; _provided_ that,
with respect to each of clauses (x), (y) and (z), Seller or its affiliate must
terminate the employment of such individual within ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date to be eligible for reimbursement (it being understood that a
termination of employment shall be deemed to have occurred within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date (A) if applicable Law or any Benefit Plan or
contract with the employee requires notice, and such Pre-Selected Employee
receives notice of termination within ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date and terminates employment on the earliest possible date permitted by such
notice requirement and (B) if such Pre-Selected Employee is retained by
Seller and its affiliates to provide services to Purchaser under the
Transition Services Agreement and is terminated within ninety (90) days

similar payments under applicable Law or any applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement upon the termination of his or her employment with Seller
(irrespective of his or her continued employment with Purchaser or one of its
affiliates or the applicable PEO), Purchaser and Seller shall, and Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable PEO to,

Letter).

(l) _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Solely to the extent
required by applicable Law, Seller shall pay each Transferred Business
Employee all accrued but unused vacation, sick leave, personal time and paid
time-off for periods prior to the Closing Date as soon as administratively
practicable following the Closing Date or as otherwise required by applicable
Law. To the extent that applicable Law does not require Seller to pay any
accrued but unused vacation, sick leave and personal time to any
Transferred Business Employee in accordance with this Section 5.6(l),

affiliates with respect to any Liability under COBRA or similar applicable
Laws in the United States arising from the actions (or inactions) of Purchaser

after the Closing Date. Seller shall retain, indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its affiliates for all Liabilities, including with respect to
any "qualifying event" (as defined under COBRA) of any Business Employee
occurring before the Closing Date, and Liabilities under similar applicable
Laws incurred prior to the Closing Date.

(n) _Inactive Employees_. With respect to any Offer Employee (other than a
TUD Employee or a Section 5.6(k)(iii) Pre-Selected Employee described in

term disability benefits as of the Closing Date (each, an " _Inactive
Employee_ "), Purchaser or its applicable affiliate shall make each such
Inactive Employee an offer pursuant to Section 5.6(f), which,
notwithstanding Section 5.6(f), shall be effective upon the date on which
such Inactive Employee is able to return to work; _provided_ that if such
Inactive Employee is not able to return to work prior to the six (6)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser and its affiliates shall have no
obligation to employ such Inactive Employee. For clarity, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and its affiliates
shall not assume any Liabilities with respect to any Inactive Employee until
and unless such Inactive Employee becomes a Transferred Business Employee.

(o) _Defined Contribution Plans_. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser
shall establish eligibility for participation by the Transferred Business
Employees in Purchasers tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans with
a cash or deferred feature (the "Purchaser Defined Contribution Plan") for
the benefit of each Transferred Business Employee who, as of immediately prior
to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Seller Defined Contribution Plans"). As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, the Seller Defined Contribution Plans shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, make distributions available to the applicable Transferred
Business Employees, and the Purchaser Defined Contribution Plan shall accept
any such distribution (including loans) as a rollover contribution if so
directed by such Transferred Business Employees.

(p) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall
cause their affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps, on a timely basis, as
are required under applicable Law or any Collective Bargaining Agreement to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each works council, union,
labor board, employee group, or Governmental Entity where so required under
applicable Law, including the Transfer Regulations. Purchaser shall indemnify
the Seller for any Liabilities incurred by Seller with respect to Purchasers
noncompliance with the foregoing obligations and Seller shall indemnify

respect to Sellers noncompliance with the foregoing obligations, in each
case, except to the extent such noncompliance occurs as a result of applicable
Law.

(q) _Work Permits_. If any Offer Employee requires a work permit or
employment pass or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her
employment with Purchaser or its affiliates, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
such permit, pass or other approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, if an applicable work permit for an Offer Employee is not in place with
Purchaser or its affiliate as of the Closing, such Offer Employee shall be
treated as an Inactive Employee hereunder in accordance with Section 5.6(n).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6(n), with respect to
any Offer Employee whose transfer of employment is delayed pursuant to this
Section 5.6(q), (i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable
work permit, (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, continue
to employ such Offer Employee and make available the services of such Offer
Employee to Purchaser or one of its affiliates until the applicable work
permit is secured and Purchaser employs such Offer Employee, so long as

of such Offer Employees compensation and benefits (including employer-paid
Taxes and social charges) during such interim period, and (iii) Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its affiliate to, employ such Offer Employee as of the
date such Offer Employee is legally permitted to commence employment with
Purchaser or its affiliate, whether or not such date occurs by the six
(6)-month anniversary of the Closing.

(r) _Delayed Transfer Employees_.

 

(i) With respect to any Delayed Transfer Employee and subject to compliance
with applicable Law, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (A) to
make such Delayed Transfer Employee available to Purchaser to provide services
to the Business between the Closing Date and the Delayed Transfer Date and (B)
manage such Delayed Transfer Employee in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, subject to the instructions of the Purchaser
and its affiliates to the extent such instructions relate to the Business or
the Purchased Assets and do not require any action to be taken in violation
of applicable Law. With respect to any Delayed Transfer Employee, if Seller
complies with the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser agrees to
reimburse Seller or its applicable affiliate for the cost of such Delayed
Transfer Employees compensation and benefits (including employer-paid Taxes
and social charges) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the Delayed Transfer Date.

 

(ii) References in this Agreement to the "Closing" or the "Closing Date" as
they relate to such Delayed Transfer Employees (including such references
with respect to the assumption of assets and Liabilities in respect of such
Delayed Transfer Employee in accordance with Section 2.4, Section 2.5, Section
2.6, and Section 2.7) shall be deemed to refer to the Delayed Transfer Date.

 



-79- 

    

(iii) With respect to any Delayed Transfer Employee (A) during the period
beginning at the Closing (determined without regard to the preceding
provisions of this sentence) and ending on the applicable date of the Delayed
Transfer Closing, the restrictions set forth in Sections 5.2(b)(ii) and
5.2(b)(iii) shall continue to apply, (B) the Benefit Continuation Period
shall end on the first anniversary of the Closing Date irrespective of the
date of the Delayed Transfer Closing, and (C) such employee shall in no event
commence employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates until the date of
the applicable Delayed Transfer Closing.

period prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make Business Service Providers and
Business Employees available to Purchaser and its affiliates for the purpose
of informational interviews as reasonably requested by Purchaser. Solely if
requested by Purchaser, Seller shall provide to Purchaser contact information
for Business Service Providers and reasonably cooperate in identifying
and transferring any Business Service Providers selected by Purchaser in its
discretion to Purchaser or one of its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 5.6(s), neither Seller nor any of its affiliates
shall be required to disclose any such information: (i) if doing so would
violate any written obligation of confidentiality to which it or any of its
affiliates is subject or, upon the advice of counsel, would jeopardize
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws or (ii) if Seller reasonably
determines in good faith that such information is competitively sensitive;
_provided_ that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents or take such other
action to permit such access or disclosure.

(t) _Section 280G_. Seller and Purchaser shall discuss in good faith the
impact of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to the Transactions
and shall discuss with each other in good faith their respective calculations
and positions with respect to the same.

 

(u) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
upon any Transferred Business Employee any right to continue in the employ or
service of Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser,
which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Transferred Business Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided
otherwise in a written agreement between Purchaser or any of its affiliates or
Seller or any of its affiliates and the Transferred Business Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Transferred Business Employee, or any Collective Bargaining Agreement or
similar labor agreement with any labor organization, work council or trade
union covering such Transferred Business Employee. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall
(i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its affiliates,
and (ii) create any third party rights in any Business Employee, Business
Service Provider, current or former employee or other service provider of
Seller or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

_Materials_ ") or shall alter any such Materials so as to remove the Seller
Trademarks (in the case of the Purchaser and its affiliates) or the
Transferred Trademarks (in the case of the Seller and its affiliates), except
to the extent that the use of the Seller Trademarks or Transferred Trademarks
(as applicable) on such Materials does not require a license under applicable
Law.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in the Trademark License Agreement, Seller
hereby grants Purchaser and its Subsidiaries during such one hundred and
eighty (180)-day period after the Closing, a limited, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable right to use the Seller
Trademarks on such Materials in connection with the Business in substantially
the same manner as such Seller Trademarks and Materials were used in
connection with the Business immediately prior to the Closing. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 5.7(e), Purchaser hereby grants Seller and
its Subsidiaries during such one hundred and eighty (180)-day period after the
Closing, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-
sublicensable right to use the Transferred Trademarks on such Materials in
connection with the Retained Business in substantially the same manner as
such Trademarks and Materials were used in connection with the Retained
Business immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to Seller
Trademarks and Transferred Trademarks containing the word SYMANTEC, (i)
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall (A) use reasonable best efforts to
discontinue their use as contemplated by Section 5.7(b) and Section 5.7(c) as
promptly as practicable and in any event within one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the Closing and (B) discontinue their use in no event later than
twelve (12) months after the Closing and (ii) the licenses granted pursuant to
Section 5.7(d) shall continue for the duration set forth therein. In
addition, to the extent any such Seller Trademarks are Registered Intellectual
Property, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, renew any
such registered Trademarks or further prosecute pending applications for
such Trademarks.

 



-81- 

    

(f) Purchaser, for itself and its affiliates, agrees that (except as otherwise
provided in the Trademark License Agreement) (i) use of the Seller Trademarks
during the period authorized by this Section 5.7 shall not be for any
materials or services (including new marketing or advertising materials or
product, training or service literature) produced, created or developed after
the Closing and (ii) the Materials and all services offered in connection
therewith shall be of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality
of materials and services with respect to which the Business used the Seller
Trademarks immediately prior to the Closing. Seller, for itself and its
affiliates, agrees that (i) use of the Transferred Trademarks during the
period authorized by this Section 5.7 shall not be for any materials or
services (including new marketing or advertising materials or product,
training or service literature) produced, created or developed after the
Closing and (ii) the Materials and all services offered in connection
therewith shall be of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality
of materials and services with respect to which the Retained Business used
such Trademarks immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(g) Any goodwill arising from the use of the Seller Trademarks as described in
this Section 5.7 shall inure to the sole benefit of Seller and its
affiliates. Any goodwill arising from the use of the Transferred Trademarks as
described in this Section 5.7 shall inure to the sole benefit of Purchaser and
its affiliates.

 

5.8 _Potential Assumed Liabilities_. If, following the date hereof and
continuing after the Closing, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries becomes aware
of any event that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Proceeding that
was not known as of the date hereof and could reasonably be expected to be or
result in an Assumed Liability (other than any immaterial Liability) (a "
_Potential Assumed Liability_ "), Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, promptly notify Purchaser of the Potential Assumed Liability
prior to taking any action relating thereto, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, prior to (a) taking any remedial or corrective action to resolve the
Potential Assumed Liability, or (b) notifying any Person (including any
Governmental Entity) of the Potential Assumed Liability or its underlying
facts and circumstances (in the case of this clause (b), solely to the extent
permitted by applicable Law). Upon notice of the Potential Assumed Liability,
Seller shall afford Purchaser and its affiliates a reasonable opportunity to
reasonably investigate the Potential Assumed Liability, and shall promptly
provide copies to Purchaser and its affiliates of any relevant documents
relating to the Potential Assumed Liability that are reasonably available to
Seller or is Subsidiaries or material communications with other Persons
(including Governmental Entities) relating to the Potential Assumed Liability.
If and until the Parties mutually agree that the Potential Assumed Liability
is not an Assumed Liability, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives to, except to the extent prohibited by Law, (x) not take
any action in respect of such Liability, including making any communication
with, or reporting the Potential Assumed Liability to, any other Person
(including any Governmental Entity) or discussing, negotiating or entering
into any settlement, compromise or other resolution in respect of such event,
in each case without Purchasers prior written consent (such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (y) follow Purchaser
or its affiliates reasonable instructions with respect to the Potential
Assumed Liability. In the event that Seller, acting reasonably, notifies
Purchaser of a good faith disagreement with Purchasers instructions or any
part thereof, the Parties shall in

 



-82- 

    

 good faith discuss resolving the dispute and if Seller thereafter continues
to disagree in good faith with Purchasers instruction (or any part thereof),
Seller shall not be required to follow such instruction (or part thereof). If
in the opinion of Sellers counsel any Potential Assumed Liability is required
to be reported or otherwise disclosed to a Governmental Entity, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, inform Purchaser of
such requirement and keep Purchaser reasonably informed of, and consult with
Purchaser with respect to, any such communications with a Governmental Entity.

 

5.9 _Insurance_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided under this Section 5.9, from and after the
Closing, (i) the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities shall cease to
be insured by, entitled to any benefits or coverage under or entitled to seek
benefits or coverage from or under any insurance policies of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or by any of their respective self-insurance programs (" _Seller
Policies_ "), (ii) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall retain all rights to
control such insurance policies and self-insurance programs, including the
right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any such Seller Policies, notwithstanding whether any
such Seller Policies apply to any Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities and
(iii) neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall have any access, right,
title or interest to or in any such Seller Policies (including to any claims
or rights to make (or pursue existing) claims or any rights to proceeds).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to (A) events relating to the
Assumed Liabilities or (B) losses or damages related to the Purchased Assets,
each of which occurred or existed prior to the Closing and which, in each
case, are covered by Sellers or its Subsidiaries occurrence-based third-
party liability insurance policies (" _Available Insurance Policies_ ")
subject in all cases to the terms and limitations of such policies (" _Valid
Pre-Closing Claims_"), (x) Purchaser may promptly notify Seller of any matter
that is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim under any such policy (
_provided_ that the failure to promptly notify Seller shall not relieve
Seller from its obligations under clause (y)), and (y) Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) make Valid Pre-Closing Claims and use
reasonable best efforts to pursue and seek to recover on such claims, and (B)
promptly deliver to Purchaser any insurance proceeds received with respect
thereto (calculated net of reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery and any increase in premiums or retroactive premium adjustments or
chargebacks paid by or on behalf of Seller or its Subsidiaries to the extent
as a result of such claims, and taking into account the available coverage
under each relevant insurance policy, it being understood that such coverage
shall first be available to satisfy other claims of Seller or its Subsidiaries
that are pending under such policy at the time the claim for the benefit of
Purchaser is made); _provided_ that, unless otherwise deducted from the
proceeds received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay (or reimburse Seller for),
without duplication, any deductibles or retention amounts or other costs in
each case to the extent resulting from any claim made by Seller or its
Subsidiaries on behalf of any of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries under such
policies for Valid Pre-Closing Claims. Following the Closing, if permitted,
Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to notify, make and
pursue applicable claims as contemplated by this Section 5.9(a) under the
Available Insurance Policies, subject to the payment and reimbursement
provisions set forth in the prior sentence. It is understood and agreed that
claims for benefits or coverage under Seller Policies for Retained Liabilities
or to the extent relating to the Excluded Assets shall not constitute Valid
Pre-Closing Claims. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in connection with
making any Valid Pre-Closing Claims and each Party shall provide the other
with all reasonably requested information necessary to make such 

 



-83- 

    

 claim. Seller shall promptly forward to Purchaser any communication from an
insurer in respect of such claims and, to the extent applicable, reasonably
assist Purchasers or its applicable Subsidiarys communications with an
insurer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to bring any Proceedings to
obtain any insurance coverage for any Valid Pre-Closing Claim.

(b) No member of the Seller Group shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any
rights under any Available Insurance Policies in a manner that would reduce
in any material respect the insurance coverage for Covered Losses as to which
the Business has made, or could in the future make, a claim for coverage
pursuant to Section 5.9(a) for Valid Pre-Closing Claims. If Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries receives insurance proceeds in connection with any Available
Insurance Policies to the extent relating to the Business or any Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability, Seller shall cause such proceeds to be promptly
delivered to the Person designated by Purchaser.

 

5.10 _Further Assurances; Misallocated Assets; Misdirected Payments_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, each of the Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge and
deliver any additional documents, instruments or conveyances reasonably
requested by a Party at no cost to further perfect or evidence the
consummation of, or otherwise implement, the Transactions or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to aid in the preparation of
any regulatory filings or financial statements.

(b) Subject to Section 2.10, if, following the Closing, any right, property
or asset that would constitute an Excluded Asset is found to have been
transferred to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in error, either directly or
indirectly, Purchaser shall transfer, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
transfer, at no cost, such right, property or asset (and any related
Liabilities) as soon as practicable to Seller or its designated Subsidiary
indicated by Seller in writing. If, following the Closing, any right, property
or asset that would constitute a Purchased Asset is found to have been
retained by any member of the Seller Group in error, either directly or
indirectly, Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the other members of the
Seller Group to transfer, at no cost, such right, property or asset (and any
related Liabilities) as soon as practicable to Purchaser or its designated
Subsidiary, indicated by Purchaser in writing.

 

(c) After the Closing, if any payments due with respect to the Business or
Purchased Assets are paid to any member of the Seller Group (including any
payments from any customer under any Business Contracts), Seller shall remit,
or shall cause another member of the Seller Group to remit, by wire transfer,
such payment to an account indicated by Purchaser in writing promptly
after receipt thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, any and all accounts
receivable or other Excluded Asset of Seller or its Subsidiaries existing as
of the Closing shall not be subject to this Section 5.10(c)). After the
Closing, if any payments due with respect to the Retained Business or with
respect to an Excluded Asset are paid to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
Purchaser shall remit, or shall cause such Subsidiary to remit, by wire
transfer, such payment to an account indicated by Seller in writing promptly
after receipt thereof.

(d) If Purchaser discovers an error in the list of Transferred Patents such
that a Patent or Patent application that was previously identified by the
Parties as being a Transferred Patent is not included in the list of
Transferred Patents, Seller shall promptly cause such Patent or Patent
application to be included as a Transferred Patent hereunder.

 



-84- 

    

5.11 _Litigation and Investigation Support_.

 

(a) For up to five (5) years following the Closing (but with respect to the
matters listed in Section 2.7(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, until the
final resolution thereof), Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Seller and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, shall reasonably cooperate
with each other (and at the requesting Partys cost and expense with respect
to reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the other Party and its
Subsidiaries) in the defense or settlement of any Liabilities or Proceedings
(or any internal corporate investigations or audits) (other than any
Proceeding in which Purchaser and Seller, or their respective Subsidiaries,
are adversarial parties) involving the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities,
Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities, including by providing the other
Party and such other Partys legal counsel reasonable access to employees (as
designated by the Party providing such access), records and documents as such
other Party may reasonably request, to the extent maintained or under the
possession or control of such Party and its affiliates; _provided_ that either
Party may restrict the foregoing access or the provision of such information
to the extent that (i) applicable Law requires such Party or any of its
affiliates, as applicable, to restrict or prohibit such access or the
provision of such information ( _provided_ that such Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit disclosure not in violation of such Law); and (ii) providing such
access or disclosure of any such information would reasonably be expected to
result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other applicable
privilege or protection ( _provided_ that such Party and its affiliates shall
enter into such customary joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of such privilege or protection). The requesting Party
shall reimburse the other Party for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in performing its obligations under this Section 5.11(a). In
connection with the foregoing cooperation, the Designated Attorneys shall
discuss in good faith ways to allow the Parties to comply with this Section
5.11 in a cost-effective manner. The Parties agree that, with respect to any
matters that are the subject of this Section 5.11(a) and Section 6.2, the
provisions of Section 6.2 (and not this Section 5.11(a)) shall control.

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, for up to five (5) years following the
Closing (but with respect to the matters listed in Section 2.7(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, until the final resolution thereof), Seller and
Purchaser shall and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon written
reasonable request, their employees (in each case, as the Parties shall
reasonably agree), to the extent reasonably necessary for fact finding,
consultation and interviews and as witnesses in connection with any Proceeding
or investigation in which the requesting Party may from time to time be
involved arising from, or relating to, the conduct of the Business or with
respect to any Purchased Asset, Excluded Asset, Assumed Liability or Retained
Liability, in each case subject to Section 5.11(a). Seller and Purchaser
agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the other or their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
providing individuals and witnesses in connection with the foregoing. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party shall appoint one or more in-house
attorney to act as the main point or points of contact with responsibility
for obtaining and providing requested records and witnesses in connection with
the foregoing (such attorneys, the " _Designated Attorneys_ "). Each Party, 

 



-85- 

    

 through its Designated Attorneys, will work in good faith in any particular
legal matter, including by making all reasonable efforts to expedite any
matter for which the status of the legal action so requires. Where
substantial document collections are required, Seller and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate together to jointly instruct an electronic discovery
provider (who shall be paid solely by the Party requesting such
document collection hereunder) to facilitate the collection information under
this Section 5.11(b), subject to appropriate confidentiality, procedural and
security agreements. Either Party may advise the other of the need to preserve
Business Books and Records in connection with a claim, litigation or
investigation and the reasons for preservation, and the other Party shall in
good faith consider implementing a legal hold to preserve such records to the
extent reasonably requested within the scope mutually agreed; _provided_ that
the Party requesting the legal hold shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other Party and its Subsidiaries and Representatives for all costs, expenses
and other Liabilities to the extent arising from or related to such legal
hold or preservation.

(c) From the date hereof and continuing following the Closing, with respect to
any matters listed in Part A of Section 2.7(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and any other litigation or investigation matters to the extent
presenting a reasonable likelihood of materially affecting the conduct of the
Business or materially impacting any Business Product or otherwise adversely
and materially impacting the Business (or Purchaser or its Subsidiaries) or
resulting in a Patent Grant that would have covered any Intellectual Property
Rights embedded in any Business Product had such Patent Grant occurred prior
to the Closing (the " _Specified Retained Litigation Matters_ "), and subject
to the execution of a customary joint defense agreement to the extent
necessary to preserve the attorney-client privilege, Seller shall (i) provide
Purchaser with reasonably prompt updates regarding material changes to the
status of, or any material developments relating to, such matters, (ii)
promptly provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser draft versions of any
proposed agreements relating to a compromise or settlement of the Specified
Retained Litigation Matters (other than an agreement to pay money damages to
settle that does not (A) involve any admission of wrongdoing in any way
relating to the Business, (B) contain any affirmative or negative covenants
by or affecting the operations of any part of the Business or of Purchaser or
any of its affiliates and (C) result in any Patent Grant) and subsequent
drafts thereof that are shared with the counsel to the opposing parties in
the Specified Retained Litigation Matters and give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Purchaser or
its counsel to the extent relating to the Business; _provided_ that, after
giving such due consideration, Seller shall retain sole discretion as to the
final content thereof, and (iii) promptly provide, or cause to be provided, to
Purchaser any other information and/or documentation related to the Specified
Retained Litigation Matters reasonably requested by Purchaser.

(d) From the date hereof and continuing following the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and giving due consideration to the relative benefits
of such proposed settlement to each of Purchaser and Seller, Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, compromise or settle any claim,
litigation, investigation or other Proceeding relating to the Specified
Retained Litigation Matters in any manner: (i) that would materially affect
the conduct of the Business or materially impact any Business Product
(including any Intellectual Property Rights relating to any Business Product)
or otherwise adversely and materially impact the Business (or Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries) following the Closing or (ii) that results in Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries receiving a prospective license, release, covenant not to
sue, standstill or any other prospective

 



-86- 

    

 rights or immunities under or with respect to any third party Patent(s) (a "
_Patent Grant_ "), whereby Purchaser does not also receive a Patent Grant
under or with respect to the same third party Patent(s) covering or applying
to the Business and the Business Products in the same manner and to the same
degree that the Sellers Patent Grant covers and applies to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries and their products.

 

5.12 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Parties hereby waive compliance with any
applicable so-called "bulk sale" or "bulk transfer" Laws or similar Laws.

5.13 _Sublicense of Third Party Patent Licenses_. If (x) Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to a Contract (other than a Business Contract)
pursuant to which it has received a license to, or other immunity under, the
Patents of a third party that are related to the Business (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Contracts that are otherwise Excluded Assets to the
extent such Contracts relate to the Business), and (y) Purchaser in its sole
discretion requests in writing prior to the Asset Selection Cut-Off Time that
any such licenses or immunities be sublicensed to Purchaser, Seller shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, grant a sublicense to, or
otherwise extend the benefit of such license or immunity to, Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, to the extent that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are
permitted under the applicable Contract to sublicense or otherwise extend the
benefit of such license or immunity without obtaining a consent from any
third party. To the extent that a consent from a third party is required,
Seller will, or will cause its applicable Subsidiary to, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consent required from the third party to grant such a
sublicense or to otherwise extend the benefit of such license or immunity
(and Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller and its
applicable Subsidiaries in connection therewith); _provided_ that neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall have any obligation under this Section 5.13 to pay
any consent, approval or waiver fee, discount, rebate or any money or other
consideration beyond administrative costs or __ immaterial review charges, or
provide any additional security (including any guaranty) to any Person in
order to grant or receive, as applicable, a sublicense to such license or
immunity, unless Purchaser requests and reimburses or indemnifies Seller for
such payment or security. If any consent by a third party is required for
Seller to sublicense such license or immunity and such consent is not obtained
prior to Closing, then Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
such consent until the earliest of (x) such time as such consent is obtained,
(y) nine (9) months following the Closing Date and (z) the expiration of the
term of the applicable license in accordance with its current term.

 

5.14 _Lien Releases_. At or in connection with the Closing, Seller shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, take all actions required to
cause the release of any Liens, if any, on any Purchased Asset securing any
secured Indebtedness of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

5.15 _Exclusivity_.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, affiliates and
Representatives not to, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by furnishing non-public information concerning the Business or
the Purchased Assets) any inquiry, proposal or offer (a " _Competing Proposal_
") with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Transaction, or enter into discussions or negotiate with any Person
in furtherance of such an inquiry, proposal or offer or to obtain a Competing
Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction.

 



-87- 

    

(b) If Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives,
receives a Competing Proposal, Seller shall, promptly (and in any event
within one (1) business day) notify Purchaser of any receipt by any director
or officer of Seller or by any of Sellers other affiliates, or its or their
respective Representatives, of any Competing Proposal or any proposals or
inquiries that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Business
by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make any
Competing Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person
making the Competing Proposal, inquiry or request, and the material terms and
conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information
requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including unredacted copies of
all written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements
received by Seller or, if such Competing Proposal is not in writing,
a reasonably detailed written description of the material terms and
conditions thereof. Without limiting Sellers other obligations under this
Section 5.15, Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed on a prompt and
timely basis of any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms
of any such Competing Proposal or potential Competing Proposal and shall
promptly provide Purchaser with such information as Purchaser may reasonably
request regarding the status and material terms of any such Competing
Proposal or potential Competing Proposal (including as to the nature of any
information requested of Seller with respect thereto).

 

(c) Sellers shall not amend, terminate, waive or fail to enforce any
provisions of any confidentiality agreement with respect to any
potential Competing Transaction, and promptly request, in accordance with the
terms of any such confidentiality agreement, the return or destruction of any
confidential information previously furnished pursuant thereto.

 

(d) Any breach of any of the covenants in this Section 5.15 by any affiliates
or Representatives of Seller shall be deemed a breach by Seller.

5.16 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_. 

(a) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, with respect to each Offer Employee who is
employed by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the
Closing (for the purposes of this Section 5.16(a), each a " _Business Covered
Person_ "), Seller agrees that none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries will
solicit for employment any Business Covered Person; _provided_ that Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall not be restricted from (i) soliciting for employment
any Business Covered Person who has ceased to be employed or engaged by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries for a period of at least six (6) months without
any prior solicitation prohibited hereunder or (ii) making general
solicitations for employment not specifically directed at Business Covered
Persons. 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Seller, with respect to each employee of Seller or its
Subsidiaries who is not an Offer Employee as of the Closing (for the purposes
of this Section 5.16(b), each a " _Seller Covered Person_ "), Purchaser agrees
that none of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries will solicit for employment
any Seller Covered Person; _provided_ that Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
shall not be restricted from (i) soliciting for employment any Seller Covered
Person who has ceased to be employed or engaged by Seller or its Subsidiaries
for a period of at least six (6) months without any prior solicitation
prohibited hereunder or (ii) making general solicitations for employment not
specifically directed at Seller Covered Persons.

 



-88- 

    

(c) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, except as permitted
by Section 5.16(d), neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries or other
controlled affiliates shall (and Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries and other
controlled affiliates not to), directly or indirectly (including through any
licenses, reorganizations, sales, transfers or grants of assets or rights or
other transactions), operate, engage or participate in, carry on in any
manner, or have an ownership interest in any Person engaged in, any business
activities that are included within the definition of the Business, or that
otherwise compete in enterprise markets with the Business, in each case in the
jurisdictions in which any of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries conducted any
part of the Business prior to the Closing (the " _Covered Business_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller and its Subsidiaries and other controlled
affiliates may: (i) engage in or operate the LifeLock ID Analytics Business
and (ii) sell products and services of the Retained Business directly or
indirectly (x) to a SMB Entity and (y) to or through a Person (regardless of
size and including any Governmental Entity) (or successive such Persons, in
the case of a multi-tier distribution model) solely for personal use by such
Persons employees or for resale or provision by such Persons to individuals
or SMB Entities who are customers of such Persons solely for personal use by
such individuals or SMB Entities. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in
the event that a Person other than an individual consumer or SMB Entity
purchases a product or service of the Retained Business and Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or controlled affiliates did not engage in any direct or
indirect solicitation or other encouragement of, or any sales or marketing or
other similar efforts targeted at, such Person (or category of similar
Persons) in connection with or relating to such sale (such Person, an "
_Unsolicited Purchaser_ "), such transaction shall not, in and of itself,
constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c)_; _provided_ that to the
extent Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates
becomes aware that such transaction has occurred or is reasonably likely to
occur, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such transaction or
contemplated transaction (including, if not prohibited by applicable Law, the
identity and contact information of such purchaser known to Seller) and
Seller shall also notify such Unsolicited Purchaser (in form and content
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) that Seller is no longer engaged in the
business of selling products or services to enterprise customers (other than
SMB Entities) and that such Unsolicited Purchaser should contact Purchaser for
its enterprise needs.

(d) Section 5.16(c) shall not preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates from (i) owning five percent
(5%) or less of the outstanding securities and voting power of any Person
engaged in the Covered Business, so long as neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates or its or their respective
directors, officers or employees exercise management or control functions with
respect to such Person, (ii) exercising its rights or performing or complying
with its obligations under or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or
any of the Transaction Documents, or (iii) engaging in any business activity
that would otherwise violate Section 5.16(c) that is acquired from any Person
(an " _Acquired Business_ ") or is carried on by any Person that is acquired
by or combined with Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller, in each case, after the
Closing Date (an " _Acquired Company_ "); _provided_ that the business
activity that would otherwise violate Section 5.16(c) did not account for more
than one-third of the average gross revenues of the Acquired Business or
Acquired Company, as applicable, over the three (3) most recently completed
fiscal years of such Acquired Business or Acquired Company prior to the
acquisition, and within six (6) months after the consummation of Sellers
purchase or other acquisition of the Acquired Business or the Acquired
Company, Seller or such Subsidiary or controlled affiliate of Seller disposes
of the Acquired Business or the relevant portion of the Acquired Companys
business or securities or at the expiration of the six (6)-month period, the
business of the Acquired Business or the Acquired Company complies with
Section 5.16(c).

 



-89- 

    

5.17 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation and information, in
each case that is reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the
Financing, including:

 

(i) furnishing to Purchaser such information regarding the Business as is
reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser (A) in connection with the
arrangement or consummation of the Financing, (B) reasonably necessary to
permit Purchaser to prepare pro forma financial statements customarily
included in marketing and offering documents for an offering of securities of
Purchaser on a registration statement filed with the SEC, or (C) necessary to

any actions that would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be breached by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or that would cause any
condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ to fail to be satisfied (in each
case unless Purchaser irrevocably waives such breach or failure prior to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries taking such action);

the Financing pursuant to this Agreement, the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith (other than written information provided by
or on behalf of Seller) and the cooperation contemplated by Section 5.17,

expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties are the result of (i) the
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of Seller or any Subsidiary
of Seller or their respective Representatives, (ii) any such Persons material

in this Agreement to the "Financing" (other than in Section 4.5) shall

thereof (which may, in the case of fee letters, be redacted to remove fees,
the rates and amounts in the "market flex", if any, and other terms that would
not adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination
of the Financing contemplated thereby). Purchaser shall give Seller prompt
(and in any event within five (5) business days) written notice of any
circumstance of which Purchaser becomes aware that could reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the timely availability of, or the
amount of, the Financing. Purchaser shall keep Seller informed, at Sellers
reasonable request from time to time, of the status of its efforts to arrange
and consummate the Financing.

of this Agreement, the Parties shall negotiate, acting reasonably and in good
faith, to agree on the Services to be provided by Seller to Purchaser
following the Closing pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, and the
Services to be provided by Purchaser to Seller following the Closing pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement, including in each case the Charges (as
defined in the Transition Services Agreement) for such Services to the extent
applicable. To the extent that, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, the
Parties are unable to agree upon all of the Services (including the applicable
Charges) to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement within sixty
(60) days after the date of this Agreement, such unresolved matters shall be
referred for resolution to the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, on the one
hand, and Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser, on the other hand, who shall
work together in good faith to reach final resolution as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Parties agree to the matters set forth in Annex
5.19.

ARTICLE VI

 

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

6.1  _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any applicable analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law),
the Parties agree (and agree to cause their respective affiliates) to treat
any and all payments under Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes.

 

6.2 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Each Party shall, and shall
cause its affiliates to, cooperate and (at the expense of the requesting
Party to the extent that any out-of-pocket expenses or costs are incurred)
provide to the other Party and its affiliates such documentation, information
and assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection with (i) the
preparation of any Tax Return relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities (including, for the avoidance of doubt and to the
extent relevant, information and assistance relating to the documentation
requirements under Section 250 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder) or (ii) the conduct of any Tax Proceeding relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

6.3 _Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay fifty
percent (50%) of any sales, use, transfer (including real estate transfer),
documentary, stamp, or similar Taxes and fees (other than VAT) imposed on or
payable in connection with the transfer of the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), in
each case regardless of the Person liable for such Taxes under applicable Law.
The Parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary to reduce or eliminate
any potential Transfer Taxes associated with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including obtaining all available Transfer Tax exemption
certificates from applicable state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions.
The Party that is required to do so under applicable Law shall file any Tax
Return that is required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes and shall
pay any Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return when due, subject to
reimbursement by the other Party within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
written notice of such payment.

 



-94- 

    

(b) The amount of any payment for a supply of goods and services or the value
of any supply made by Seller or any member of the Seller Group pursuant to
this Agreement (or pursuant to any instrument of conveyance intended to effect
the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Agreement) shall be
exclusive of any VAT properly chargeable, and the amount of such VAT shall be
paid by Purchaser in addition to any payment due under this Agreement upon
receipt of a proper VAT invoice. The Parties intend that the Purchased Assets
shall, wherever possible, be sold as a "going concern" for purposes of any
applicable VAT legislation, so that such sale is outside the scope of VAT,
and, in each jurisdiction where the Parties consider this possible, Seller and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the
availability of such treatment. Purchaser shall further use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue the refund, offset, or credit of any VAT imposed
on the transfer of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities to the extent
permitted by applicable Tax law. In the event Purchaser (or a Subsidiary of
Purchaser) has not obtained the benefit of a refund, offset, or credit of the
full amount of VAT paid pursuant to this Agreement within one (1) year of
the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the
amount of any VAT for which no such refund, offset, or credit was obtained. At
least thirty (30) days prior to the end of such one (1) year period, Purchaser
shall notify Seller of any jurisdictions where Purchaser expects to be unable
to obtain a refund, offset or credit of VAT and shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller in any further efforts to obtain such refund, offset or credit
from the relevant jurisdictions; _provided_ that the failure to provide such
notice shall not limit Purchasers rights under this Section 6.3(b) to be
indemnified in respect of such VAT, except to the extent that Seller is
actually prejudiced thereby. In the event that Purchaser (or a Subsidiary of
Purchaser) subsequently receives the benefit of a refund, offset, or credit
relating to such VAT, Purchaser shall pay Seller fifty percent (50%) of any
such refund, offset or credit (to the extent Seller has complied with its
obligations in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to such refund,
offset or credit).

6.4  _Proration of Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, (a) Property Taxes and refunds thereof allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period,
respectively, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period and (b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes)
and refunds thereof for the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such
taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and for
the Post-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable period began on
the day after the Closing Date. The Party that has the primary obligation to
do so under applicable Law shall file any Tax Return that is required to be
filed in respect of Taxes described in this Section 6.4, and such Party shall
pay when due the Taxes shown on such Tax Return. To the extent any such Taxes
paid by Purchaser (or refunds thereof) are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period
or Taxes paid by Seller (or refunds thereof) are allocable to the Post-
Closing Period, as determined pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
6.4, Seller shall pay to Purchaser and Purchaser shall pay to Seller, as
appropriate, such proportionate amount promptly after the payment of such
Taxes (or receipt of such refund).

representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall
have become inaccurate, and in either case of clause (A) or clause (B) where

the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim
or demand and the Covered Losses incurred or suffered as a result thereof and
providing all material documents reflecting or evidencing the basis for such
claim;  _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party suffers actual loss or
prejudice as a result of such failure or delay.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall respond promptly to any claim for
indemnification by the Indemnified Party, and, in the event of any dispute in

(i) The Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified
Party delivered within twenty (20) business days of the receipt of notice of
such Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third-Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party). Notwithstanding
an election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ one separate co-counsel and to
participate in the defense as counsel of record, if applicable, in such
Proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel if (A) there exists a conflict of
interest, as advised by outside counsel for the Indemnified Party, between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense
of the Third-Party Claim, that would make representation by the same counsel
or the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate; (B) such
Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; or (C) such Third-Party Claim is related to or otherwise
arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Proceeding.

circumstances where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the
relevant Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified
Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of any
Third-Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(c), the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to assume and control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may
nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel
and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party Claim, and
shall keep such Persons informed of all developments relating to any such
Third-Party Claims, and provide true, complete and correct copies of all
material and relevant correspondence and documentation (including court
papers) relating thereto; _provided_ that either Party may restrict the
provision of such information to the extent that (A) applicable Law requires
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to restrict or prohibit
the provision of such information ( _provided_ that such Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law); (B) providing such
information would breach any obligation of confidentiality to which a Party or
any of its Subsidiaries may be subject ( _provided_ that such Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party
to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not
in violation of such consent requirement); or (C) providing disclosure of any
such information would reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver
of the attorney-client or other applicable privilege or protection (
_provided_ that such Party and its affiliates shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of such privilege or protection).

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of
a Third-Party Claim, it shall not be authorized to consent to a settlement or
compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (A) the Indemnified
Party, as a condition to settlement, is given a complete and unconditional
release of any and all Liabilities by all relevant parties to such Third-Party
Claim; (B) the damages payable under the settlement are limited only to
monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party; (C) such Third-Party Claim does not involve any non-
monetary relief of any kind (including any injunctive relief) against any
Indemnified Party or finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission
of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party; and (D) the settlement of such
Third-Party Claim would not have a material impact on the Business after the
Closing (in the case of Seller being the Indemnifying Party) or the Retained
Business after the Closing (in the case of Purchaser being the Indemnifying
Party). For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation or right to obtain or agree to any settlement, compromise,
discharge or release with respect to any portion of a Third-Party Claim that
is not fully indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party hereunder. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no
Indemnified Party will admit any Liability, or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise, with respect to a Third-
Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party may have any liability hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if the Indemnified
Party is the only Person with actual or potential liability with respect to
the Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives any rights
it may have to indemnification under this Article IX with respect to
such Third-Party Claim.

9.5 _Calculation of Covered Losses_. Covered Losses shall be calculated net of
any amounts actually recovered under insurance policies and contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions in each case with third parties (in
each case, calculated net of reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery and, with respect to recoveries from insurance, any increase in
premiums or retroactive premium adjustments or chargebacks paid by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party solely as a result of the insurance claim
related to such Covered Loss).

 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that,
except (a) with respect to or in connection with fraud or willful breach by a
Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; (b) as provided in
Section 10.11; (c) as expressly provided in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; and (d) with respect to any failure by any Party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents after the Closing, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3

 



-101- 

    

 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and Purchaser,
respectively, and their respective affiliates, for any Covered Losses that
each Party (or its affiliates) may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been
performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right of rescission it
may otherwise have or to which it may become entitled.

9.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) except with respect to or in connection with
fraud or willful breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party or its
affiliates, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict
Liability) or otherwise, at law or in equity for, and Covered Losses shall not
include, any special or punitive damages, except to the extent awarded
against an Indemnified Party in connection with a third party claim; and (b)
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification hereunder to the
extent that such indemnification would constitute a duplicative payment for
the same Covered Losses.

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1  _Amendment and Modification; Waiver_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by
written agreement of each of the Parties.

(b) At any time and from time to time prior to the Closing, either Seller, on

applicable, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made by the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered

conditions for their respective benefit contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of Purchaser or Seller to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Purchaser

exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder.

except as set forth otherwise in Section 5.11(a), Section 5.11(b), and
Section 6.3, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

expenses.

10.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section,
Exhibit, Annex and Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the
meaning set

 



-103- 

    

 forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word "extent" and the phrase
"to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such word or phrase shall not merely mean
"if." The term "or" is not exclusive. The phrases "the date of this
Agreement," "the date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of similar
import, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble to this
Agreement. The phrase "made available," when used with respect to any
document, agreement or information provided by Seller, shall mean that such
document, agreement or information has been posted to the electronic data room
captioned "Beachball" hosted by Merrill DatasiteOne, at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to the date hereof and is fully available and visible to
Purchaser and its Representatives. The table of contents and headings set
forth in this Agreement or any schedule delivered pursuant to this Agreement
are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or
be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or such schedule or any term or provision hereof or thereof. All
references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include
all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise
indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 

10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile
or by other electronic transmission by the Parties, in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .pdf format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

10.6 _Entire Agreement_ _; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Letter), the other
Transaction Documents, the French Offer Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement (which agreement shall continue in effect in
accordance with its terms) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1, Purchaser shall be permitted to take the actions expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

(b) Except (i) with respect to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the
Seller Indemnified Parties solely with respect to Article IX or (ii) as
provided in Section 10.12, nothing in this Agreement (including the Seller
Disclosure Letter) or in the Confidentiality Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder or thereunder.

 



-104- 

    

10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

10.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims, causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or statute) or other matter that may directly or indirectly result from,
arise out of, be in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the other
agreements delivered in connection herewith, or the execution or performance
of this Agreement or such other agreements or the Transactions (the "
_Relevant Matters_ ") shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other
state. 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Relevant Matter or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in such courts; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents
to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in this Section 10.8(b) in the manner provided for notices
in Section 10.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
RELEVANT MATTERS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.9.

 



-105- 

    

10.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving
any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

10.11 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed or is threatened to not
be performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
It is agreed that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any
other Party, to a decree or order of specific performance specifically
enforcing the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to any further
equitable relief.

(c) The Parties rights in this Section 10.11 are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.11 (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.11, such Party shall not be required
to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

10.12  _Certain Financing Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries hereby: (a) (i) agrees that any Proceedings, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing
Parties, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any of
the agreements (including any applicable commitment letter) entered into in
connection with the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any Federal or state court in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains
available, and any appellate court thereof and (ii) irrevocably submits itself
and its property with respect to any such Proceedings to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall
be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to
any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the
laws of another state), except as otherwise provided in any applicable
commitment letter or other applicable definitive document relating to the
Financing; (c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled
affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Party in any way

 



-106- 

    

 arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment
letter relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than
any Federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York;
(d) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceedings
in any such court; (e) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any Proceedings
brought against the Financing Parties in any way arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder; (f) agrees that neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective affiliates or Representatives
(in each case, other than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (g) agrees that none of the
Financing Parties will have any liability to Seller, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise; and (h) agrees that (and each other Party hereto agrees
that) the Financing Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, any of the provisions of this Section 10.12, and such provisions and
the definition of "Financing Parties" shall not be amended in any way
materially adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior written consent
of the Financing Entities party to the Debt Commitment Letter.
