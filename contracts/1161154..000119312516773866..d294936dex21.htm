ETP Unitholder confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the Amended SXL Partnership Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, SXL shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to ETP (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units with respect to
Common Units or Series A Units for the Merger Consideration and Series A Unit
Consideration, as applicable. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than three business days following the
Effective Time, SXL will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of Common Units and Series A Units as of the Effective
Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, to make available for
collection by hand, during customary business hours commencing immediately
after the Effective Time, if so elected by such holder of record), whose
Common Units and Series A Units, as applicable, were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as
applicable, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates and Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such forms as ETP and SXL may
reasonably agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable.

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, SXL shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units and Series A Units, an amount of (x) SXL Units (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form), and (y) SXL Preferred Units (which shall be in
certificated form as set forth in the Amended SXL Partnership Agreement),
issuable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article_ _ _ _II_. Following the Effective Time, SXL agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2(g)_
, any SXL Units sufficient to pay any Merger Consideration and any SXL
Preferred Units sufficient to pay any Series A Unit Consideration, in each
case, that may be payable from time to time

 



8  following the Effective Time. All book-entry units representing SXL Units
and SXL Preferred Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including pursuant
to  _Section_ _ _ _2.2(h)_ ) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund._ " The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration and Series A
Unit Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this
_Article_ _ _ _II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included
in the Exchange Fund as directed by SXL; _provided_ , that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Common Units or Series A Units and SXL shall promptly cause to be
provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
Common Units or Series A Units in the amount of any such losses; and (ii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than 30 days.

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units and Series A Units that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or Series A
Unit Consideration, as applicable, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, a Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), or Book-Entry Unit (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) in the case of a Common Unitholder the number of SXL Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of SXL Units that such holder
has the right to receive in accordance with the provisions of this _Article_
_ _ _II_ and (ii) in the case of a Series A Unitholder, the number of SXL
Preferred Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of SXL
Preferred Units that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with
the provisions of this _Article_ _ _ _II_. The Merger Consideration and Series
A Unit Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after
receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units and letter of transmittal in
accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, Series A Unit Consideration or on any
unpaid distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration or Series
A Unit Consideration, as applicable. The Merger Consideration and Series A
Unit Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Units,
Series A Units or Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), as the case may be, formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or

 



9  Book-Entry Unit (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration on the books of ETP of transfers of Common Units
or Series A Units. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) representing Common Units or Series A Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Common Units or Series A Units, as applicable, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) are presented to the Exchange Agent or SXL, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this _Article_ _ _ _II_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders or Series A Unitholders 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to SXL, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such holders Common Units or Series A Units for
the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable, in
accordance with this _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to SXL for delivery of the Merger Consideration or Series A Unit
Consideration, as applicable, in respect of such holders Common Units or
Series A Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SXL, ETP and the Surviving
Entity shall not be liable to any Common Unitholder or Series A Unitholder
for any Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration, as applicable,
duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property
Laws. Any Merger Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration remaining
unclaimed by Common Unitholders or Series A Unitholders immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of SXL free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to SXL Units or SXL
Preferred Units issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates, or Book-Entry Units (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) until such Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) are surrendered as provided in
this _Section_ _ _ _2.2_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest,
to the record holder of the SXL Units or SXL Preferred Units, if any, issued
in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all distributions
payable in respect of any such SXL Units or SXL Preferred Units with a record
date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of
such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the distributions payable with respect to such SXL Units or SXL
Preferred Units with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of distributions in respect
of SXL Units or SXL

 



10  Preferred Units, all SXL Units or SXL Preferred Units to be issued pursuant
to the Merger shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional SXL Units or SXL Preferred Units shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, all fractional SXL Units that a holder of Common Units
converted pursuant to the Merger would otherwise be entitled to receive as
Consideration in the Merger (after taking into account all Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)) will be aggregated and then, if a
fractional SXL Unit results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the
nearest whole SXL Unit.

 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by SXL, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as SXL may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration or Series A Unit Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Common Units or Series A Units, as applicable, represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article_ _ _ _II_.

 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. SXL and the Exchange Agent may deduct and
withhold as necessary from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required,
such deduction and withholding may be taken in SXL Units). To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.
If withholding is taken in SXL Units, SXL and the Exchange Agent shall be
treated as having sold such SXL Units for an amount of cash equal to the fair
market value of such SXL Units at the time of such deemed sale and paid such
cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. ETP and SXL
each acknowledges and agrees that, for U.S. federal income and applicable
state and local tax purposes, (i) the Merger is intended to be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby SXL is
intended to be the terminating partnership and ETP is intended to be the
resulting partnership, and as a result, the Merger is intended to be treated
for U.S. federal income and applicable state and local tax purposes as (A) a
contribution of all of the assets and liabilities of SXL to ETP in exchange
for partnership interests in ETP, immediately followed by (B) a liquidating
distribution by SXL of such partnership interests in ETP to the partners of
SXL, and (ii) none of ETP, SXL, nor any partner of ETP or SXL is intended to
recognize taxable gain (other than any gain resulting from (A) any decrease in
partnership liabilities pursuant to Section 752 of the Code and (B) a
disguised sale attributable to contributions of cash or other

 



11  property to SXL after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time) (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). Unless required to do so as a result
of a "determination" as defined in Section 1313 of the Code, each of ETP and
SXL agrees not to make any tax filings or otherwise take any position
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and to cooperate with the other
party to make any filings, statements, or reports required to effect,
disclose or report the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of ETP Restricted Units, ETP Cash Units and ETP
Equity Plans_. Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the ETP
Managing GP Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any ETP
Equity Plans) and the SXL GP Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) will
adopt resolutions, and will take all other actions as may be necessary or
required in accordance with applicable Law and each ETP Equity Plan
(including, the award agreements in respect of awards granted thereunder) and
this _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ , including (i) the SXL GP Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall take all limited liability company action necessary
or advisable to assume and continue the ETP Equity Plans (including for
purposes of employing such plans to make grants of equity-based awards on SXL
Units following the Closing); (ii) the SXL GP Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall take all limited liability company action necessary
or advisable to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of SXL Units for
delivery upon vesting of a Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award or with
respect to future awards granted under the ETP Equity Plans; and (iii) the ETP
Managing GP Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all
corporate action necessary or advisable to ensure that after the Effective
Time, neither ETP nor the Surviving Entity will be required to deliver its
common units or any other securities to any person pursuant to or in
settlement of ETP Restricted Units, in each case, to give effect to this 
_Section_ _ _ _2.3_ and provide that:

(a) _Treatment of ETP Restricted Units_. Each award of restricted units
to acquire Common Units, on defined vesting dates, granted under any ETP
Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _ETP Restricted Units_ ") shall, as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any such ETP Restricted Units, cease to relate to or represent a right to
receive Common Units and shall be converted into a right to receive an award
of SXL Units (a " _Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award_ "), on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding award of ETP Restricted
Units (including the right to receive distribution equivalents with respect
to such award), except that the number of ETP Restricted Units covered by
each such Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award shall be equal to the number of
Common Units subject to the corresponding award of ETP Restricted Units
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole unit. With
respect to each ETP Restricted Unit, any distribution equivalent amounts
accrued but unpaid as of the Closing will carry over and be paid to the holder
as soon as practicable following the Closing. 

(b) _Treatment of ETP Cash Units_. Each award of cash units to receive an
amount of cash, on defined vesting dates, granted under the Energy Transfer
Partners L.P. Long-Term Incentive Cash Restricted Unit Plan (the " _ETP Cash
Unit Plan_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _ETP Cash Units_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to relate to or represent a right to receive an amount of cash based on the
fair market value of the

 



12  Common Units and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into the right
to receive an award of restricted cash units relating to SXL Units (a "
_Converted ETP Cash Unit Award_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the corresponding award of ETP Cash Units, except that the
number of notional units that upon vesting entitles the holder to receive an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of an SXL Unit shall be equal
to the number of notional Common Units related to the corresponding award of
ETP Cash Units multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole notional unit. The ETP Managing GP Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the ETP Cash Unit Plan) will adopt, prior to the
Effective Time, an amendment to the ETP Cash Unit Plan to permit the treatment
of ETP Cash Units as provided herein.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, SXL shall file a
Form S-8 registration statement (or such other appropriate form) with respect
to the SXL Units available for grant and delivery under the ETP Equity Plans
from and after the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such SXL
Units are available for grant and delivery under the ETP Equity Plans. As soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, ETP shall file a post-effective
amendment to the Form S-8 registration statements filed by ETP on September
26, 2007, June 10, 2009, December 11, 2014 and May 4, 2015, in each case,
deregistering all shares of Common Units thereunder.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article_
_ _ _II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
_Section_ _ _ _5.2_ ), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the number of outstanding Common Units, Series A Units, Class E Units,
Class G Units, Class I Units, Class J Units, Class K Units or SXL Units shall
have been changed into a different number of units or a different class by
reason of the occurrence or record date of any unit dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution,
combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, each of the Exchange
Ratio, the Series A Unit Consideration, the SXL Class E Units, the SXL Class G
Units, the SXL Class I Units, the SXL Class J Units and the SXL Class K Units
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up,
unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction and
to provide the holders of Common Units, Series A Units, Class E Units, Class G
Units, Class I Units, Class J Units and Class K Units the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger, the GP Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.5 _ETP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) ETP and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2014 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _ETP SEC Documents_ ").
The ETP SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the ETP SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other ETP SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case
may be, applicable to such ETP SEC Documents, and none of the ETP SEC
Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC staff with respect to the ETP SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of ETP,
none of the ETP SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of ETP included in the ETP SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of ETP and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations,
cash flows and changes in partners equity for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to ETP and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

 



18 (c) ETP has established and maintains internal control over
financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to ETP, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by ETP in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to ETPs principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by ETP in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. ETPs principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to ETPs auditors and the audit committee of the ETP Managing GP
Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect ETPs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for ETPs auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in ETPs internal controls. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of ETP have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the ETP SEC Documents,
and the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct
when made. The management of ETP has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of ETPs internal control over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of ETP, as of the date of this Agreement there are
no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of ETP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 (the " _Balance
Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the ETP SEC Documents
filed by ETP and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of ETP prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among ETP and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where
the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, ETP in ETPs published
financial statements or any ETP SEC Documents.

 



19 Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an ETP Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, ETP and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither ETP
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in  _Section_ _ _
_5.2(a)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , _(viii)_ , _(xiii)_ or
_(xv)_ (but, with respect to _(vii)_ , disregarding the proviso to  _Section_
_ _ _5.2(a)(vii)(A)(1)_ , and with respect to _(xv)_ , only to the extent
applicable to the other clauses designated in this _Section_ _ _ _3.6(b)(ii)_
) that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time without the prior written consent of SXL, would violate such provisions.

 

Section 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of ETP, threatened) by any
Governmental Authority with respect to ETP or any of its Subsidiaries or
actions, suits or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of ETP,
threatened) against ETP or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their

as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would

Entities hereby represent and warrant to ETP as follows:

Section 4.5 _SXL SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) SXL and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2014 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _SXL SEC Documents_ ").
The SXL SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the SXL SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other SXL SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such SXL SEC
Documents, and none of the SXL SEC Documents as of such respective dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the SXL SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of SXL, none of the SXL SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of SXL included in the SXL SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of SXL and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to SXL and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) SXL has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to SXL, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by SXL in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to SXLs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by SXL in the
reports

 



33  that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms. SXLs principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to SXLs auditors and
the audit and risk committee of the SXL GP Board (i) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect SXLs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for SXLs auditors any material weaknesses
in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
SXLs internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of SXL have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the SXL SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of SXL has completed its assessment of the effectiveness
of SXLs internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of SXL, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when
next due.

 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of SXL and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the
notes thereto) included in the SXL SEC Documents filed by SXL and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither SXL nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of SXL prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither SXL nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among SXL and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, SXL in SXLs published financial statements or any SXL SEC
Documents.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been a SXL Material Adverse
Effect.

 



34 (b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, SXL and its Subsidiaries have carried
on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither SXL
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in _Section_ _ _
_5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of SXL, would violate such
provisions.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of SXL, threatened) by any
Governmental Authority with respect to SXL or any of its Subsidiaries or
actions, suits or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of SXL,
threatened) against SXL or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority,
and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority

not have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect.

(b) SXL and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for SXL and its Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the " _SXL_ _Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the SXL Permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect. All SXL Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of SXL Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of SXL, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse
Effect. SXL and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2014 have not
been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any SXL Permit, except
where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of SXL, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of
a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of SXL or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any SXL Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any SXL Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _4.8(a)_ , SXL, each

partner, joint interest owner, consultant, agent or representative of any of

SXL, is not being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental
Authority except, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as

Effect.

 

(d) None of SXL or any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities under the
WARN Act that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material
Adverse Effect. Except for such non-compliance which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a SXL Material Adverse Effect, SXL and each
of its Subsidiaries is, and during the two year period preceding the date of
this Agreement has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws in respect of
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages
and hours and occupational safety and health (including classifications
of service providers as employees and/or independent contractors).

representations and warranties of ETP set forth in _Section_ _ _ _3.9_ , none
of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
SXL specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the

or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such rights-of-way, except for rights reserved to, or vested in,
any municipality or other Governmental Authority or any railroad by the terms

or department, as the case may be.

case, related to a sale of SXL or any of its material Subsidiaries;

(vi) adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation,
dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization (other

(viii) make, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to make, any acquisition of
any other person or business that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger;

 

(ix) engage in any activity or conduct its business in a manner that would
cause less than 90% of the gross income of SXL for any calendar quarter since
its formation and prior to the Effective Time to be treated as "qualifying
income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code; or

 

(x) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



47 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by ETP_.

 

(a) ETP shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause ETPs and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an ETP Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on
behalf of ETP or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any
Person (other than SXL and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic
data room relating to a possible ETP Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted
by this  _Section_ _ _ _5.3_ , (x) without the prior written consent of SXL,
ETP shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by
way of furnishing confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any
other action intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that
constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an ETP Alternative
Proposal, (ii) grant any waiver or release of any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any units of ETP or of any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) enter into any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of
intent, agreement in principle, unit purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement or unit exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an ETP Alternative Proposal (an " _ETP
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to SXL, the ETP
Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or
publicly approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or
adopt, any ETP Alternative Proposal, or fail to recommend against acceptance
of any tender offer or exchange offer for ETP Units within ten (10) business
days after commencement of such offer, or resolving or agreeing to take any
of the foregoing actions, and (y) subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.3(b)_ , within
five business days of receipt of a written request of SXL following the
receipt by ETP of any ETP Alternative Proposal, ETP shall publicly reconfirm
the ETP Board Recommendation; _provided_ , __ that, in the event that SXL
requests such public reconfirmation of the ETP Board Recommendation, then ETP
may not unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the five business day period) or
condition the public reconfirmation of the ETP Board Recommendation and
_provided_ , _further_ , that SXL shall not be permitted to make such request
on more than one occasion in respect of each ETP Alternative Proposal and
each material modification to an ETP Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking
of any action described in clause (x)(iii) or the failure to take the action
described in clause (y) being referred to as an " _ETP Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by ETPs Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section_ _ _ _5.3_
by ETP unless such violation is committed without the Knowledge of ETP and ETP
uses its reasonable best efforts to promptly cure such violation once ETP is
made aware of such violation.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ _ _
_5.3(a)_ , if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the ETP Unitholder Approval, (i) ETP has received a written ETP
Alternative Proposal that the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation
of the ETP Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide, (ii) the ETP Managing
GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts Committee), after

 



48  consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that (A) such ETP Alternative Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an ETP Superior Proposal
and (B) failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties
under the ETP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and (iii) such ETP
Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of this  _Section_
_ _ _5.3_ , then ETP may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish
information, including confidential information, with respect to ETP and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such ETP Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such ETP Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ that (x) ETP will not, and will use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person unless ETP has, or first enters into, a
confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions
that are not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the SXL
Confidentiality Agreement are to SXL and (y) ETP will provide to SXL non-
public information about ETP or its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided or made available to SXL prior to or substantially concurrently with
providing or making available such non-public information to such
other Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of ETP set forth in this _Section_
_ _ _5.3_ , ETP shall promptly advise SXL, orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, ETP
in respect of any ETP Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
SXL, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry
or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or
the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall
promptly keep SXL reasonably informed of all material developments affecting
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and
ETP shall promptly provide SXL with copies of any additional written materials
received by ETP or that ETP has delivered to any third party making an ETP
Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the ETP Unitholder Approval, the ETP Managing GP Board and
the ETP Conflicts Committee may effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an ETP Alternative Proposal or an ETP Changed Circumstance if the
ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts
Committee), after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its duties under the ETP Partnership Agreement or
applicable Law and:

(i) if the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP
Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such ETP Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to an ETP Alternative Proposal:

 

A. such ETP Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

 



49 B. the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts
Committee) has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that such ETP Alternative Proposal constitutes an ETP
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments offered
by SXL pursuant to clause (E) below;

C. ETP has provided prior written notice to SXL in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _8.9_ (the " _ETP Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the ETP
Managing GP Boards intention to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change,
and such ETP Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the
Person making such ETP Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions
of such ETP Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal
or offers (including proposed agreements) received by ETP in connection with
such ETP Alternative Proposal;

D. during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the ETP
Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _8.9_
and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _ETP Superior Proposal Notice
Period_ "), ETP shall (1) negotiate with SXL in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
ETP Managing GP Board not to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(2) keep SXL reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in the
material terms and conditions of such ETP Alternative Proposal or other change
in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any material
revisions to such ETP Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any change in
the purchase price in such ETP Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material
revision) shall require delivery of a subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice
and a subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such
revised ETP Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent ETP Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the
initial ETP Superior Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time
on the date that is the third calendar day following the date of the delivery
of such subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice; and

 

E. the ETP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by SXL and, at the end
of the ETP Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good
faith that (i) such ETP Alternative Proposal continues to constitute an ETP
Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii)
failure to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its duties under the ETP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law even if
such revisions were to be given effect; or

 



50 (ii) if the ETP Managing GP Board intends to effect such ETP Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an ETP Changed Circumstance:

A. ETP shall provide prior written notice to SXL in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _8.9_ (the " _ETP Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the ETP
Managing GP Boards intention to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change,
and such ETP Recommendation Change Notice shall specify the details of such
ETP Changed Circumstance and the reasons for the ETP Adverse Recommendation
Change;

 

B. during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the ETP
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _ETP Recommendation
Change Notice Period_ "), ETP shall (i) negotiate with SXL in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the ETP Managing GP Board, not to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation
Change; and (ii) keep SXL reasonably informed of any change in circumstances
related thereto; and

C. the ETP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the
terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by SXL and, at the end
of the ETP Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined
(upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts Committee) in good faith that
the failure to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under the ETP Partnership Agreement or applicable
Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ETP or the ETP
Managing GP Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an ETP Alternative
Proposal if the ETP Managing GP Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that
any ETP Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that
describes ETPs receipt of an ETP Alternative Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an ETP Adverse
Recommendation Change.

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
_Section_ _ _ _5.4(d)_ ), each of the SXL Entities, on the one hand, and the
ETP Entities, on the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts
to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done,
all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of

 



51  information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain promptly
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seek to
have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith and
use their reasonable best efforts to pursue and facilitate possible
alternative transaction structures to those contemplated by this Agreement to
the extent necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining third party
consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
but no party shall have any obligation to undertake any alternative
transaction structure that is materially adverse to any party or such partys
unitholders or members, as the case may be.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing (if required) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 15 business days after the date of this
Agreement or any later date on which the parties agree that there is an HSR
filing requirement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties
hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section_ _ _ _5.4_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act and to obtain approvals or consents under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date); and (ii) ETP and SXL shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) if any state takeover statute or
similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transaction.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a private
Person, (ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other
party) any communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and any material communication
received or given in connection with

 



52  any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review in
advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any
communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the other party in
advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.6(b)_ , the parties
shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.4_ in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) SXL and ETP (including by causing their respective Subsidiaries) agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve any objections that a
Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than the Outside Date, and including offering,
accepting and agreeing to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of ETPs,
SXLs or their respective Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets (or a
combination thereof) or (B) restrict the manner in which SXL, ETP or any of
their respective Subsidiaries may carry on business in any part of the world.
Neither SXL nor ETP shall, without the other partys prior written consent,
commit to any disposal, hold separate, or other restriction related to its or
its Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets.

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by SXL and ETP. Thereafter, neither ETP nor SXL
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may
be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or
other national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of
the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party); _provided,
however_ , that ETP shall not be required by this _Section_ _ _ _5.5_ to
consult with any other party with respect to a public announcement in
connection with the receipt and existence of an ETP Alternative Proposal that
the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts
Committee) believes is bona fide and matters related thereto or an ETP Adverse
Recommendation Change but nothing in this proviso shall limit any obligation
of ETP under _Section_ _ _ _5.3(d)_ to negotiate with SXL in good faith;
_provided, further_ , that each party and their respective controlled
affiliates may make statements that are consistent with statements made in
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by SXL
or ETP in compliance with this _Section_ _ _ _5.5_.

 



53 Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries
properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in
each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Each party
shall furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule
and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement). Except for disclosure permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 15, 2016, between SXL and ETP
(as it may be amended from time to time, the " _SXL
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its Representatives shall hold
information received from the other party pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.6_
in confidence in accordance with the terms of the SXL Confidentiality
Agreement. 

(b) This _Section_ _ _ _5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of
such party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
contract or Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such
party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined
with respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could
in such partys good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys
position in any pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent
thereto; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information
(including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the
extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of
any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which
appropriately designated Representatives of the other party shall be provided
access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being
requested to disclose the information shall (1) notify the other party that
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (2) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the

 



54  first proviso in this _Section_ _ _ _5.6(b)_ ) and (3) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract). 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section_ _
_ _5.6_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties
hereto.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. ETP shall give prompt
notice to SXL, and SXL shall give prompt notice to ETP, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to ETP or SXL, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions
to the Closing in _Article_ _ _ _VI_ and (iv) any material failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied
of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ _ _ _VI_ ; _provided_
that, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the failure to comply with this 
_Section_ _ _ _5.7_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of
the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ _ _ _VI_ , or give rise to any
right to terminate this Agreement under  _Article_ _ _ _VII_ , if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _5.8_ , (i) " _Indemnified Person_
" shall mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior
to the Effective Time, an officer or director of ETP, ETP Managing GP, SXL,
SXL GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries and also with respect to any
such Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether
or not such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with ETP) serving at the
request of or on behalf of ETP, ETP Managing GP, SXL, SXL GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether or not such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or
criminal litigation or regulatory action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that ETP, ETP
GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would be permitted to indemnify an
Indemnified Person, SXL and SXL GP agree to (i) indemnify and hold harmless
against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in

 



55  settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in connection with
any Proceeding, and provide advancement promptly, and in any event within 10
days after any written request, of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the ETP
Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP GP and any
Subsidiary of ETP or ETP GP immediately prior to the Effective Time
and ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Entity and SXL
GP shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers and agents
of ETP, ETP GP and their respective Subsidiaries than are presently set forth
in the ETP Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP GP
(it being acknowledged and agreed that the provisions of the SXL Charter
Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP GP currently in effect
are no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation of such Persons than are presently in the ETP Charter
Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP GP). Any right of
indemnification of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ _ _
_5.8(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in
a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as
provided herein.

(c) The Surviving Entity and the GP Surviving Entity shall maintain in
effect for six years from the Effective Time ETPs and ETP Managing GPs
current directors and officers liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Entity or the GP Surviving
Entity may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable
to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Entity or the GP Surviving Entity be required to expend pursuant
to this  _Section_ _ _ _5.8(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of
current annual premiums paid by ETP or ETP Managing GP for such insurance (the
" _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity or the GP Surviving
Entity would be required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving
Entity or the GP Surviving Entity shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If ETP or ETP Managing GP
in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of SXL and the
GP Surviving Entity under this _Section_ _ _ _5.8(c)_ , ETP or ETP Managing GP
may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective

Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)

_xii)_ ) and shall not be required to provide information if doing so would be
reasonably expected to threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege
or other applicable legal privilege.

Section 5.10 _Financing Matters_.

 

(a) ETP hereby consents to SXLs use of and reliance on any audited or
unaudited financial statements relating to ETP and its consolidated

expense, to obtain the consents of any auditor to the inclusion of the
financial statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the SEC.
Prior to the Closing, ETP will provide such assistance (and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective personnel and advisors to provide
such assistance), as SXL may reasonably request in order to assist SXL in
connection with financing activities, including any public offerings to be
registered under the Securities Act or private offerings. Such assistance
shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) providing such
information, and making available such personnel as SXL may reasonably
request; (ii) participation in, and assistance with, any marketing activities
related to such financing; (iii) participation by senior management of ETP in,
and their assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and
meetings with rating agencies; (iv) taking such actions as are reasonably
requested by SXL or its financing sources to facilitate the satisfaction of

Units (including derivative securities with respect to SXL Units) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to ETP, or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to SXL, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Effective Time, each of SXL and ETP shall coordinate with the other regarding
the declaration of any distributions in respect of SXL Units, Common Units and
Series A Units and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it
being the intention of the parties that holders of Common Units or Series A
Units shall not receive, for any quarter, distributions both in respect of
Common Units or Series A Units and also distributions in respect of SXL Units
or SXL Preferred Units, as the case may be, that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for any such quarter

or remove or cause the removal of any director of the ETP Managing GP Board
that is a member of the ETP Conflicts Committee either as a member of the ETP
Managing GP Board or the ETP Conflicts Committee, without the affirmative vote
of the ETP Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ _ _

provisions of the ETP Managing GP Agreement.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, none of the SXL Entities shall, without

death, incapacity or resignation of any director in accordance with the
provisions of the SXL GP Agreement.

(a) ETE covenants and agrees that, until the Effective Time or the earlier
of a termination of this Agreement, at the ETP Unitholders Meeting or any
other meeting of ETP Limited Partners or any vote of ETP Limited Partner
Interests in connection with a vote of the ETP Limited Partners, however
called, ETE will vote, or cause to be voted, all ETP Limited

Subsidiaries, as of the record date for such meeting, in favor of the approval
of this Agreement (as it may be amended or otherwise modified from time to

thereof. ETE consents to, and has caused or shall cause, to the extent
necessary and to the extent permitted by the organizational documents thereof,
each of its Subsidiaries to consent to, this Agreement, the Amended SXL
Partnership Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) ETP hereby (i) irrevocably consents, in its capacity as the sole
member of SXL GP, for all purposes, to this Agreement, the Amended SXL
Partnership Agreement (including each amendment set forth therein) and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with such consent constituting

and (ii) acknowledges that no amendment contained in the Amended SXL
Partnership Agreement is adverse to SXL GP, as the holder of the SXL GP
Interest and SXL Incentive Distribution Rights.

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (A) an ETP Alternative Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the
time of, the date of the ETP Unitholders Meeting (or, if the ETP Unitholders
Meeting shall not have occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ [ _Outside Date_ ]), (B) this
Agreement is terminated by ETP or SXL pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(_ _i_

transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by SXL.

interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in Section 2301
of Title 6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if ETP shall fail to pay the
ETP Termination Fee when due, ETP shall also pay all of SXLs reasonable costs

this  _Section_ _ _ _7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, neither the ETP
Entities nor the SXL Entities would enter into this Agreement. The parties
agree that in the event that ETP pays the ETP Termination Fee to SXL, no ETP
Entity shall have any further liability to any SXL Entity of any kind in
respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that
in no event shall ETP be required to pay the ETP Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event of termination of this Agreement by (i) either party pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed ETP_ _Unitholder_ _Vote_ ] (or a

at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed ETP_ _Unitholder_ _Vote_ ]) or (ii) SXL pursuant to 
_Section_ _ _ _7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _ETP Willful Breach_ ], then ETP shall promptly,
but in no event later than three business days after receipt of an invoice
(with supporting documentation) therefor from SXL, pay SXLs designee all of
the reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources,
hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred by SXL and its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of $30.0 million (the " _SXL
Expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall ETP have any
obligation to make any such payment if, at the time of such termination, this
Agreement was terminable by ETP pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _7.1(d)(_ _i_ _)_ [
_SXL Uncured Breach_ ].

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and 

 



67  obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits
with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this  _Section_ _ _ _8.7_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt
or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this  _Section_ _ _ _8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery
or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ _ _ _8.8_ ,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The
parties agree that in the event that SXL receives the ETP Termination Fee,
SXL may not seek any award of specific performance under this _Section_ _ _
_8.8_.
