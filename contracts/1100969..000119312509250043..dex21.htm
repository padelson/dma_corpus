v BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT

This BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of December 4, 2009 by and among AsiaInfo Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("AsiaInfo"), Linkage Technologies International Holdings Limited,
a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Linkage"), certain
shareholders of Linkage listed in _Exhibit A-1_ (each individually, a "Key
Linkage Shareholder" and collectively, the "Key Linkage Shareholders") and
Libin Sun as agent for the shareholders of Linkage (the "Shareholders
Agent").

RECITALS

A. AsiaInfo and Linkage are leading providers of software solutions and
information technology services for the telecommunications industry in China.

B. The Linkage Board and the AsiaInfo Board believe it is advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and the shareholders of their
respective companies that AsiaInfo and Linkage combine their respective
operations through Linkages sale of, and AsiaInfos purchase of, 100% of the
outstanding share capital of Linkages wholly-owned Subsidiary, Linkage
Technologies Investment Limited, a company organized under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands (the "Company"), with the Company continuing as a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of AsiaInfo (the "Combination").

C. The Linkage Board and the AsiaInfo Board have accordingly approved the
Combination. 

D. Pursuant to the Combination, among other things, AsiaInfo shall purchase
all of the outstanding ordinary shares, US$0.10 par value per share, of the
Company (the "Linkage BVI Shares"), which represents all of the Companys
outstanding share capital, and pay the Consideration (as defined in Section
1.1(b)) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

E. Linkage, AsiaInfo and the Key Linkage Shareholders desire to make certain
representations and warranties and other agreements in connection with the
Combination.

F. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the
meaning provided to them in _Attachment 1_.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and
receipt of which the parties hereby acknowledge, the parties agree as follows:



 

1 ARTICLE 1

_PURCHASE AND SALE OF LINKAGE BVI SHARES_

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Linkage BVI Shares; Issuance of Consideration_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AsiaInfo (directly
or through any of its Group Companies) agrees to purchase, and Linkage agrees
to sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to AsiaInfo (or its designated
Group Company), at the Closing, 9,288 Linkage BVI Shares, representing all of
the outstanding share capital of the Company, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. The Linkage BVI Shares sold to AsiaInfo (or its designated Group
Company) pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the
"Shares." 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the aggregate
purchase price payable by AsiaInfo (directly or through any of its Group
Companies) to Linkage for the Shares shall be equal to (i) US$60 million (the
"Cash Consideration") and (ii) 26,832,731 shares of common stock of AsiaInfo
("AsiaInfo Common Stock"), par value US$ 0.01 per share (the "Stock
Consideration," and together with the Cash Consideration, the
"Consideration"). The Consideration shall be subject to a pre-closing
adjustment as contemplated by Section 1.8, and the adjustment contemplated in
Section 6.2(o), in which event the terms "Cash Consideration," "Stock
Consideration" and "Consideration" shall refer to the Cash Consideration, the
Stock Consideration and the Consideration, respectively, as adjusted in
accordance with Sections 1.8 and/or 6.2(o) hereof and used accordingly.

(c) The Stock Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to AsiaInfo Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof but prior to the Closing.

1.2 _Closing_.

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing")
shall take place as soon as practicable, but no later than two (2) Business
Days, after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 hereof, or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of DLA Piper,
20th Floor, South Tower, Beijing Kerry Center, No. 1 Guanghua Road, Chaoyang
District, Beijing PRC, or at such other location as the parties hereto agree.

(b) At the Closing, AsiaInfo (directly or through any of its Group Companies)
shall deliver to Linkage (i) certificates representing the Stock
Consideration, which Stock Consideration shall be free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except for Encumbrances under the Escrow Agreement, the Lock-Up
Agreements, the Stockholders Agreement, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") and state securities laws or the securities
laws of any applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction, in genuine and unaltered form,
to be distributed by Linkage to the Legacy Linkage Shareholders in the
proportions set forth as percentages opposite 



 

2  such Legacy Linkage Shareholders names under the heading "Number of Shares
of AsiaInfo Common Stock to be Received" in _Exhibit A-2_ (the "Stock
Consideration Distribution Schedule") and (ii) the Cash Consideration by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Linkage specified in
wire instructions provided to AsiaInfo, for the benefit of the Legacy Linkage
Shareholders, in the proportions set forth as percentages opposite such
Legacy Linkage Shareholders names under the heading "Percentage of Cash
Consideration to be Received" in _Exhibit A-2_ (the "Cash Consideration
Distribution Schedule," and together with the Stock Consideration
Distribution Schedule, the "Consideration Distribution Schedules"); _provided_
, that 10% of the aggregate Consideration (consisting of US$6 million in cash
and 2,683,273 shares of AsiaInfo Common Stock) (collectively, the "Escrow
Amount") shall be delivered by AsiaInfo to the Escrow Agent under an escrow
agreement to be entered into on the Closing Date by AsiaInfo, Linkage,
the Shareholders Agent and the Escrow Agent substantially in the form of
_Exhibit B_ hereto (with such reasonable modifications as the Escrow Agent
may require) (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Amount shall be adjusted
proportionally for any pre-closing adjustment to the Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.8. Simultaneously at the Closing, Linkage will assign and transfer
to AsiaInfo (or its designated Group Company) all right, title and interest
in the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, as evidenced by (y) a duly
executed instrument of transfer with respect to the Shares, and (z) a copy of
the updated register of members of the Company, certified by the registered
agent of the Company in the British Virgin Islands reflecting the conveyance
to AsiaInfo (or its designated Group Company) of the Shares being purchased by
AsiaInfo (or its designated Group Company) at the Closing. Each Legacy Linkage
Shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of AsiaInfo Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of AsiaInfo Common Stock multiplied by (ii) US$24.07, and the cash
amount to which such Legacy Linkage Shareholder would otherwise have been
entitled to receive shall be reduced accordingly.

1.3 _Post-Signing Events_. The parties acknowledge that, prior to the Closing,
(i) Mr. Libin Sun may transfer all of his shares in Linkage to LT
International Limited and (ii) Linkage may agree to distribute 100% of the
Consideration payable to Golden Eagle International Retail Group Limited
pursuant to the Consideration Distribution Schedules and the Escrow
Distribution Schedule, at the Closing. In the event (i) and/or (ii) occur,
the parties agree to revise the Consideration Distribution Schedule and the
Escrow Distribution Schedule accordingly.

1.4 _Escrow_. The Escrow Amount delivered by AsiaInfo (or its designated Group
Company) at Closing pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be held in an
escrow fund (together with the earnings thereon, the "Escrow Fund") and shall
serve as security for any post-closing adjustments pursuant to Sections 1.9
and the indemnification obligations of the Linkage Parties hereunder. Releases
from the Escrow Fund will be permitted only in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement. If there are no outstanding claims for
indemnification by AsiaInfo as of the date that is eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"), the Escrow Amount
shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent on such date to the Legacy Linkage 



 

3  Shareholders in the proportions set forth as percentages opposite such
Legacy Linkage Shareholders names under the heading "Percentage of Escrow
Distribution" in _Exhibit A-3_ (the "Escrow Distribution Schedule"),
representing the pro rata interest of each such Legacy Linkage Shareholder in
the Escrow Fund. If there are outstanding claims for indemnification by
AsiaInfo on the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Amount, less any amount
subject to such outstanding claims, shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent
on such date, to the Legacy Linkage Shareholders in accordance with the Escrow
Distribution Schedule; _provided_ , that the remaining balance of the Escrow
Amount shall be distributed to the Legacy Linkage Shareholders in accordance
with the Escrow Distribution Schedule upon final satisfaction of such
outstanding claims in accordance with Article 8. All fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent shall be deducted and paid from the cash portion of the Escrow
Fund. Final distribution of the Escrow Fund shall be made net of any accrued
fees and expenses then outstanding. In connection with any such distribution,
each Legacy Linkage Shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of AsiaInfo Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) from the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of AsiaInfo Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) US$24.07, and the cash amount to which such Legacy Linkage
Shareholder would otherwise have been entitled to receive shall be reduced
accordingly. If there is no cash remaining in the Escrow Fund, or if there is
insufficient cash to effectuate the foregoing, after consultation with
AsiaInfo, the Shareholders Agent may deliver to the Escrow Agent a modified
Escrow Distribution Schedule, which reallocates such fractions of shares as
equitably as reasonably practicable amongst the Legacy Linkage Shareholders.

1.5 _Lock-Up Agreements_. In respect of the AsiaInfo Common Stock issued as
part of the Stock Consideration, (a) on the date hereof, each Key Linkage
Shareholder shall each enter into a lock-up agreement with AsiaInfo
substantially in the form of  _Exhibit C_ (the "Lock-Up Agreement")
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement to become effective as of
the Closing, and (b) on or prior to the Closing Date, other Legacy Linkage
Shareholders collectively owning at least 95% of the Linkage Shares held by
such other Legacy Linkage Shareholders shall enter into Lock-Up Agreements.
Edward Tian shall also enter into a Lock-Up Agreement in respect of the
AsiaInfo Common Stock he owns as of the Closing. 

1.6 _Registration Rights Agreements_. On the Closing Date, AsiaInfo shall
enter into a registration rights agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit D_ with LT International Limited (the "Registration Rights
Agreement").

1.7 _Distribution of Consideration_. The Linkage Parties shall take
commercially reasonable steps to distribute all of the Consideration received
by Linkage (less any cash required by the Company to meet its outstanding
obligations and other than the Escrow Amount) simultaneously with the
Closing, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the Legacy Linkage
Shareholders in accordance with their respective entitlements under the
Consideration Distribution Schedule. If and to the extent the Linkage Parties
are unable to cause the Consideration to be distributed simultaneously with
the Closing as contemplated in the foregoing sentence, Linkage will hold the
Consideration in trust for the benefit of the Legacy Linkage Shareholders and
shall refrain from 



 

4  exercising any voting rights associated with the AsiaInfo Common Stock
comprising the Stock Consideration other than in accordance with the
Stockholders Agreement. Until the Stock Consideration (other than the
AsiaInfo Common Stock that is part of the Escrow Amount) is delivered to the
shareholders of Linkage, (a) the Linkage Parties acknowledge and agree that
such shares of AsiaInfo Common Stock may not be voted, and (b) AsiaInfo shall
not be required to recognize any votes cast at any annual or special meeting
of AsiaInfo stockholders, or any other stockholder action taken, with respect
to any shares of AsiaInfo Common Stock comprising all or any part of the
Stock Consideration.

1.8 _Pre-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) The Consideration to be paid at the Closing shall be subject to adjustment
in accordance with this Section 1.8.

(b) For purposes of this Section 1.8, the following terms shall have the
meanings ascribed herein:

(i) "Actual New Customer Order Amount" means the aggregate U.S. dollar amount
of New Customer Orders as of January 15, 2010 (calculated at an RMB/USD
exchange rate of 6.8287), net of (A) third party pass-through costs (including
all third party hardware, software, services and other pass-through costs),
and (B) any sales tax, VAT, PRC business tax or similar Taxes paid or to be
paid in connection with such New Customer Orders.

(ii) "New Customer Orders" means bona fide, written and fully-executed
contracts and all exhibits and appendices thereto, bearing the customers
corporate chop and initialed by the designated signatory of the customer on
each page, representing customer orders (i) entered into during the period
commencing on October 1, 2009 and before 12:00 a.m. (Beijing time) on January
16, 2010, (ii) for goods and services to be performed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or before December 31, 2010, and (iii) relating to the New
Order Statements delivered to AsiaInfo prior to 6:00 p.m. (Beijing time) on
January 18, 2010.

(c) If the Actual New Customer Order Amount is less than US$40 million, the
Consideration shall be reduced by US$4.00 for every US$1.00 by which the
Actual New Customer Order Amount is less than US$40 million. For example, if
the Actual New Customer Order Amount is US$38 million, the Consideration shall
be reduced by US$8 million. Any adjustment described in this Section 1.8(c)
shall be applied to Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration in a
proportionate reduction, valuing AsiaInfo Common Stock for the purpose of this
Agreement at US$24.07 per share.

(d) To calculate the Actual New Customer Order Amount, the parties agree:

(i) Linkage shall prepare or cause to be prepared a statement in a form
reasonably acceptable to AsiaInfo that includes without limitation information
related to each relevant customer, contract ID, contract amount and third
party pass-through costs 



 

5  (the "New Order Statement") which must be (i) delivered to AsiaInfo on or
prior to January 18, 2010 at 6:00 p.m. (Beijing Time), (ii) signed by Linkage
and its chief executive officer attesting to the Actual New Customer Order
Amount, and (iii) supported by fully-executed copies of the corresponding New
Customer Orders. Linkage acknowledges that AsiaInfo may, at its election and
at its sole expense, designate representatives to Linkages principal
executive offices in Nanjing to verify the New Order Statement on or about
January 16, 2010 by examining the original New Customer Orders, and Linkage
shall make reasonable accommodations to permit such a review.

(ii) In the event that AsiaInfo objects to any aspect of the New Order
Statement or requires further information in order to confirm the New
Customer Orders contained therein, then within 20 days after the delivery to
AsiaInfo of the New Order Statement (the "Response Period"), AsiaInfo shall
deliver to Linkage a written notice (a "Request Notice") requesting
additional information from Linkage that AsiaInfo requires in order to confirm
the New Customer Orders and the Actual New Customer Order Amount (which
information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order to confirm the
Actual New Customer Order Amount, shall be provided by Linkage within 15 days
after Linkages receipt of such request).

(iii) If AsiaInfo does not deliver a Request Notice to Linkage during the
Response Period, then Linkages calculation of the amounts set forth in the
New Order Statement shall be binding and conclusive on Linkage, the Key
Linkage Shareholders and AsiaInfo.

(iv) If AsiaInfo delivers a Request Notice to Linkage for additional
information as described above during the Response Period, then AsiaInfo shall
have an additional 20 days after receiving from Linkage all of the information
reasonably requested by AsiaInfo and required in order for AsiaInfo to
confirm the information set forth in the New Order Statement (the "Final
Response Period") to deliver to Linkage a written notice (a "Final Objection
Notice") describing in reasonable detail AsiaInfos objections to Linkages
New Order Statement accompanied by a statement setting forth its view of the
New Customer Orders and the Actual New Customer Order Amount determined by
AsiaInfo to be correct.

(v) AsiaInfo and Linkage shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any
differences in the New Order Statement and the Final Objection Notice between
themselves. If AsiaInfo and Linkage do not reach a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after Linkage has received the Final Objection Notice, then
AsiaInfo and Linkage shall submit such dispute to a "Big Four"
accounting firm other than Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or its member firms (an
"Accounting Referee") who shall be entitled to request any additional
information and use its discretion to determine the New Customer Order and the
Actual New Customer Order Amount it believes to be correct. In the event any
informational requests are not adequately addressed by Linkage within a
reasonable period of time, the Accounting Referee shall be entitled to
disallow any related New Customer Order. The findings of the Accounting
Referee shall be binding and conclusive on Linkage, the Key Linkage
Shareholders and AsiaInfo.



 

6 (vi) In the event the parties submit any unresolved objections to an
Accounting Referee for resolution as provided in Section 1.8(d)(v) above,
AsiaInfo and Linkage shall share responsibility for the fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee equally.

(i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, members of the legacy
AsiaInfo and legacy Linkage finance teams within the AsiaInfo-Linkage finance
department will prepare in good faith and deliver to the Shareholders Agent,
on behalf of the Legacy Linkage Shareholders, a draft balance sheet (the
"Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet") for the Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, upon which AsiaInfo shall include AsiaInfos
calculation of (A) the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Actual
Working Capital") and (B) the Net Debt as of the Closing Date (the "Actual
Net Debt"). Members of the legacy AsiaInfo and legacy Linkage finance teams
within the AsiaInfo-Linkage finance department will prepare the Draft Closing
Date Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the Utah Financial Statements; _provided_ , _however_
, that assets, liabilities, gains, losses, revenues, and expenses in interim
periods or as of dates other than year-end (which normally are determined
through the application of so-called interim accounting conventions or
procedures) shall be determined, for purposes of the Draft Closing Date
Balance Sheet, through full application of the procedures used in preparing
the most recent reviewed balance sheet included within the Linkage Financial
Statements.

(ii) If the Shareholders Agent has any objections to the Draft Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Shareholders Agent shall deliver a detailed statement
describing such objections to AsiaInfo within thirty (30) days after receiving
the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet. AsiaInfo and the Shareholders Agent
shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections themselves. If
AsiaInfo and the Shareholders Agent do not obtain a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after AsiaInfo has received the statement of objections,
however, AsiaInfo and the Shareholders Agent shall submit such dispute to an
Accounting Referee. AsiaInfo shall revise the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet
as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant
to this Section 1.9(a)(ii). The "Closing Date Balance Sheet" shall mean the
Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet together with any revisions thereto pursuant
to this Section 1.9(a)(ii). 

(iii) In the event the parties submit any unresolved objections to an
Accounting Referee for resolution as provided in Section 1.9(a)(ii) above,
AsiaInfo and the Key Linkage Shareholders shall share responsibility for the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee equally.

(iv) AsiaInfo will make the work papers and back-up materials used in
preparing the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet available to the Shareholders
Agent and the Shareholders Agents accountant and other representatives at
reasonable times and 



 

7  upon reasonable notice at any time during (A) the review by the
Shareholders Agent of the Draft Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (B) the
resolution by the Shareholders Agent and AsiaInfo of any objections thereto.

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment based on Working Capital_.

(i) If Actual Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, then
AsiaInfo shall instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to deliver to AsiaInfo
out of the Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the amount by which Actual
Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital (the "Working Capital
Shortfall").

(ii) Any payment pursuant to Section 1.9(b)(i) shall be made by wire transfer
or delivery of other immediately available funds within three (3) Business
Days after the Escrow Agents receipt of the written instructions from
AsiaInfo contemplated in that Section.

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustment based on Net Debt._

(i) If Actual Net Debt is greater than Target Net Debt, then AsiaInfo shall
instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to deliver to AsiaInfo out of the Escrow
Fund an amount equal to the amount by which Actual Net Debt is greater than
the Target Net Debt (the "Net Debt Surplus").

(ii) Any payment pursuant to Section 1.9(c)(i) shall be made by wire transfer
or delivery of other immediately available funds within three (3) Business
Days after the Escrow Agents receipt of the written instructions from
AsiaInfo contemplated in that Section.

(d) _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if a change in any balance sheet item or items causes (x) a
Working Capital Shortfall (or increases the amount of a Working Capital
Shortfall) _and_ (y) a Net Debt Surplus (or increases the amount of a Net Debt
Surplus), AsiaInfo shall only be entitled to a purchase price adjustment
based on one, and not both, of subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 1.9.

the Combination-Related Transactions will not, conflict with or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under: (i) the Linkage Charter Documents; (ii) subject to the

adverse effect on the ability of the Linkage Parties to consummate the
Combination-Related Transactions.

(d) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required by or with
respect to Linkage or any of its Group Companies in connection with the

12 2.5 _Financial Statements_.

(a) True and complete copies of the following have been delivered by Linkage
to AsiaInfo: (i) the consolidated audited balance sheet of Linkage for each
of the fiscal years ended as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and
the consolidated audited statements of income, shareholders equity and cash
flows of Linkage for each of the three years ended December 31, 2008,
December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, together with the notes and
schedules to such financial statements, accompanied by the report thereon of

(b) The Linkage Financial Statements and the Linkage Interim Financial
Statements (i) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved except as may otherwise be indicated in the notes thereto or,
in the case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by GAAP, (ii)
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
condition and results of operations of Linkage and its Group Companies as of
the dates thereof or for the periods covered thereby, except as otherwise
noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to (x)
the absence of footnotes and (y) year-end adjustments, the effect of which,
individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to Linkage and its
Group Companies, taken as a whole), and (iii) fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of
Linkage as of the dates thereof or for the periods covered thereby, except as
otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited financial

statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or

operation of, and changes in, Linkages internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Linkages
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information.
Linkage and its Group Companies do not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Linkages internal control over financial reporting.

Governmental Authority has any contractual rights or obligations;

(x) any contract or agreement not otherwise described that would reasonably
be expected to have a Linkage Material Adverse Effect if breached by Linkage
or any of its Group Companies in such a manner as would (1) permit any other

Equitable Exceptions; and (ii) none of Linkage, any applicable Group Company
of Linkage, or, to the knowledge of Linkage and its Group Companies, any other
party is in breach or default in any material respect, and no event has
occurred that with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a breach or

Contract. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Linkage
Material Adverse Effect, Linkage or the applicable Group Company has paid in
full all amounts due under the Linkage Material Contracts that are due and

in both type and amount and (iii) liabilities that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Linkage and its

businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, and there has not been (i) any action, event or occurrence which
has had, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Linkage Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) any other action, event or occurrence that would have
required the consent of AsiaInfo pursuant to Section 4.1 had such action,
event or occurrence taken place after the date of this Agreement.

as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b-4 under the
Exchange Act at all times prior to the Closing.

(b) _Illiquid Shares; Restriction on Resales_. The Linkage Parties
acknowledge that the AsiaInfo Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
has not been, and when issued, will not be registered under the Securities
Act, the securities laws of any state of the United States or the securities
laws of any other country. To the extent that the Securities Act is
applicable, the AsiaInfo Common Stock may not be sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or
unless an exemption from 



 

31  registration is available. In the absence of an effective registration
statement covering such shares, to the extent that the Securities Act applies,
the Linkage Parties acknowledge that they may sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of such shares only in a transaction for which an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act is available. Each Linkage Party further
understands that there is no assurance that any exemption from registration
under the Securities Act will be available or, if available, that such
exemption will allow such Seller to dispose of or otherwise transfer any or
all of the Shares under the circumstances, in the amounts or at the times such
Seller might propose. The Linkage Parties understand and acknowledge that the
certificate(s) evidencing the AsiaInfo Common Stock to be issued or delivered
pursuant to Combination-Related Transactions shall bear AsiaInfos standard
form of Securities Act restrictive legend, as well as legends describing any
applicable contractual restrictions. The Linkage Parties understand that each
Linkage Party may have to bear the economic risk of an investment in AsiaInfo
Common Stock to be received by each Linkage Party pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby for an indefinite period of time.

(c) _Accredited Investor; Investment Intent_. Each Linkage Party is either
(i) an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities
Act), or (ii) a Person that, at the time the buy order (within the meaning of
Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act) for the AsiaInfo Common
Stock to be received hereunder was originated, was outside the United States
and was not a "U.S. person" (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit
of a U.S. person) within the meaning of Regulation S, and no offer, within
the meaning of Regulation S, was made to such Linkage Party (or any other
Person on its behalf) in the United States. Each Linkage Party either alone or
with his, her, or its representative, is capable of evaluating the risks and
merits of owning the AsiaInfo Common Stock. Each Linkage Party is acquiring
the AsiaInfo Common Stock for investment only and not with a view to or
intention of or in connection with any resale or distribution of such shares
or any interest therein in violation of the Securities Act.

(d) _Unregistered Securities_. Each of the Linkage Parties has been advised
and acknowledges that in issuing the AsiaInfo Common Stock to such Person
pursuant hereto, AsiaInfo is relying upon the exemption from registration
provided Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated
thereunder and/or upon Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act.

Schedule) does not, and the certificate referred to in Section 6.2(a) will
not, (i) contain any representation or warranty that is false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or (ii) omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the representations and warranties contained and to
be contained herein and therein (in the light of the circumstances under which
such representations and warranties were or will be made or provided) not
false or misleading.

and warranties contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules and

Representatives, nor any other 



 

32  Person, makes or shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty

the Linkage Parties by this Agreement disclaim any such representation or
warranty, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to AsiaInfo or any other
Person of any documentation or other information by the Linkage Parties or any
of their Representatives or any other Person with respect to any one or more
of the foregoing.

case as of its date, or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and none of the AsiaInfo
SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no material unresolved
comments issued by the staff of the SEC with respect to any of the AsiaInfo
SEC Reports.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the AsiaInfo SEC

with all applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) is in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved except as may
otherwise be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q promulgated by the
SEC, and (iii) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of AsiaInfo and its Group Companies as of the dates
indicated and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are

(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. AsiaInfos disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by AsiaInfo in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to AsiaInfos management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. AsiaInfos management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of AsiaInfos disclosure controls and 



 

39  procedures and, to the extent required by applicable law, presented in any

financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of

the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect AsiaInfos ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) AsiaInfo does not
have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in AsiaInfos
internal control over financial reporting.

Combination-Related Transactions.

(b) Each party shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Sections

kind of Consideration to be received by Linkage as provided in this Agreement
or (B) any of the material terms of this Agreement.

circumstance relating to any party, or any of its respective Affiliates,
shareholders, officers or directors should be discovered by any party, which

that the Proxy Statement would not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such party shall
promptly inform the other parties. As promptly as practicable after
discovering such event or circumstance or being so informed, AsiaInfo, with
the reasonable cooperation and assistance of the Linkage Parties, shall
prepare and file with the SEC an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement containing a description of such event or circumstance and
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of AsiaInfo. Prior to the occurrence of any Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Key Linkage Shareholders and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such amendment or
supplement prior to filing with the SEC.

(c) AsiaInfo covenants that the information supplied by AsiaInfo for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders
of AsiaInfo and (ii) the time of the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that AsiaInfo is responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting or, the Combination-
Related Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all material
aspects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

the time of the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

4.10 _AsiaInfo Stockholders  Meeting_. AsiaInfo shall take all actions in
accordance with law, the organizational documents of AsiaInfo and the rules
of The NASDAQ Global Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold as promptly as practicable, the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting solely
for the purpose of (a) considering and voting upon the issuance of the
Consideration in the Combination, including, without limitation, the Stock
Consideration and (b) considering and voting upon the change of the name of
AsiaInfo following the completion of the Combination to "AsiaInfo-Linkage,
Inc." (the "AsiaInfo Voting Proposal"). Once the AsiaInfo Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, AsiaInfo shall not postpone or adjourn
the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Linkage, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, other than (i) for the
absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that it believes in
good faith is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental and
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by AsiaInfos stockholders
prior to the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting and for the satisfaction of the
proviso to the fourth sentence of this paragraph; _provided_ , that in the
event that the AsiaInfo Stockholders Meeting would be delayed to a date after
the End Date as a result of either (i) or (ii) above, then, the End Date
shall be extended to the fifth Business Day after such date). Except as
expressly permitted by this Section 4.10, (X) the AsiaInfo Board shall
recommend approval of the AsiaInfo Voting Proposal by the stockholders of
AsiaInfo and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (Y) none of
AsiaInfo, the AsiaInfo Board or any other committee of the AsiaInfo Board
shall withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw,
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Linkage or the Key Linkage
Shareholders, the recommendation of the AsiaInfo Board that AsiaInfos
stockholders vote in favor of the AsiaInfo Voting Proposal (any of the
foregoing, or a failure by the AsiaInfo Board to recommend approval of the
AsiaInfo Voting Proposal in the Proxy Statement, an "Adverse Recommendation
Change"), and (Z) AsiaInfo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the AsiaInfo Voting
Proposal and subject to the fiduciary duties of the directors, shall take all
reasonably necessary action to secure the vote of stockholders required by
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Required AsiaInfo Vote, the AsiaInfo Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the AsiaInfo Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that
notwithstanding an Adverse Recommendation Change, AsiaInfo shall convene and
hold the AsiaInfo Stockholder Meeting, unless the Agreement is otherwise
terminated in accordance with its terms.

_SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the right of
AsiaInfo or Linkage to indemnification or other remedies at any time will not
be affected in any way by any investigation conducted or knowledge (whether
actual, constructive or imputed) acquired at any time by such party with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with or performance of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation or by the
waiver any condition. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Linkage, the Key Linkage Shareholders and AsiaInfo contained in
this Agreement will survive the Closing (a) indefinitely with respect to
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.3, 2.4(a), 2A.1
and 2A.2, 3.2, 3.3(a) and 3.3(b), (b) until sixty (60) calendar days after the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (including all periods of
extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to matters covered
by Section 2.15 and Section 3.13, (c) until the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of all other representations and
warranties and any covenant or agreement to be performed by Linkage, the Key
Linkage Shareholders or AsiaInfo in whole or in part on or prior to the
Closing, or (d) with respect to each other covenant or agreement of Linkage,
the Key Linkage Shareholders or AsiaInfo contained in this Agreement,
following the last date on which such covenant or agreement is to be performed
or, if no such date is specified, indefinitely, except that any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would
otherwise terminate in accordance with clause (b), (c) or (d) above will
continue to survive (but solely with respect to the matters set forth in such
Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice) if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as
applicable) shall have been timely given under Section 8.3(a) on or prior to
such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.1, any Linkage Party shall be entitled to make a
claim at 



 

72  any time in respect of any breach of the representations and warranties and
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. Any such claim by a
Linkage Party shall not be subject to any of the qualifications and
limitations with respect to indemnification set forth in Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3.

8.2  _Indemnification._

(a) _Indemnification by Linkage and Key Linkage Shareholders_. From and after
the Closing Date, Linkage and the Key Linkage Shareholders (collectively, the
"Indemnifying Parties") shall, jointly and severally, indemnify AsiaInfo and
its officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (excluding any
Person who is a shareholder or former shareholder of Linkage) (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from
and against, any and all Actions, Losses (excluding special or punitive
damages unless such damages are the subject of a Third Party Claim),
diminution in value or interest (individually, an "Indemnifiable Loss" and
collectively, "Indemnifiable Losses") (it being understood that in determining
the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses, the terms "material," "materially"
and "Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded) suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting
from, arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Linkage
or any Key Linkage Shareholder in this Agreement or the certificate delivered

(ii) any breach, non-fulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Linkage contained in this Agreement or the

(iii) any payments made (whether made before or after the Closing) or any
outstanding obligations to Barclays Capital, any financial or other advisor
(including law firms), consultant or service provider retained by Linkage or
any of its Group Companies in connection with: (A) the Combination-Related

public offering (if and to the extent the Legacy Linkage Shareholders have not
satisfied the payment obligation set forth in Section 6.2(o)(B);

(iv) any claim by any Linkage shareholder or other Person claiming to own any
share capital of Linkage, in connection with a liquidation of Linkage and/or
the distribution of the Consideration as contemplated in Section 5.5, or any
claim involving the formation, establishment, dissolution or revocation of any
trust or other ownership arrangement involving Linkage or any of its Group

73 (v) any purchase price adjustment under Section 1.9;

any of its current or former employees in accordance with applicable PRC
law; 

(viii) any claim with respect to a failure, prior to the Closing Date, of

governmental approvals that were required in connection with the transfer of
any PRC state asset holding unit or other assets that were subject to laws and
regulations governing the sale of state-owned assets or to the supervision of

(xi) any claim with respect to Linkage Technology (Nanjing) Co., Ltd. not

(xii) any failure of Linkage at any time, or any failure of Linkages Group
Companies prior to the Closing Date, to pay or withhold any applicable Taxes
and/or fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the Combination-Related Transactions. 

(b) _Indemnification by Key Linkage Shareholders_. Each of the Indemnifying
Parties other than Linkage shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the
Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and
against, any and all Indemnifiable Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by
any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising
out of or relating to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of such Key Linkage Shareholder in Article 2A of this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered by such Key Linkage Shareholder pursuant to Section
6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) of this Agreement (with respect to the
representations and warranties of the Key Linkage Shareholders contained in
Article 2A or the covenants and agreements of the Key Linkage Shareholders in
this Agreement).



 

74 (c) _Limitations on Indemnity_. No amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a
result of any claim arising under Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b) in respect of a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Linkage or the Key Linkage
Shareholders unless and until the Indemnified Parties thereunder have
suffered, incurred, sustained or become subject to Indemnifiable Losses
referred to in such section in excess of US$300,000 in the aggregate (the
"Basket"), in which event the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek
indemnity from Linkage or the Key Linkage Shareholders, as applicable, for
the full amount of such Indemnifiable Losses, _provided_ , that this paragraph
(c) shall not apply to (i) a breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations of Linkage or the Key Linkage Shareholders contained in
Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.20, (ii) any Working Capital Shortfall or (iii) fraud
related to a representation or warranty contained herein, in any schedule
hereto, or in any certificate delivered by the Linkage Parties at the Closing
pursuant to Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(b) of this Agreement.

(d) _Additional Limitations on Indemnity_.

(i) To the extent Losses are recoverable by insurance, the Indemnified Parties
shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain maximum recovery
from such insurance. In computing any individual or aggregate amounts of
Losses, the amount of such Losses shall be deemed to be an amount net of any
insurance proceeds which the Indemnified Parties have a right to receive and
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable by any third
party to such Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, so long as, in all
cases, the timing, receipt or realization of insurance proceeds or recoveries
from third parties, the amount of increased costs of insurance arising from
the receipt or collection of such insurance proceeds, and the costs of
collection shall be taken into account in determining the amount of any
reduction in the indemnification claim. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party with respect to Losses for
which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or
Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Parties shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Parties in respect of Losses indemnified by the Indemnifying Parties.

(ii) The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss subject to indemnification under
this Section 8.2 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Relief inuring to the
Indemnified Parties on account of such Indemnifiable Losses and (ii) any
specific reserves set forth in any of the Linkage Financial Statements for
such Indemnifiable Losses (to the extent of such reserves). For purposes
hereof, "Tax Relief" shall mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in
the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be paid, by the recipient of such
benefit. The Indemnified Parties shall take all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses. For Tax purposes,
the Parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article 8 as
adjustments to the consideration received for the Shares.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation the maximum amount of
Indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to the provisions of 



 

75  Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(b) shall be limited to US$176 million,
which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, includes the Escrow Amount. Each
share of AsiaInfo Common Stock that is distributed from the Escrow Fund to
satisfy any Indemnifiable Losses shall be valued at US$24.07.

(iv) Except with respect to intentional misrepresentation or fraud claims and
as set forth in Section 9.5, this Article 8 constitutes the Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any and all monetary claims relating to
or arising from the matters set forth in Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b).

8.3 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 will be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnifying
Party might seek indemnity under Section 8.2 is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than AsiaInfo or
any Affiliate of AsiaInfo (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the Shareholders
Agent on behalf of any Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to
provide the Claim Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified
Party receives notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim only to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as
soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 and whether
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim.

(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.3(a),
then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by
the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the
discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the
Indemnified Party in the case of any settlement that provides for any relief
other than the payment of monetary damages or that provides for the payment of
monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will not be indemnified in
full pursuant to Section 8.2). The Indemnifying Party will have full control
of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the
Indemnifying Partys delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence
of this clause (i), file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take
any other action that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests; and _provided_ _further_ ,
that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will, at
the sole cost and 



 

76  expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnifying Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying
Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this clause (i), and except as provided in the
preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnified Party may take over the control of the defense or settlement
of a Third Party Claim at any time if (a) it irrevocably waives its right to
indemnity under Section 8.2 with respect to such Third Party Claim, (b) the
amount in controversy exceeds amounts in the Escrow Fund, (c) the Third Party
Claim involves relief other than the payment of monetary damages, (d) if a
conflict of interest arises between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, or (e) events arise (as determined by the Indemnified Party in good
faith) that impair the ability of the Indemnifying Party to fully, vigorously
and diligently defend the Third Party Claim. In such event, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to settle any such claim;
provided that with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) (d)
and (e) of this Section 8.3(a)(i) any such settlement shall be subject to the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). In the event that the Shareholders Agent has consented to any
such settlement, the Shareholders Agent shall not object to the amount of
any claim by the Indemnified Party against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with
respect to such settlement.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Third
Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.3(a), or if the Indemnifying Party gives
such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the
Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice
whatsoever within the Dispute Period, then the Indemnified Party will have
the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will
be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in a reasonable manner and in good
faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide
reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (ii), if the
Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability hereunder to the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute
is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner provided in
clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear the
costs and expenses of the Indemnified Partys defense pursuant to this clause
(ii) or of the Indemnifying Partys participation therein at the Indemnified
Partys request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse the Indemnifying
Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. The Indemnifying Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this clause (ii), and the Indemnifying Party
will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.



 

77 (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does
not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim under Section 8.3 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifiable Loss in the amount specified in the Claim Notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Section 8.2(a)
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Indemnifiable Loss to
the Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within 60 days of
receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Resolution Period"), such dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in accordance with Section 9.7.

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under Section 8.3
against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness
to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to give the
Indemnity Notice shall not impair such partys rights hereunder except to the
extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such
Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifiable Loss in the amount specified in the
Indemnity Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), as applicable, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Indemnifiable Loss to the
Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the
Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in
accordance with Section 9.8.

8.4 _Shareholders  Agent_.

(a) _Appointment of the Shareholders  Agent_. The Shareholders Agent shall
be constituted and appointed as agent for and on behalf of the Legacy Linkage
Shareholders to give and receive notices and communications related to this
Agreement, to authorize delivery to AsiaInfo of the monies from the Escrow
Fund in satisfaction of claims by AsiaInfo, to object to such deliveries, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Shareholders Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest
of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior written notice to AsiaInfo. No bond shall be required of the 



 

78  Shareholders Agent, and the Shareholders Agent shall receive no
compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Legacy
Linkage Shareholders.

(b) _No Liability_. The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Shareholders Agent, while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. The Key Linkage Shareholders shall severally indemnify and hold
the Shareholders Agent harmless against any Loss incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders Agent and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.

(c) _Access to Information_. The Shareholders Agent shall have reasonable
access to information about AsiaInfo and the reasonable assistance of
AsiaInfos officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties and
exercising his rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholders Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
AsiaInfo to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to
treat such information confidentially).

(d) _Conflict of Interest_. AsiaInfo acknowledges that the Shareholders Agent
may have a conflict of interest with respect to his duties as Shareholders
Agent, and in such regard the Shareholders Agent has informed AsiaInfo that
he will act in the best interests of the Legacy Linkage Shareholders.

8.5 _Actions of the Shareholders  Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Legacy Linkage Shareholders for whom Consideration otherwise issuable to them
is deposited in the Escrow Fund, and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon each such Legacy Linkage Shareholder. The Escrow Agent and AsiaInfo
may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders
Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every
such Legacy Linkage Shareholder. The Escrow Agent and AsiaInfo are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders Agent.

80 Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such receipt is on a day that is not a Business Day, such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given on the
next Business Day following such receipt. 

9.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile
or other electronic transmission in .PDF format and in any number of
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.3 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred
to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including, without limitation, the
Linkage Disclosure Schedule and the other exhibits and schedules hereto: (a)
together constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue
in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement
or the Closing, in accordance with its terms; and (b) are not intended to
confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies
hereunder and shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without
the written consent of the other party. For the avoidance of doubt, although
AsiaInfo may purchase the Shares through one of its Group Companies, the
obligations of AsiaInfo set forth in this Agreement shall at all times remain
obligations of AsiaInfo and may not be assigned to any Person (including any
of its Group Companies) without the written consent of Linkage (or, if
Linkages corporate existence has ceased, the Shareholders Agent).

9.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.



 

81 9.5 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable harm would occur and that there will be no adequate remedy at law
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any remedies that may be available
under Article 8 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement upon such
nonperformance or breach, each party hereto shall have the right to seek
injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach, or otherwise to
obtain specific performance, of any provision of this Agreement. For purposes
of such injunctive relief or specific performance, the parties hereto consent
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any U.S. federal or State
court located in New York County, in the State of New York, and agrees that
it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court.

9.6 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

9.7 _Arbitration_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim
arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the
breach, termination or invalidity hereof, shall be finally settled by
arbitration at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre under the rules
of UNCITRAL (the "Rules") as are in force at the date of the notice
of arbitration commencing any such arbitration, but subject to the amendments
made to the Rules by the rest of this Section 9.7. For the purpose of such
arbitration, there shall be a board of arbitration (the "Board
of Arbitration") consisting of three arbitrators, each of AsiaInfo and the
Shareholders Agent shall select one (1) member and the third member shall be
selected by mutual agreement of the other members, or if the other members
fail to reach agreement on a third member within twenty (20) days after their
selection, such third member shall thereafter be selected by the Hong Kong
International Arbitration Centre upon application made to it for such purpose.
The place of arbitration shall be in Hong Kong. All arbitration proceedings
shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrators shall decide any
such dispute or claim strictly in accordance with the governing law specified
in Section 9.6 of this Agreement. Judgment upon any arbitral award rendered
hereunder may be entered in any court, and/or application may be made to any
such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and/or an order of
enforcement, as the case may be.

(b) Each party shall cooperate in good faith to expedite (to the maximum
extent practicable) the conduct of any arbitral proceedings commenced under
this Agreement.

(c) The costs and expenses of the arbitration, including the fees of the
arbitration, including the fees of the Board of Arbitration, shall be borne
equally by each party to the dispute or claim, and each party shall pay its
own fees, disbursements and other charges of its counsel.



 

82 (d) Any award made by the Board of Arbitration shall be final and binding on
each of the parties that were parties to the dispute. The parties expressly
agree to waive the applicability of any laws and regulations that would
otherwise give the right to appeal the decisions of the Board of Arbitration
so that there shall be no appeal to any court of law from the award of the
Board of Arbitration, and a party shall not challenge or resist the
enforcement action taken by any other party in whose favor an award of the
Board of Arbitration was given.

(e) Notwithstanding this Section 9.7 or any other provision to the contrary in
this Agreement, no party shall be obligated to follow the foregoing
