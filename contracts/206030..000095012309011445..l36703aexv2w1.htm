 2.02 Closing.

 2.03 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by executing and delivering a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL. The Parties will make any and all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL, and the Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date or time as Parent and the Company mutually agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 2.04 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and prescribed by the DGCL and any other applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will succeed to all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and assets of the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

and Merger Sub, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub will become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. 

  

 2.05 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_, and as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to the requirements of  _Section 5.01_). 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein, by the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law (subject to the requirements of _Section 5.01_). 

  

 2.06 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time. 

  

 2.07 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any of the following securities: 

   

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares (which will be canceled and cease to exist with no payment or distribution being made with respect thereto), Company Restricted Shares (which will be treated in accordance with _Section 2.09(a)(2)_) and Dissenting Shares (which will be treated in accordance with _Section 2.10_), will be converted into and constitute the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $54.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof in the manner provided in _Section 2.08_. At the Effective Time, all Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.07(a)_ will no longer be outstanding and will be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor in accordance with _Section 2.08_. 

   

 (b) Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2.08 Exchange of Certificates; Payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (a) _Appointment of Disbursing Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a disbursing agent agreed upon by Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Company (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to
allow the Disbursing Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_ in exchange for outstanding Shares. Any income
from investment of such funds, which investment will be in accordance with
the instructions of Parent, will be payable solely to Parent (or its
designee). Parent shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit any
additional funds necessary to make all payments that may be required
pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_. Any such cash remaining in the possession of
the Disbursing Agent six (6) months after the Effective Time (together with
any earnings in respect thereof) will be delivered by the Disbursing Agent to
Parent (or its designee), and any holder of Certificates immediately prior to
the Effective Time who has not theretofore exchanged such Certificates
pursuant to this _Article II_ will thereafter be entitled to look
exclusively to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, and only as a
general creditor thereof, for the consideration to which such holder may be
entitled upon exchange of such Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Disbursing Agent nor any Party
will be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. After any remaining cash has been delivered by
the Disbursing Agent to Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.08(a)_, in the
event any Certificate has not been surrendered for the consideration to which
such holder may be entitled prior to the date that such Certificate, or the
consideration payable upon the surrender thereof, would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then the consideration
otherwise payable upon the surrender of such Certificate will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all Liens, rights, interests and adverse claims of any Person. The
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ in
respect of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented thereby.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the exchange procedures
described in this _Section 2.08_ will not apply to Company Restricted Shares
and the Company Restricted Share Consideration, and the Disbursing Agent will
not act as disbursing agent for the Company Restricted Shares. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As contemplated by _Section 2.08(a)_ above, promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to mail or deliver to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Disbursing Agent and will be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent reasonably specifies) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.07(a)_. Upon surrender to the Disbursing Agent of a Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and all other documents required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate will promptly be provided in exchange therefor cash in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be 

   ##### 

  

    

canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any consideration
to be delivered upon surrender of Certificates. 

   

 (c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash payment is to be made pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_ in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of such payment that (1) the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that any such Tax has been paid or is inapplicable, and (2) the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer. 

   

 (d) _Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock or Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Company. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, subject to applicable Laws in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Disbursing Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent or the Disbursing Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the consideration deliverable in respect of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_. 

   

 (f) _Return of Merger Consideration for Dissenting Shares_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited by Parent with the Disbursing Agent pursuant to _Section 2.08(a)_ in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent (or its designee) upon demand. 

   

 (g) _Cessation of Rights._ From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Surviving Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law, and Parent will be entitled to treat each Certificate that has not yet been surrendered for exchange solely as evidence of the right to receive the consideration into which the Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate has been converted pursuant to the Merger. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.09 Stock Incentives. 

   

 (a) _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares; Company Stock-Based Awards_. 

   

 (1) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option, will become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to, and then will be canceled automatically at, the Effective Time and will thereafter represent, and will be converted into, only the right to receive an amount of cash, if any (and without interest), equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to its cancellation, regardless of the vested status of such Company Stock Option (the " _Company Stock Option Consideration_ "). Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of Company Stock Options the Company Stock Option Consideration, if any, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within five (5) Business Days thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, no Company Stock Option Consideration will be payable in respect of Company Stock Options with an exercise price per share in excess of the Merger Consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all such Company Stock Options will be canceled automatically at the Effective Time without any payment therefor. 

   

 (2) Each restricted share of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") outstanding and subject to restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Restricted Share, will become fully vested and no longer subject to any restrictions immediately prior to, and then will be canceled automatically at the Effective Time and will thereafter represent, and will be converted into, only the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration (the " _Company Restricted Share Consideration_ "). Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of Company Restricted Shares the Company Restricted Share Consideration as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within five (5) Business Days thereafter. 

   

 (3) Each Company Stock-Based Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and no longer subject to any restrictions immediately prior to, and then will be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time and will thereafter represent, and will be converted into, only the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Stock-Based Award provides for 

   ##### 

  

    

payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a specified
reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration
exceeds such reference price) and (2) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock-Based Award (the " _Company Stock-Based Award Consideration_
"). Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders
of Company Stock-Based Awards the Company Stock-Based Award Consideration as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within five (5)
Business Days thereafter. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plan will terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company will be canceled. At and after the Effective Time, no Person will have any right under the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares, the Company Stock-Based Awards, the Company Stock Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, except the right to receive the amounts payable under this _Section 2.09_, if any. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or any committee administering the Company Stock Plan will adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required or appropriate to effect the provisions of this  _Section 2.09_. The Company will provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option, a Company Restricted Share or a Company Stock-Based Award describing the treatment of such Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or Company Stock-Based Award, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section 2.09_. 

   

 (d) Except to the extent permitted by _Section 4.01(b)_, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, no additional Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Stock-Based Awards or any other equity-based awards or other Rights will be granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan or otherwise by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 2.10 Appraisal Rights. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Exception Shares) and that are held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "). Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right 

   ##### 

  

    

to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.07_,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in
_Section 2.08_, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced
such Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent notice as promptly as reasonably practicable upon receipt by the Company of any demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and of withdrawals of any such demand, and any other communications delivered to the Company pursuant to or in connection with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Transactions, and the Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands (including any settlement offers). Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal and will not settle or offer to settle any such demand. 

  

 2.11 Withholdings. All amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and will be paid at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, without interest. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates, Company Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent. 

  

 2.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors will adopt a resolution and take all other necessary action consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that the disposition of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company Stock-Based Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act will be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. 

  

 2.13 Further Action. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

The Company has made available to Parent or its counsel, true, correct and complete copies of the Constituent Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended and in effect.

reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles).

or any acceleration of remedies or right of termination or cancellation under
any Law or under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Material
Contract or IP License, except for any such conflict, breach, violation,

 (a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to _Section 4.04(b)_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable prior to the Termination Date, the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, including: (1) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to the Merger to each be satisfied as promptly as practicable; and (2) the obtaining of all actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all registrations, notices and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities), in each case, that are required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority.

The Antitrust Filings shall be prepared and made in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, as applicable. Each Party will use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the applicable waiting period, if any, under all Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (whether in clause (a) or elsewhere), nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to require Parent or Guarantor to enter into any agreement, consent decree or other commitment requiring Parent, Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries to (A) divest, hold separate or otherwise limit the use of any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or Parent, Guarantor or their Subsidiaries, (B) litigate, pursue or defend any action or proceeding challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Laws, (C) other than filing fees required by the HSR Act, make any out of pocket expenditures of more than a de minimis amount or incur any obligations or liabilities, in each case, in order to comply with the provisions of this _Section 4.04_ or (D) take any other action that would, or would reasonably be expected

At the Stockholders Meeting, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all Shares then owned by them and their 

   ##### 

  

   

respective Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 4.09_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. 

   

 (c) The Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section 4.05_ will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal or any withdrawal of the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to the Company withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying its recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 4.09_, the Company, acting through the Company Board, will make the Company Board Recommendation at the Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 4.06 Proxy Statement. 

   

 (a) As soon as possible after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file, in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to all comments of and requests by the SEC with respect to such preliminary Proxy Statement and to cause a definitive Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest practicable time. The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of and will respond promptly to any (1) comments from the SEC or its staff and (2) request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. Parent and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to be involved in the drafting of and review and comment upon the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and any such correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Company Stockholders. 

   

 (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without the prior approval of Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers or the Transactions should be discovered by the Company or Parent, which such Party believes should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the 

   ##### 

  

   

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information (or the Party whose Subsidiary discovers such
information) shall promptly notify the other Party, and an appropriate
amendment, supplement or other filing, if any, incorporated by reference into
the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be filed by the Company
with the SEC upon mutual agreement of Parent and the Company and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, (1) disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, and (2) proxies in connection therewith will be resolicited, in
each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

   

 (c) The Company shall cause (1) the Proxy Statement to include all information required under applicable Law to be furnished to the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger and the Transactions and, subject to _Section 4.09_, to include the Company Board Recommendation and (2) all documents filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as to form and substance with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will not at the time (A) the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, (B) the Proxy Statement is disseminated to the Company Stockholders, or (C) of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement regarding Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub and furnished in writing by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. It is understood and agreed that all other information in the Proxy Statement will be deemed to have been furnished by the Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall supply all information regarding Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable. 

  

 4.07 Press Releases. The initial press releases issued by each Party announcing the Merger and the Transactions will be in a form that is mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Transactions or this Agreement and will not issue any such press release without the prior written consent of the other Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue any such press release as may be required by applicable Law, securities exchange or Nasdaq rules. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will cooperate to develop all public communications and make appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the Transactions as reasonably requested by the other Party. 

  

 4.08 Access; Information. 

   

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and
Parents Representatives such access during normal business hours to the
officers, employees, agents, books, records (including Tax Returns and work
papers of independent auditors) and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that such
access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. All requests for such access shall be made to such agents of
the Company as the Company may designate, who will be solely responsible for
coordinating all such requests and all access permitted hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to afford access to or disclose information
that would (1) jeopardize the attorney client privilege, provided that
the Company will nonetheless provide Parent and its Representatives with
appropriate information regarding the factual basis underlying any
circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such privileged analyses,
(2) violate any of its contractual obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company will have used reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure
without requiring the Company to pay any amount or waive any rights to obtain
such consent or (3) violate any Law. The Parties will make reasonable
appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous
sentence applies. 

   

 (b) Each Party will hold any information provided in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions confidential and any such information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, will be deemed to be "Information" under the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company will provide to Parent a copy of the opinion referenced in  _Section 3.01(u)_ promptly after the date of this Agreement solely for information purposes. 

  

 4.09 No Solicitation. 

   

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and its Subsidiaries (and its Subsidiaries Representatives) not to, directly or indirectly, (1) initiate, facilitate, solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals that constitute, or might reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (2) initiate or engage with any third party in any discussions or negotiations concerning, or furnish any information to any third party in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal (except to notify such third party of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 4.09_), or otherwise knowingly facilitate other inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that might reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (3) except as permitted pursuant to _Section 4.09(g)_ below, enter into any letter of intent, agreement, arrangement or undertaking (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by  _Section 4.09(b)_ below) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding that would require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or 

   ##### 

  

   

any of the other Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Representative,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise, will be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 4.09_ by the Company, and the Company will cause its
Representatives to comply with the terms of this _Section 4.09_. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 4.09(a)_, any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal received by the Company which did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.09_, furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that has made such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that: (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the Company Board, after consulting with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, after furnishing such information and entering into such discussions or negotiations, would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (3) the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with this _Section 4.09_ (including, at least two (2) Business Days prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, by giving Parent notice to the effect that the Company is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person); (4) prior to furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms similar to and no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided such agreement shall allow the Company to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, including _Section 4.09(c)_); and (5) the Company keeps Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any discussions or negotiations as provided herein. 

   

 (c) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt) notify Parent of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by the Company that has led to, or might reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of (or if oral, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of) any such proposal, discussion, negotiation, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the third party from which it was received. The Company will (1) keep Parent reasonably apprised of any material developments, discussions and negotiations with respect to any such proposal, discussion, negotiation, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, as well as any material modification of or amendment thereto, (2) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent with copies of all drafts and versions of agreements (including schedules and exhibits) relating thereto exchanged between the Company and such third party or their respective Representatives, and (3) promptly make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to any third party in connection therewith that has not previously been provided to Parent. The Company will give Parent prompt 

   ##### 

  

   

notice after any determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition
Proposal is, or would reasonably be likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal. 

   

 (d) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the Transactions) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information furnished to any Person in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.09_ prohibits or will be construed as prohibiting the Company or the Company Board from (1) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (2) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided however, that a Company Board Change of Recommendation (as defined below) shall be made only in accordance with  _Section 4.09(f)_ or _4.09(g)_. 

   

 (f) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 4.09(f)_ and  _Section 4.09(g)_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (2) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (3) withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Company Board Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), make a Company Board Change of Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a Company Board Change of Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Board Change of Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (A) given Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior notice (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting) advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (B) during such three (3) Business Day period, or such shorter period as may remain prior to the Stockholders Meeting, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with 

   ##### 

  

   

Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a
Company Board Change of Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event.
No Company Board Change of Recommendation will modify the previous approval
of the Company Board which caused all state takeover statutes or other state
Laws, including the Takeover Laws, to be inapplicable to the Transactions. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.09_ to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any duly constituted committee of the Company Board) may, in response to a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ and concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for the transactions contemplated by such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_, and any purported termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ shall be void and of no force or effect, unless, (1) the Company shall have complied with all the provisions of this _Section 4.09_ , including the notification provisions in this _Section 4.09(g)_, and with all applicable requirements of _Sections 7.01(g)_ and _7.03_ (including the payment of the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement prior to or concurrently with such termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and provided further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_: (A) until after the second Business Day following actual receipt by Parent of notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and attaching the most current versions of the definitive agreement, all exhibits and other attachments thereto and agreements (such as stockholder agreements) ancillary thereto to effect such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and stating that the Company Board intends to cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any termination pursuant to  _Section 7.01(g)_ taking effect, any amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal (such amended Superior Proposal, a " _Modified Superior Proposal_ ") shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new two (2) Business Day period with respect to such Modified Superior Proposal), during which two (2) Business Day period the Company will and will cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent so that Parent may propose an adjustment to this Agreement for the purpose of causing the Acquisition Proposal to no longer be a Superior Proposal, and (B) unless either (i) on or before the expiration of the two (2) Business Day period following the actual receipt by Parent of any Notice of Superior Proposal, Parent does not make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (a " _Matching Agreement_ ") in response to such Superior Proposal or (ii) following receipt of a Matching Agreement within the two (2) Business Day period, the Company Board (or any duly constituted committee thereof) concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and after taking into 

   ##### 

  

   

consideration the Matching Agreement, that the Superior Proposal to which the
Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior Proposal. 

  

 4.10 Takeover Laws and Provisions. Each of the Company and the Company Board will take all actions to cause the Transactions (a) not to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect and (b) to comply with any Takeover Provisions and will take all necessary steps within its control to make the Transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) any Takeover Provisions. If any Takeover Law or Takeover Provision becomes applicable to the Transactions, each of the Company and the Company Board will, upon the request of Parent or Merger Sub, use its best efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law or Takeover Provision on the Transactions. 

  

 4.11 Control of Operations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing contained in this Agreement will give to Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries operations. 

  

 4.12 Stockholder Litigation. The Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will not settle or offer to settle in exchange for the payment of funds any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or any of its directors or executive officers by any stockholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction (unless such payment of funds will be made under the Companys applicable Insurance Policy), without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 4.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will give prompt notice to each other of, and will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (a) the occurrence or failure to occur or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and (b) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.13_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice nor be deemed to have amended any of the disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, to have qualified the representations and warranties contained herein or to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of a representation 

   ##### 

  

 

or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such
material development. 

   

 4.14 Voting Agreement. The Company will take actions as may be necessary or appropriate to give effect to and implement the transfer restrictions and other provisions set forth in the Voting Agreement. 

  

 4.15 Release of Confidentiality and Standstill Obligations. The Company shall not release nor permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, unless the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company shall give Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior notice of such upcoming release and/or waiver and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including the identities of the parties to such confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreements; provided further, however, that the Company shall not release or permit the release from, or waive or permit the waiver of, any provision of any standstill or similar agreement the effect of which would be to permit such Person to effect a transaction without the approval of the Company Board.

Covenants and Agreements to be Performed Following the Closing

 (a) The indemnification provisions of the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation as in effect at the Effective Time will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who immediately prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the Company unless such modification shall be required by Law. 

   

 (b) Without limiting _Section 5.01(a)_, following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions before, at or after the Effective Time (including as to, or arising out of or pertaining to, the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. At and as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation to be amended as necessary to provide for the rights and protections contained in the indemnification and advancement of expense provisions set forth in the Constituent Documents of the Company in effect on the date hereof and 

   ##### 

  

   

with Parents obligations under this _Section 5.01_. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses in connection with any of the
foregoing as incurred by directors and officers to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws; provided that any Person to whom expenses
are advanced shall have provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it
is finally determined that it is not entitled to indemnification by a court
of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be purchased a directors and officers liability "tail" insurance policy that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as opposed to reimbursing the Company or such Subsidiaries) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before, at or after the Effective Time (including as to, or arising out of or pertaining to, the Transactions), which insurance will contain substantially equivalent scope and amount of coverage as provided in the directors and officers liability insurance currently provided as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Parent will not be obligated to pay a premium for such insurance policy in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate premium paid by the Company for its directors and officers insurance coverage in effect for the year that includes the date of this Agreement, which aggregate premium is set forth on _Section 5.01(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. If the aggregate premium necessary to purchase such insurance coverage exceeds two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate premium set forth on  _Section 5.01(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous "tail" policy of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance reasonably obtainable for an aggregate premium not exceeding two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate premium set forth on _Section 5.01(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, provided that Indemnified Parties may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to the insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

   

 (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  _Section 5.01(b)_, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent; provided, however, that failure to so notify Parent will not affect the obligations of Parent under _Section 5.01(b)_ unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. 

   

 (e) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (2) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each such case, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.01_. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 5.01_ will survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and legal representatives. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing Parents obligations set forth in this _Section 5.01_. 

  

 5.02 Employee Matters. 

   

 (a) From the Effective Time until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, the employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits and compensation plans (including with respect to salary and bonus, but not equity awards), programs and arrangements no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to the Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall: (1) provide, or cause to be provided, all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan) under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all periods of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent credited by the Company for purposes of a comparable plan (provided that there will be no duplication of benefits); and (2) with respect to any self-insured welfare benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, cause, and with respect to all other welfare benefit plans, use reasonable best efforts to cause, any pre-existing conditions limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent waived under the corresponding plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries medical, vision and/or dental benefit plans for Covered Employees are terminated prior to the end of a plan year, Covered Employees and their dependents who are then participating in a deductible-based medical, vision and/or dental benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be given credit for deductibles, co-payments and eligible out-of-pocket expenses incurred toward deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year preceding the termination date (or transfer date) in a comparable deductible-based medical, vision and/or dental benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the corresponding Parent benefit plan year. 

   

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with their respective terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, Covered Employees, including any benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event), in each case, as set forth on _Section 5.02(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) No provision in this _Section 5.02_ will (1) create or be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (2) constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment agreement, (3) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Guarantor, Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (4) limit the Surviving Corporations discretion and authority to interpret the respective employee benefit and compensation plans, agreements, arrangements, and programs, in accordance with their terms and applicable Law. 

   

 (e) Provided that Parent complies with its obligations pursuant to  _Sections 5.02(a)_ and _5.02(b)_ , no provision in this _Section 5.02_ will (1) prohibit Parent from adding, deleting or changing providers of benefits, changing, increasing or decreasing co-payments, deductibles or other requirements for coverage or benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-certification requirements), and/or making other changes in the administration or in the design, coverage and benefits provided to such Covered Employees, or (2) limit the right of the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any plan.

 (a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company. 

   

 (b) By either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that the provisions of this  _Section 7.01(b)_ shall not be available to any Party if such Partys material breach of this Agreement has been a principal cause of such Order. 

   

 (c) By either Parent or the Company if any Law shall have been adopted, enacted or promulgated that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited. 

   

 (d) By Parent if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company (other than _Section 4.09_), or any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in each case, such that (1) the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.03(a)_ or _6.03(b)_ would not be satisfied and (2) such breach, untruth or inaccuracy shall not have been cured or is incapable of being cured within fifteen (15) days after Parent shall have given the Company notice thereof. 

   

 (e) By either Parent or the Company if the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders shall not have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the Stockholders Meeting. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) By Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before November 30, 2009 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.01(f)_ shall not be available to any Party to the extent that such Partys failure to comply in all respects with any provision of this Agreement has resulted in the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date. 

   

 (g) By the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with  _Section 4.09_; provided that prior thereto and as a condition precedent thereof, the Company pays the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement in accordance with _Section 7.03_.

   ##### 

  

 

of the Confidentiality Agreement will each survive any such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, "willful or intentional breach" will include a
breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by a breaching party with
the knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement. 

   

 7.03 Termination Fee. 

   

 (a) If (1) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ or (2) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_, then the Company shall (A) pay to Parent $23,600,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and (B) reimburse up to an aggregate of $2,000,000 for Parents and Guarantors documented out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Transactions (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "). 

   

 (b) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_, then (1) the Company will pay to Parent the Expense Reimbursement and (2) if (A) prior to such termination there exists an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such offer or proposal has been rejected or has been withdrawn prior to the time of such termination) and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries accepts a written offer for, or otherwise enters into an agreement to consummate or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, then upon the signing of a definitive agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal, or, if no such agreement is signed, then upon consummation of any such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will pay to Parent the Termination Fee. 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_ or  _Section 7.01(j)_, then if (1) prior to such termination there exists an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such offer or proposal has been rejected or has been withdrawn prior to the time of such termination) and (2) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries accepts a written offer for, or otherwise enters into an agreement to consummate or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, then upon the signing of a definitive agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal, or, if no such agreement is signed, then upon consummation of any such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will pay to Parent the Expense Reimbursement and the Termination Fee. 

   

 (d) In the event that Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(e)_, then the Company will pay to Parent the Expense Reimbursement. 

   

 (e) The Company will make any payments required by this _Section 7.03_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. Assuming reasonable documentation has been provided therefor, all Expense Reimbursements payable pursuant to _Sections 7.03(a)_, _(b)_ or _(d)_ will be paid concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, and any Expense Reimbursement payable pursuant to  _Section 7.03(c)_ will be payable concurrently with the payment of any Termination Fee payable pursuant to such _Section 7.03(c)_, as set forth in the next sentence. All Termination Fees will be paid (1) no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination if terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_, (2) 

   ##### 

  

   

prior to or concurrently with such termination if terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_, and (3) the earlier of the date of the
Companys entry into an agreement providing for, or consummating, an
Acquisition Proposal if terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.01(d)_, _Section
7.01(f)_ or _Section 7.01(j)_. 

   

 (f) The Parties acknowledge that (1) the provisions of this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (2) the amount of, and basis for payment of, the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement are reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and (3) without those provisions, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Termination Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement, and in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.03_, the Company will pay to Parent and the Merger Sub their reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in this _Section 7.03_ at the rate announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its prime rate in effect on the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. Payment of the amounts described in this _Section 7.03_ will not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 Miscellaneous 

   

 8.01 Survival. None of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement will survive the Effective Time. This _Section 8.01_ will not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time and this  _Article VIII_ will survive the Effective Time. 

  

 8.02 Waiver; Amendment; Extension of Time. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, any provision of this Agreement may be (a) waived by the Party benefited by the provision, but only in writing (provided that no such waiver will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given), or (b) amended or modified at any time, but only by a written agreement executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except to the extent that any such amendment would violate applicable Law; provided that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made or given that requires further approval of the Company Stockholders under the DGCL unless the required approval is obtained. Except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may extend the time for performance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions of the other Parties to this Agreement, but only in a written agreement executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Party against which it is sought to be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUTSIDE THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN THIS _SECTION 8.04_ IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO ITS EXECUTION AND DELIVERY BY MAILING COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED UNITED STATES MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO ITS ADDRESS AS SPECIFIED IN OR PURSUANT TO _SECTION 8.07_. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT THE RIGHT OF A PARTY TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS ON ANY OTHER PARTY BY ANY OTHER LEGALLY AVAILABLE METHOD. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (AS DEFINED HEREIN).

Each Party further 

   ##### 

  

    

agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a

each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 

  

 8.06 Disclosure Schedule. Before entry into this Agreement, the Company delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a schedule (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either (a) in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or (b) as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in _Section 3.01_ or to one or more of the Companys covenants contained in _Article IV_. The Disclosure Schedule constitutes an integral part of this Agreement and is attached hereto as _Schedule A_ and is hereby incorporated herein. There may be included in the Disclosure Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information that are not "material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is "material" and will not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality" or any word or phrase of similar import used herein. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule.

 8.08 Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the Parties regarding the Transactions and supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements and understandings previously made or purported to be made with respect thereto, other than the Confidentiality Agreement and the Voting Agreement. Other than those set forth in the Voting Agreement, no representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied on by any Party in entering into this Agreement. Except for (i) the enforcement by the Indemnified Parties after the Effective Time of  _Section 5.01_, and (ii) Guarantor to the extent it is required to perform its obligations as set forth in _Section 8.13_, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties. 

  

 8.09 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon any such determination, the Parties will negotiate in good faith in an 

   ##### 

  

    

effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the Parties. 

  

 8.10 Assignment; Successors. No Party nor Guarantor may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights or interests, or delegate any of its duties, hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that Merger Sub may assign any of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder, in whole or from time to time in part, to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Guarantor without the consent of any other party, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.
