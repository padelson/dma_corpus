qualified and licensed to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions where
its ownership, leasing or operation of property or assets or its conduct of business
requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except where the failure to be in good standing

Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the corporate (or comparable) power and authority
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate all its

before or after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, any provision of this Agreement may be
(a)&nbsp;waived by the Party benefited by the provision, but only in writing (provided that no such
waiver will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given), or (b)&nbsp;amended or
modified at any time, but only by a written agreement executed in the same manner as this
Agreement, except to the extent that any such amendment would violate applicable Law; provided that
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made or given that
requires further approval of the Company Stockholders under the DGCL unless the required approval
is obtained. Except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may extend the time for performance of any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions of the other Parties to this Agreement, but only in a written agreement executed and
delivered by or on behalf of the Party against which it is sought to be enforced. Neither the
failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

and Merger Sub a schedule (the &#147;<I>Disclosure Schedule</I>&#148;) setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either (a)&nbsp;in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or (b)&nbsp;as an exception to one or more representations
or warranties contained in <U>Section&nbsp;3.01</U> or to one or more of the Company&#146;s covenants
contained in <U>Article&nbsp;IV</U>. The Disclosure Schedule constitutes an integral part of this
Agreement and is attached hereto as <U>Schedule&nbsp;A</U> and is hereby incorporated herein. There
may be included in the Disclosure Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information
that are not &#147;material,&#148; and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement
that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance) is &#147;material&#148; and will not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
&#147;material,&#148; &#147;materially,&#148; &#147;materiality&#148; or any word or phrase of similar import used herein.
Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedule relating to a possible breach or violation of any contract or Law will be construed as an
admission or indication that such breach or violation exists or has occurred. Any disclosures in
the Disclosure Schedule that refer to a document are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the text of such document, including all amendments, exhibits, schedules and other attachments
thereto. Any capitalized term used in the Disclosure Schedule and not otherwise defined therein
has the meaning given to such term in this Agreement. Any headings set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule are for convenience of reference only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of
any of the disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule.
