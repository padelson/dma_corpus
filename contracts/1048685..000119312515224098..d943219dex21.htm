This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of
June 15, 2015, by and among METALICO, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), TOTAL MERCHANT LIMITED, a Samoan limited company ("Parent"), and
TM MERGER SUB CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of

immediately preceding sentence) and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in Section 8.01 hereof.

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub be merged with and
into the Company, and the Company shall survive that merger on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

 

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company wish that certain debt of the Company, which
is currently outstanding in the form of the Company Pay-off Loans, be repaid
in full in cash by Parent and retired, with no further rights or obligations
of the Company remaining thereafter with respect thereto;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (a)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement; (b)
approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
and (c) recommended adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors or the equivalent governing body
of Parent and Merger Sub have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, unanimously approved this Agreement and, in the case

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the transactions

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the "Merger") at the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the Merger
effected in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware
as the surviving corporation of the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as
the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation."

 

Section 1.02 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 1:00
p.m., New York City time, as soon as practicable and, in any event, no later
than three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the
offices of KandL Gates LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, and the
actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

 

Section 1.03 Effective Time. As promptly as possible on the Closing Date, the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with the
DGCL. The Merger shall be effective as of the date and time of the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such
later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").  

Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



2 Section 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective
Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended so
as to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A annexed hereto, and, as
so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof or
as provided by applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations
set forth in Section 5.10, and (b) the by-laws of the Company shall be amended
so as to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B annexed hereto, and
as so amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable Law,
in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.10.

 

Section 1.06 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation
or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The individuals specified by Parent
in writing to the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold
office from and after the Effective Time until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.  

Section 1.07 Treatment of Company Pay-off Loans. Immediately at the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause each of the Company Pay-off Loans to be repaid in
full in cash (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all principal, interest
and any relevant premiums, penalties and all other obligations with respect
thereto), and shall take all such actions as reasonably necessary or
appropriate prior to the Effective Time so that the Company and each relevant
lender shall thereafter have no further rights or obligations with respect
thereto as of the Effective Time.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

 

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



3 (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.04, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.01(a), and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right
to receive $0.60 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

 

(c) Cancellation of shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will no longer be outstanding and all such shares of Company Common Stock will
be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.03, each
holder of a certificate formerly representing any such shares (each, a
"Certificate") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02
hereof.

 

(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 2.02 Surrender and Payment.

 

(a) Within fifteen days from the date hereof, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, in escrow with the Escrow Agent, an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the Escrow Amount, to be distributed as set forth herein and in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be
held under the sole dominion and control of the Escrow Agent until the
earlier of ( _x_ ) the delivery of confirmation from the Exchange Agent and
the Company of receipt by the Exchange Agent of the full amount of the Payment
Fund, less the Escrow Amount, from Parent in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 2.02(b) hereof, in which case the Escrow Amount shall be
automatically released by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent, ( _y_ )
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02
hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (unless
terminated prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting), termination
of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.04(b) hereof based on
the failure of Parent to pay the full amount of the Payment Fund in accordance
with Section 2.02(b) hereof, in which case the Escrow Amount shall be
automatically released by Escrow Agent to the Company, or ( _z_ ) termination
of this Agreement for any

 



4  other reason pursuant to the terms of Article VII (excepting termination by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.04(b)), in which case the Escrow Amount
shall be automatically released by the Escrow Agent to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Escrow Agent will not release such funds if the Escrow
Amount is subject to a pending claim against it made by the Company in
good faith.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates, or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Book-
Entry Shares"). On the day that is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent sufficient funds to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration
that is payable in accordance with Section 2.01(b) hereof and (ii) the full
amount due or payable with respect to the Company Pay-off Loans as
contemplated by Section 1.07 hereof (such funds constituting the "Payment
Fund"). If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to
pay the amounts to which holders of shares or lenders shall be entitled under
this Article II, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust
additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
in any event be liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose, except as otherwise agreed by the Company and
Parent before the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of
shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) for
use in such exchange.

 

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-

 



5  Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and
subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.03, each such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, each
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

 

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Entity any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

 

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

 



6 Section 2.03 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the relevant provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any stockholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights to appraisal,
such holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if such shares
had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and
jointly with the Company direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Neither Parent nor the Company shall,
except with the prior written consent of the other, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment, and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not require
the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.04 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

 

Section 2.05 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article II such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and applicable

 



7 _ _ Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding; _provided, however_ ,
that such parties may deduct such amounts only if such party shall (i) give
the Person receiving payment reasonable advance notice of the intention to
make such deduction or withholding, (ii) upon such Persons reasonable
request, explain the basis for such deduction or withholding, and (iii)
cooperate with such Person to the extent reasonably requested to obtain
reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding, if possible. __

Section 2.06 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article
II.

 

Section 2.07 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-based Compensation.

 

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the holder of a
Company Stock Option, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price under such
Company Stock Option subject to withholding for any Taxes required to be
withheld in accordance with Section 2.05.

 

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit award and other right, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits
measured by the value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of
shares of Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding, 

 



8  payable or reserved for issuance under any Company Stock Plan, other than
Company Stock Options (each, a "Company Stock Award") immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
or the holder of that Company Stock Award, immediately vested and, to the
extent applicable, exercisable. Each such Company Stock Award shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such
Company Stock Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject
to withholding for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
Section 2.05.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.07.

Section 2.08 Treatment of Series A and Series B Convertible Notes. At
the Effective Time, each Series A or Series B Convertible Note that is issued
and outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash or shares of Company
Common Stock as provided in each applicable Exchange Agreement dated as of the
date hereof between the holder of such Series A or Series B Convertible Notes
and the Company. Upon such payment each Series A or Series B Convertible Note
will no longer be outstanding and will be cancelled and cease to exist, and
each holder of a Series A or Series B Convertible Note shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive consideration in
accordance with the previous sentence.

Section 2.09 Treatment of TPG Warrant. At the Effective Time, and in
accordance with the terms of the issued and outstanding warrant to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock that is described on Section 2.09 of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the "TPG Warrant"), Parent shall cause to be paid
to the holders of the TPG Warrant the fee set forth on Section 2.09 of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Upon the Parents making of such payment, the TPG
Warrant shall be terminated and no party thereto shall have any further
rights or obligations thereunder.

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure
letter, dated the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure

existing or in good standing or to have such power or authority would not
be material. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or
other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Charter Documents. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
a true and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation (including any

Section 3.03 Board Approvals; Required Vote.

and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and, subject to, in the case of the consummation of the Merger,

Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval"), to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions

securities necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally,
general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law) and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 

(b) Board Approval. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted at a
meeting duly called and held and, as of the date hereof, not subsequently

15 Section 3.06 SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Sarbanes-
Oxley Act Compliance.

(a) SEC Filings. The Company has filed with or furnished to, as applicable,
the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated by reference) required to be filed with, or furnished to, the SEC
since January 1, 2012 (the "Company SEC Documents"). Except as set forth on
Section 3.06( _i_ ) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of their respective
filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the
date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
hereof), each of the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable
to such Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents, including
any financial statements, schedules or exhibits included or incorporated by
reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded
by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing prior to the date hereof), contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.06 _(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the
Companys Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC.

 

(b) Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company
SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their
respective dates; (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC and, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, the absence of notes thereto); and
(iii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of the Companys
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated therein, subject, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, to normal and year-end audit
adjustments as permitted by GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC.

(c) Internal Controls. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
established and maintains a system of "internal controls over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)

 



16  that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company Board and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements.

 

(d) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Companys "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and nonfinancial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board and on Section 3.06(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (i)
any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the
meaning assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) Undisclosed Liabilities. The audited balance sheet of the Company dated as
of December 31, 2014 contained in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof is hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet."
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material Liabilities,
which, if known, would be required to be reflected, reserved against or
recorded on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance
with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than Liabilities that (i) are reflected
or recorded on the Company Balance Sheet (including in the notes thereto),
(ii) were incurred since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary
course of business, (iii) are incurred pursuant to any Company Material
Contract, (iv) are incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (v) as set forth in Section 3.06(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



17 (f) Off-balance Sheet Arrangements. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Company
SEC Documents.

 

(g) Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January
1, 2013, each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect
to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has
arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is
otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules of the NYSE,

concern basis is greater than the amount of such entitys liabilities
(including disputed, contingent and unliquidated liabilities) as such value

of such entitys assets on a going concern basis is not less than the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liability on such entitys debts as
they become absolute and matured; (iii) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and other
liabilities (including disputed, contingent and unliquidated liabilities) as
they mature in the normal course of business; (iv) Parent and the Surviving

the Surviving Corporation are not engaged in business or a transaction, and
they are not about to engage in business or a transaction, for which the
property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, would

foregoing representation and warranty is made only as of immediately after the
Effective Time after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the payment of the Merger Consideration, funding of

material adverse effect on Parents and Merger Subs ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.02 Actions by Parent and Merger Sub. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in Article VII, Parent shall
take, and shall cause Merger Sub to take, all actions necessary to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to promptly consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent shall ensure that
Merger Sub duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis each of
the covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to Merger Sub under
this Agreement, and Parent, as applicable, shall be jointly and severally
liable with Merger Sub for the due and timely performance and satisfaction of
each of said covenants, obligations and liabilities.

 

Section 5.03 Other Actions. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth in Article VII, the Company and Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take,
or agree or commit to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.04 No Control of Other Partys Business. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the respective
operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the respective
operations of Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.05 Access to Information; Environmental Investigations;
Confidentiality.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth in Article VII, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable
access, at reasonable times during normal business hours and in a manner as
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or any

 



43  Subsidiary thereof, to the officers, accountants, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities and to all reasonably relevant books, records
(including, but not limited to, copies of all permits pursuant to
Environmental Laws), contracts and other assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent such other relevant information concerning the
business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request from time to time. Parent and Parents Representatives
(including nationally-recognized environmental consultants, other than any New
Jersey Licensed Site Remediation Professional), at the sole expense of Parent
and with the reasonable cooperation of the Company, shall make such
investigations of the properties, offices, and operations of the Company as
they deem necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any environmental investigations of any
properties owned or leased by the Company (including, but not limited to, any
subsurface investigation if such investigation is recommended by
a nationally-recognized environmental consultant), _provided that_ the
results of any such investigations shall not be disclosed to any Person other
than to Parent or Parents Representatives, without the prior written consent
of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene
any Law (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts
to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in
such jeopardy or contravention). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, no investigation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Representative of any of the foregoing or otherwise shall affect the Companys
representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their obligations
under that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 15, 2015, by and
between Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth therein.

 

Section 5.06 No Solicitation.

 

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making
of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover

 



44  Proposal, or subject to Section 5.06(b) and Section 5.06(e), (i) conduct or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has
made, any Takeover Proposal; (ii) (A) amend or grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any standstill
or similar provisions in its agreements to the extent necessary to permit a
person to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board, a Takeover
Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Takeover
Proposal to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as contemplated by and
subject to compliance with this Section or (B) take any action to render the
restrictions on "business combinations" with "interested stockholders"
inapplicable to any Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other Contract relating to any Takeover Proposal (each, a "Company
Acquisition Agreement") or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall authorize or knowingly permit any of its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, advisors and investment bankers (with respect
to any Person, the foregoing Persons are referred to herein as such Persons
"Representatives") to engage in the proscribed actions set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not
authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives
to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal advisors and the Company Financial Advisor) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover
Proposal did not result from a material breach of Section 5.06(a), the Company
may, subject to compliance with Section 5.06(c), (i) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives), provided that all such
information has previously been made available or provided to Parent or is

 



45  made available or provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such Person, and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the
extent that in connection with the foregoing Clauses (i) and (ii), the Company
has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company of any Takeover
Proposal, of any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
third party in connection with a Takeover Proposal. In such notice, the
Company shall identify the third party making, and a summary of the
material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal,
indication, or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any
meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to members
of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to
consider any Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Subject to Section 5.06(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, fail to make, amend, modify or materially
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) recommend a Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend
against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of
Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of
such offer, (iv) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation, or (v) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions
(any of actions in the foregoing Clauses (i-v), a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change").

 

(e) The foregoing notwithstanding, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with this Section 5.06(e), the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
(A) a Superior Proposal or (B) an Intervening Event, in the case of each of
Clause (A) and (B), if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



46 (f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.06(e) unless (i)
the Company has given Parent three (3) Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall (A) if relating to a
Superior Proposal, specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal
and shall contemporaneously provide Parent with the most current version of
any proposed agreement, or (B) in respect to an Intervening Event, describe
such Intervening Event and the reasons for the proposed Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) if the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement suggested by Parent and shall not
have determined (after consultation with its outside legal advisors and the
Company Financial Advisor) that the Superior Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes proposed by Parent were to be
given effect (it being understood that the Company shall not take any action
described in Section 5.06(e) during such three-Business-Day period, and that
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and an
additional three-Business-Day period that satisfies this Section 5.06(f)),
and (iii) if the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to an
Intervening Event, during such three-Business-Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event.

 

(g) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, if the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation
of applicable Law.

Section 5.07 Stockholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.06(e) hereof, and
subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Company shall take
all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the
Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of
such meeting, (ii) the Company Proxy Statement shall include the 

 



47  Company Board Recommendation, and (iii) the Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to (A) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other actions
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders
of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval.
The Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub. Once the
Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent
of Parent (other than (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders or
(ii) as reasonably determined by the Company, in good faith, to comply with
applicable Law). The foregoing sentence notwithstanding, if on a date
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company
may make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Stockholders Meeting; provided that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is later than the earlier of ( _x_ ) the
date that is thirty days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled and ( _y_ ) the date that is twenty Business
Days prior to the End Date.

 

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the
Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The
Company shall not file the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered by
the Company). The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve, and
each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving,
all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the
SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC
comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which shall 

 



48  have become false or misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such
correction. The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Company
Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company
Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with
copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to the Company Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event, the Company shall not be bound by the terms
of Section 5.07(a) or Section 5.07(b) such that the Company shall not be
obligated to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting or file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC.

Section 5.08 Notices of Certain Events.

 

(a) The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall notify the Company, promptly of (i) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any Legal Actions
commenced, or to such partys knowledge, threatened, against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that
are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any
event, change or effect between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a), Section 6.02(b), or Section 6.02(e)
of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Section
6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) of this Agreement (in the case of Parent and
Merger Sub), to be satisfied. In no event, subject in all respects to Section
5.08(b) hereof, shall (x) the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to
this Section 5.08 limit or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; or (y) disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty. This Section 5.08 shall not constitute a covenant
or agreement for purposes of Section 6.02(b) or Section 6.03(b).

 



49 (b) At any time, and from time to time on or prior to the Closing Date,
the Company may, in its sole discretion, supplement, amend or update the
Company Disclosure Letter if the Company becomes aware of any material matter,
event or occurrence first existing or occurring after the date hereof that
would have been required or appropriate to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter or which would otherwise be necessary to supplement, amend
or update any information set forth therein. Except to the extent that any
such supplements, updates or amendments result in, whether individually or
when taken together in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, such
supplements, updates or amendments pursuant to this Section 5.08(b) shall be
deemed to be incorporated into the Company Disclosure Letter and to be an
exception to the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable)
of the Company for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02 are satisfied.

 

Section 5.09 Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) provide the employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.09(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the "Key Employee") who will remain employed immediately
after the Effective Time with base salary, target bonus opportunities and
employee benefits to be reflected in the terms of an employment agreement to
be entered into between the Company and the Key Employee before the Effective
Time, the terms of which shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Key Employee,
each acting reasonably (the "Continuing Employee Agreement"), (ii) provide all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the Key Employee who
remain employed immediately after the Effective Time with base salary, target
bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), and employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to and no less
favorable than, the base salary, target bonus opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation), and employee benefits provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and (iii) cause
any employee benefit plan, if any, maintained by the Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries in which any employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, who remains employed immediately after the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Continuing Employees") will
participate (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") to recognize all service
of Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, for vesting and eligibility purposes. With respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), Parent shall: (A) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition or eligibility limitations for Company Continuing Employees and (B)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Company Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



50 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or any of their Affiliates shall assume sponsorship of the Company Employee
Plans set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Transferred Plans") and for a period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending one (1) year thereafter shall maintain employee benefits pursuant
to the Transferred Plans that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to,
and no less favorable than, employee benefits provided pursuant to the
Transferred Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. From and after the
Closing Date, (i) the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates, as
applicable, assumes from the Company and its Subsidiaries all of their
liabilities and obligations with respect to the Transferred Plans and all of
their liabilities and obligations with respect to the agreements relating to
the Transferred Plans set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries assigns to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or their Affiliate, as applicable, all of the Companys
and its Subsidiaries rights with respect to the Transferred Plans and all of
their rights with respect to the agreements relating to the Transferred Plans
set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates, as applicable, all material written
(including electronic) records and documentation relating to the Transferred
Plans and, until such records and documentation are delivered, shall cooperate
with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliate, as applicable, and
its agents, and the fiduciaries of the Transferred Plans to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliate,
as applicable, its agents and the fiduciaries of the Transferred Plans to
carry out their duties with respect to the Transferred Plans.

(c) This Section 5.09 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.09,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.09. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the terms set forth in this Section 5.09 shall not create any right in any
Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



51 (d) With respect to matters described in this Section 5.09, the Company will
not send any written notices or other written communication materials to
Company Employees without the prior consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 5.10 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in
Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending
or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition
of such proceeding or claim.

 

(b) For the latest of (i) six (6) years after the Effective Time, (ii) the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and (iii) final
resolution of any pending claims for which indemnification and expense
advancement are applicable, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (A) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as officers or directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (B) shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred (including
any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of this Section 5.10 by such Indemnified Party), and (C) advance
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in connection with matters for which such Indemnified
Parties may be eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.10 within
ten (10) days after receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of a
written request for such advance, subject to, in the case of Clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 5.10(b), the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid

 



52  in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 5.10; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time ( _provided that_ the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies containing materially the same coverage, amounts and key
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain, prior to the
effective date of termination or nonrenewal of the insurance maintained
by the Company as of the date hereof, "run-off" or "tail" insurance coverage
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least
the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims for "wrongful acts"
which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that
in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend a total
premium for such coverage in excess of $249,000 (the "Maximum Premium"). If
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at a total premium equal to or
less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of
directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for a
total premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of
this Section 5.10, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
5.10).

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, 

 



53  as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.10. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.11 Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

contemplated by this Agreement, no filing with the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States is necessary or required, and Parent covenants

partys reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding

temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

applicable Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede, or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, consent to
or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order

with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company in the event

shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(b),
_provided that_ the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained
at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof) or (ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to (x) Section 7.02(a)
hereof and _provided that_ the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have
been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment
or postponement thereof) or (y) Section 7.02(c) hereof and, in the case of
Clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above, (A) prior to such termination (in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(b)) or the
Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to Section
7.02(c)), a Takeover Proposal shall (1) in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(c), have been publicly disclosed and not
withdrawn or (2) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.03(b),
have been publicly disclosed or otherwise made or communicated to the Company
or the Company Board, and not withdrawn, and (B) within 12 (twelve) months
following the date of such termination of this Agreement the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, or any Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case,
whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original Takeover
Proposal made, communicated or publicly disclosed), then in any such event the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds), immediately prior to and as a condition to consummating such
transaction, the Termination Fee (it being understood for all purposes of this
Section 7.06(c), all references in the definition of Takeover Proposal to 15%
shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%" instead). If a Person
(other than Parent) makes a Takeover Proposal that has been publicly disclosed
and subsequently withdrawn prior to such termination or the Company
Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, and, within 12 (twelve) months following
the date of the termination of this Agreement, such Person or any of its
controlled Affiliates makes a Takeover Proposal that is publicly disclosed,
such initial Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to have been "not withdrawn"

64 (d) All the parties to this agreement acknowledge and hereby agree that (i)
the provisions of this Section 7.06 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such
provisions, the other parties would not have entered into this Agreement, and
(ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation, and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant
to Article VII are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.06, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent makes a claim against the Company that results in a
judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable
costs and expenses of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.06 at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal.
Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the
date such amounts were required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of
actual payment, and on the basis of a 360-day year. The parties acknowledge
and agree that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such
Expenses, provided, however, that Parent shall be responsible for all expenses
and filing fees (other than expenses of counsel to the Company) incurred or
paid in connection with filings pursuant to the request of or rule imposed by
any Governmental Entity in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 __Section 7.07 Amendment. __At any time prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by written
agreement signed by each of the parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that
following the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant self-regulatory organization would
require further approval by the Companys stockholders, Merger Subs sole
stockholder, or the holders of the Convertible Notes, as applicable, without
such approval. __

 



65 Section 7.08 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party(ies), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered under this Agreement or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law,
waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by

Section 8.08 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits to
this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event
of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Company Disclosure Letter), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 

Section 8.09 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.10
hereof (which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in such
Section) and, from and after the Effective Time, for the stockholders of the
Company with respect to Article II hereof, this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and respective
successors and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

Section 8.10 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any

 



78  party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 8.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.12 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at Law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

Section 8.13 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and
all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Any such proceeding that may
occur shall occur exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or, if and only if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to attempt to assert or assert, by way of motion or other
request for leave from the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any
other Delaware court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, that there is
an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not
otherwise an available or appropriate remedy. Any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived.

 

Section 8.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The
parties may execute more than one copy of the Agreement, each of which shall
constitute an original. This Agreement will become effective when each party
to this Agreement will have received counterparts signed by all of the other
parties. Signatures transmitted via email or facsimile in the form of a PDF
file shall be deemed to be originals for all applicable purposes.
