"), by and among MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, an Iowa corporation ("

(the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have each approved the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the " _NRS_ "), whereby
each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), other than shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Sub and the Company has (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best
interests of such corporation and its stockholders, (ii) adopted this
Agreement and the Merger and (iii) recommended that its stockholders approve
this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the NRS, at the Effective Time, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. (Las Vegas time) on a date to be agreed by Parent
and the Company, but no later than the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions) at
the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois
60603, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_." SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall file the articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles
of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the applicable provisions of
the NRS. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada or at such other date and time as is agreed between the
parties and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time (i) the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in a form mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company, and (ii) the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that references therein to the name of Sub shall be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Corporation) until thereafter amended
in accordance with the NRS and the applicable provisions of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, at the Effective Time, the members
of the board of directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

 

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive $23.75 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), and all of such Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Share represented by book-entry ("
_Book Entry Shares_ ") that formerly represented any of the Shares (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
subject to _Section 2.04_.

 



2 (ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of
their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

(a)  _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
United States-based nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to
the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days, pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ ; _provided_
that, no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _Article II_ , and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Paying Agent for payment of the Aggregate Common
Stock Consideration to holders of Shares. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent
to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of Company
Common Stock and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with
_Section 2.02(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to  _Section 2.02(b)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying

 



3  Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, in each case whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after
consultation with the Company; and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock
Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates
or such Book-Entry Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.04_), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_). 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Shares and compliance with the procedures

 



4  set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into
which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

 

SECTION 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, RSU Awards, Performance Awards,
DSU Awards and Equity Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the CompanyÂ’s
board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock
Plan (the " _Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such Company Option with respect to
which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and
(ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.04_. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Option shall be exercisable, and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to the payment of the Option Payment, if any.

(b)  _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect
to Shares, excluding any award of units to acquire Shares addressed under
_Section 2.03(c)_ below (each, an " _RSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan, shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award and in
settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of restricted stock units subject to such
RSU Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU
Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.04_).

 



5 (c) _Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the CompanyÂ’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of performance
units and performance shares with respect to Shares (each, a " _Performance
Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan, shall be vested and paid
out assuming satisfaction of the applicable performance goal(s) at 100% of the
target level (provided, that if actual measured performance, determined as of
the Effective Time, would result in the vesting and payout of a Performance
Award at a level greater than 100% of the target level, a pro rata portion,
based on the fraction of the applicable performance period that has been
completed as of the Effective Time, of the Performance Award shall be vested
and paid out at such greater level and the balance of the Performance Award
shall be vested and paid out at 100% of the target level) and cancelled and,
in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Performance Award
shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Performance Award and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of performance
units or performance shares, as the case may be, subject to such Performance
Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Performance
Award Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.04_).

(d) _Treatment of Deferred Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that immediately prior to the
Effective Time, all outstanding deferred stock units (each, a " _DSU Award_
") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan, shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled DSU Award shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such DSU Award
and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of deferred stock units subject to
such DSU Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _DSU
Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.04_).

 

(e) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, RSU
Awards, Performance Awards, DSU Awards or other rights with respect to Shares
shall be granted thereunder.

 

(f) _Parent Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Surviving Corporation cash in the amount necessary to make the payments
required under this _Section 2.03_, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make the payments required under this _Section 2.03_ as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the applicable Option Payments, RSU Payments,
Performance Award Payments and DSU Payments, if any, to the holders of Company
Options, RSU Awards, Performance Awards and DSU Awards, subject to  _Section
2.04_.

SECTION 2.04 _Withholding Rights_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in
respect of the Shares, Company Options, RSU Awards, Performance Awards and the
DSU Awards cancelled in the Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such 

 



6  payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), any regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of
Treasury (a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any other applicable state, local
or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent

applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except

2010, the Company has filed with or otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the
SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive

by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") (such documents and any
other documents filed by the Company with the SEC, as have been supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, collectively, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates or, if supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, as of the date of the most
recent supplement, modification or amendment, the Company SEC Documents (i)
did not at the time each such document was filed contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied
in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as in effect on the

the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that were not (or will not be) material in amount or effect) and
(z) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries and the results of their
operations and their cash flows as of the dates and for the periods referred
to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments
that were not (or will not be) material in amount or effect). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or effect of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in
the Company Financial Statements or the Company SEC Documents.

SECTION 3.07 _Information Supplied_. The proxy statement to be sent to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_
") will not, at the time the Proxy

 



12  Statement is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders or at the time of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement,
insofar as it relates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Sub or any of their representatives specifically for inclusion (or
incorporation by reference therein) in the Proxy Statement.

SECTION 3.08 _Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls_. The Company has
designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company (a) has
designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECÂ’s rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and (b) based on its most recent
evaluation of internal control prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to
the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the CompanyÂ’s board of
directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s
ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company
has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably designed (but without making any representation or warranty as to
the effectiveness of any such controls or procedures so designed) to ensure
that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the CompanyÂ’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications of the "principal executive officer" and the "principal
financial officer" of the Company required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act with respect to such reports. Each of the principal executive
officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or
each former principal executive officer of the Company and each former
principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company
SEC Documents and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate in all material respects as of the date hereof. Except as would not,

 



13  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there are no "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in the design or operation
of the CompanyÂ’s internal controls and procedures which could adversely affect
the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data.

 

SECTION 3.09 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated or

each of the Company Subsidiaries have conducted in all material respects their
respective businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with

Company Subsidiaries has, or is subject to, any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than

the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2012
or in the notes thereto, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012, (c) incurred under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, or (d) that otherwise
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.11 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, claim,
action or proceeding to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding orders, writs, injunctions,
judgments or decrees of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified
status or has timely filed an application for a favorable determination
letter, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype or volume submitter

Affiliates maintained, contributed to or had any obligations or liabilities
under any multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section 2.03_ or as set forth in _Section
3.12(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event) could (i) entitle any employee,
officer, director or individual consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment, (B) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right

Company or any Company Subsidiary or result in any limitation on the right of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan, or (C) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or exercisability, or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,

application, and the Company has no knowledge of any reason why any such
Company Benefit Plan is not so qualified in operation.

there has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary relating to, change in employee participation or coverage under, or
(except as required by applicable Law) increase in the benefits
(whether retroactively or prospectively) payable under, any Company Benefit
Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan
above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recently
completed fiscal year of the Company. 

SECTION 3.13 _Labor_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) except for employees represented by
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, Locals 396 and

respect to Taxes imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No
deficiency with respect to Taxes has been assessed in writing against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary which has not been fully paid, otherwise
resolved or adequately reserved in the Company Financial Statements. Since

is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the 

 



17  Company, each other party thereto and is in full force and effect, except
for such failures to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

proceedings pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written notice, demand, letter or claim, in either
case, alleging that the Company or such Company Subsidiary is in violation
of, or liable under, any Environmental Law, or challenging the validity of, or

consent decree or to the knowledge of the Company, assumed, by contract or
otherwise, any liability of any other person under any Environmental Law or is
subject to any order or judgment relating to compliance with, or remedial
action under, Environmental Laws which has not been fulfilled in all material
respects or for which the remaining obligations on the part of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary are material. To the knowledge of the Company, no
investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pursuant to Environmental Laws is pending, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated to the Company an intention to conduct any such
investigation.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice, demand or claim alleging liability on the part of the Company or any
Company as a result of a Release of Hazardous Substances and, to the knowledge
of the Company, Hazardous Substances are not present in, at, on or under any

Subsidiary.

are not, in the aggregate, in excess of 5% above the capital expenditures
provided for in the CompanyÂ’s existing capital forecast, a copy of which has
been made available to Parent, (ii) in the ordinary course of business or (ii)
emergency capital expenditures in any amount that the Company determines is
necessary in its reasonable judgment to maintain its ability to operate its
businesses in the ordinary course;

(m) settle or compromise any suit or proceeding in an amount in excess of
$10,000,000 (net of any amount covered by insurance or indemnification);

 

(n) enter into any Contract that would have been required to have been listed
in _Section 3.18(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter if it were in
effect on the date of this Agreement; or

(o) authorize or enter into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

 



26 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing has not occurred prior to the
meeting of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors in February 2014, the CompanyÂ’s
board of directors may put in place short-term and long-term incentive plans
(none of which shall include the issuance of grants or awards of equity based
compensation) in the ordinary course of business. If Closing occurs in 2014
after such plans and any awards granted pursuant thereto have been put in
place, such plans will be (i) terminated in their entirety without any
payments by, or continuing obligations of, the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
replaced by plans to be established by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.10(a)_.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

SECTION 5.02  _Agreements Concerning Parent and Sub_.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the

(b) Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance
and discharge by Sub of, and the compliance by Sub with, all of the

performance and discharge by Sub hereunder. Parent shall, immediately
following execution of this Agreement, approve this Agreement in its capacity
as sole stockholder of Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Sub.

SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation; Change of Company Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03(b)_, (i) immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
investment bankers, financial advisors and counsel (collectively, the "
_Company Representatives_ ") to, cease any solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to any
Competing Proposal and request promptly that such persons return or destroy
all confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) from the
execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to not, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any Company Representative not to, (A) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage the submission of, or any inquiries with respect to, any
Competing Proposal, (B) furnish any non-public information regarding the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person in connection with or
in response to a Competing Proposal or (C) participate in any discussions or
negotiations, furnish to any person any information, or otherwise knowingly
cooperate or knowingly assist any Person, with respect to any Competing
Proposal.

 



27 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.03(a)_,
if, at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Company obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has
received a bona fide written Competing Proposal from a person that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.03_, and (ii) the CompanyÂ’s board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
furnish information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with
respect to such Competing Proposal would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, then the
Company may, subject to compliance with this _Section 5.03_, (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such Competing Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not, will not permit
or authorize the Company Subsidiaries to and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Representatives not to, disclose any such
information to such person without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such person, (y) will notify Parent in writing
prior to furnishing such information or participating in such discussions or
negotiations, provide to Parent a copy of such Competing Proposal or, if oral,
a detailed summary of the material terms and conditions of such Competing
Proposal (including the identity of the person making the Competing Proposal)
as promptly as practicable and keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
change to such material terms or conditions as promptly as practicable and
(z) will concurrently provide to Parent any written information and any other
material information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
provided or made available to such other person (or its representatives)
that was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ or  _Section 5.03(e)_, neither
the CompanyÂ’s board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
authorize, approve or recommend any Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold, modify
or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (any
action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), a " _Change of Company
Recommendation_ ") or (iii) allow the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.03(c)_,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of the Company may make a Change of Company Recommendation, if (i)
(A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of _Section
5.03(a)_ or a material breach of the remainder of _Section 5.03_) is made to
the Company by a third person, and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn,
and (B) the CompanyÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (ii) (A) the
Company provides Parent a four (4) day prior written notice of its intention
to take such action (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), which
notice shall include the identity of the person making

 



28  such Superior Proposal and include the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by
the Company nor any public announcement required by applicable Laws that the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors is considering a Change of Company Recommendation
shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation), (B) the Company has
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least four (4) days following
receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of Recommendation (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation
and an additional two (2) day period from the date of such notice) and (C)
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent to the Company, the CompanyÂ’s board of directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be
given effect and that the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.03(e)_),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the CompanyÂ’s board of
directors from effecting a Change of Company Recommendation at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval in response to an Intervening
Event if the CompanyÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Laws; provided that, prior to effecting such Change of
Company Recommendation, (i) the Company shall have provided written notice to
Parent advising Parent that the board of directors of the Company is
contemplating making such a Change of Company Recommendation and specifying
the material facts and information constituting the basis for such
contemplated determination (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such
notice by the Company nor any public announcement required by applicable Laws
that the CompanyÂ’s board of directors is considering a Change of Company
Recommendation shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation), (ii) the
Company shall have given Parent four (4) days after delivery of such notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal)
and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (iii) the board of directors
of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after taking into account
any change to the terms of this Agreement or other proposals made by the
Parent, if any, and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect such Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the CompanyÂ’s
board of directors from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) subject to _Section
5.03(d)_ and  _5.03(e)_ , making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if the CompanyÂ’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (for
the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the

 



29  Company or the CompanyÂ’s board of directors of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a
Change of Company Recommendation).

SECTION 5.04 _Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in any event no later than forty-five (45) days after the date hereof),
the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC.
Subject to _Section 5.03_, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company
Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information concerning it and Sub
that is necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Company shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
and shall consider in good faith any comments on such document or response
reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
receipt of any comments to the Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff and
of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, is discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as
practicable notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders in
accordance with _Section 5.04(a)_ (but in any event no later than forty-five
(45) days after such clearance with the SEC or, if the SEC does not review
the Proxy Statement, forty-five days after the earliest date on which the
Company could mail the Proxy Statement pursuant to the Exchange Act), duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Company Stockholder Meeting_ "), provided that (i) the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in connection with the settlement
of litigation relating to the Merger (to which settlement Parent has provided
its consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)) in order to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement to the extent
required by applicable Law; provided that the Company will hold the Company
Stockholder

 



30  Meeting as promptly as practicable thereafter, (ii) the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if required by applicable Law,
including to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading; provided that the Company will hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable thereafter, and (iii) the
Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to a date
no more than ten (10) days after its originally noticed date only to the
extent reasonably required in order to solicit additional proxies so as to
establish a quorum or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to 
_Section 5.03_, the CompanyÂ’s board of directors shall recommend that the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders approve this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_
"), and the Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Company
Recommendation or this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement, and to take all other
action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder
Approval. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Competing
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the CompanyÂ’s board of directors
makes a Change of Company Recommendation, or upon the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01(e)_, _Section 7.01(f)_ or
_Section 7.01(g)_, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action
otherwise required pursuant to _Section 5.03_ or this _Section 5.04_, and
the Company may cancel any scheduled Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

SECTION 5.05 _Access to Information; Notice of Certain Events_. (a) From the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to: (i) provide to Parent and Sub and their
respective representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in
such a manner as not to interfere with the operation of any business
conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice
to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other
facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the
business, properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing
so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege); (B) violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or
violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is party; or (C) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law
(including the HSR Act or any other antitrust or competition Law). Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives, to hold all information provided or furnished pursuant to
this  _Section 5.05_ confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business or property sites
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub
shall, and shall cause their respective representatives accessing such
properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the CompanyÂ’s and
the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding 

 



31  anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.05_, from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their
respective affiliates shall conduct, without the prior written consent of the
Company, any environmental investigation at any Owned Real Property, Leased
Real Property or Co-Owned Property, and in no event may any environmental
investigation include any sampling or other intrusive investigation of air,
surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or in connection with any
Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property or Co-Owned Property.

(b) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any written
communication from any person that is a party to a Material Contract alleging
that the consent of such person (or another person) is required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable
Law, (i) the Company shall notify Parent of any event, change, occurrence,
development or set of circumstances or facts between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time which, to the knowledge of the Company,
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.02(a)_ or _6.02(b)_ of this Agreement not to be satisfied as of the Closing
Date and (ii) Parent shall notify the Company of any event, change,
occurrence, development or set of circumstances or facts between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time which, to the knowledge of Parent,
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.03(a)_ or _6.03(b)_ of this Agreement not to be satisfied as of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.05(b)_ shall not, and shall not be deemed to, cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
at or prior to the date of this Agreement or affect any of the closing
conditions or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available, and (B) the
failure to comply with this _Section 5.05(b)_ shall not itself cause the
condition set forth in _Section 6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.03(b)_, as
applicable, not to be satisfied.

 

SECTION 5.06 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03_, each of Parent and the Company shall (and
Parent shall cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall
(and Parent shall cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or non-actions, consents, licenses,
permits (including Environmental Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations
and orders from Governmental Entities or other persons necessary
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Company Required Governmental Approvals and Parent Required
Governmental Approvals, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, make the filings
required of them or their "ultimate parent entities" under the HSR Act, (iii)
as promptly as practicable, make all registrations and filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection
therewith, with any other Governmental Entity or other persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other
proceedings to which it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each
such lawsuit or other proceeding, (v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the 

 



32  transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until the issuance of a
final, non-appealable order with respect thereto, and (vi) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in  _Section 5.06(a)_, (i)
Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take (and to cause its
affiliates to take) promptly any and all steps or promptly make any and all
undertakings necessary to obtain the Company Required Governmental Approvals
and the Parent Required Governmental Approvals, so as to enable the parties to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable (including accepting operational restrictions or limitations
and committing to or effecting the sale, license, disposition or holding
separate of such assets or businesses as are required (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders
of the relevant Governmental Entity)) and (ii) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make, subject to the condition that the
transactions contemplated herein actually occur, any undertakings (including
undertakings to make sales or other dispositions, provided that such sales or
other dispositions are conditioned upon the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby) as are required in order to obtain the Company Required
Governmental Approvals and the Parent Required Governmental
Approvals. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.06(b)_, Parent shall not be required to, and the Company shall not, in
connection with obtaining any the Company Required Governmental Approvals and
the Parent Required Governmental Approvals, consent to or take any action of
the types described above, including accepting or entering into any
operational restriction, consent decree or hold separate order or making any
divestiture or other undertaking, in each case, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (A) have a material adverse effect
on the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the terms and
conditions of the Company Required Governmental Approvals and the Parent
Required Governmental Approvals (provided that for the purpose of determining
whether a potential adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the terms and conditions of the
Company Required Governmental Approvals and the Parent Required Governmental
Approvals would constitute a material adverse effect for the purposes of this
_Section 5.06(b)(B)_, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of
entities of the size and scale of a hypothetical company that is 100% of the
size and scale of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (each
of the effects described in clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence being
referred to herein as a " _Burdensome Effect_ "). Neither Parent nor Sub,
directly or indirectly through one or more of their respective affiliates,
shall take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any
person or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to
cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in 
_Article VI_ or the consummation of the Merger.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this  _Section
5.06_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
any material communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and of the making or commencement
of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated

 



33  by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the
Antitrust Division, the FTC, the FERC, the PUCN or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with
the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

(d) The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take (and to
cause the Company Subsidiaries to take) (which shall not include the
expenditure of funds), at ParentÂ’s sole cost and expense, such actions as
Parent shall reasonably request to obtain consents, waivers, or approvals
under Material Contracts with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that (i) the Company and each Company Subsidiary
shall not be required to incur any Indebtedness pursuant to this  _Section
5.06(d)_ and (ii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall only be
required to enter into an obligation or commitment if such obligation or
commitment is conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will be effective with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries only on or after the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.07 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and thereafter Parent and
the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except (subject to  _Section 5.03_) as may
be required by applicable Law, in connection with the exercise of the
CompanyÂ’s board of directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with, or the rules of, any applicable national
securities exchange.

SECTION 5.08 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent that the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is permitted by applicable Law to
indemnify its own directors and officers, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each current or former director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit
plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and expenses), judgments, claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on
or arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a

 



34  director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or performed
services at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing
such personÂ’s rights under this _Section 5.08_. In the event of any such
loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the
Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such
Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred (provided, however, that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by
a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b)  _Insurance_. The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation either (i)
to maintain in effect for the six-year period commencing immediately after the
Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the
end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the CompanyÂ’s
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance (the " _Existing D andO
Coverage_") covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are as of the date
hereof (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become)
covered by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less advantageous
to the intended beneficiaries thereof than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof (or such other insurance that is no less favorable than the
Existing DandO Coverage)) or (ii) to purchase a six-year extended reporting
period endorsement ("reporting tail coverage") under the Existing DandO
Coverage, provided that such reporting tail coverage shall extend the director
and officer liability coverage in force as of the date hereof from the
Effective Time with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable
to the intended beneficiaries thereof as the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance.

 

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns and/or

each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time who is neither represented by a union
or labor organization with respect to the terms and conditions of their
employment nor employed pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") at a rate that is no less
favorable than the rate of base salary, wages or commission opportunities
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity to each Company Employee that is not
less favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other
compensation and benefits (including severance benefits, paid-time off and
retirement benefits, but excluding equity compensation) to Company Employees
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation
and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving

including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the
CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ employment, severance, retention
and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
(including any change in control or severance agreement between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee) disclosed or made available
to Parent, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event) and, for the duration of the Benefit Protection Period, shall do so
without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or
modification required to comply with applicable Law or as consented to by the
parties thereto.

(c) For all purposes (including for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting) under any "employee benefit plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to
whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, including any vacation,
paid time off and severance plans, but excluding benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan, each Company EmployeeÂ’s service with or
otherwise credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated
as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition

Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after

limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
actions to (i) provide for the termination of the Company Stock Purchase Plan
as of no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) ensure that
no offering period under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be commenced on
or after the date of this Agreement, other than an offering period that is
reasonably expected to end on or before the Effective Time, (iii) if the
Effective Time shall occur prior to the end of an offering period under the
Company Stock

 



37  Purchase Plan, cause a new exercise date to be set under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan, which date shall be the end of the payroll period that is at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, (iv)
prohibit participants in the Company Stock Purchase Plan from altering their
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (or for
an offering period that commences after the date of this Agreement in

period), other than to discontinue their participation in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Purchase Plan or to decrease their level of contributions, (v)
provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant
under the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Purchase Plan
(as amended pursuant to this _Section 5.10(e)_, be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest); and (vi) ensure that no current or former employees, officers,
directors or other service providers of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, or their beneficiaries, have any right to receive any securities
of Parent or its affiliates under the Company Stock Purchase Plan.

for critical employees not covered by the CompanyÂ’s change in control policy,

treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their affiliates, (ii) give any
employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or
any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person
any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ or (iii) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any
particular employee.

the Surviving Corporation shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the
amount of any such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other similar Taxes.

SECTION 5.12 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.12_ are not available or
