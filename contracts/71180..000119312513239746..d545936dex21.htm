information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms and is accumulated
and communicated to the Company&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b)&nbsp;based on its most recent evaluation of internal control prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to the

required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
