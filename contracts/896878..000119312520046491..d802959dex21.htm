the nearest whole

 



23

Effective Time.

(b) Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)_, each Unvested Company
Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option
documents (including the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan and stock
option agreement or other document evidencing such Company Option) immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions), except that (i) each Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of the number of unvested shares
of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the ratio of Per Share
Consideration Value to the Parent Stock Price (such ratio, the " _Conversion
Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at

extinguished as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment
or consideration therefor. In addition, (i) each Company Option held by a non-

Payments of the Vested RSU Consideration to current and former employees of
the Acquired Companies shall be remitted through the payroll system of the
Surviving Company. The Per Share Closing Consideration payable to Vested RSU
Holders under this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)_ shall be paid as soon as
administratively practicable, but in no event later than four (4) Business
Days, following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect
of any Vested Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation is
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the applicable settlement date(s) for such Vested Company RSU if required in
order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.07(c)_, at the Effective Time,
each award of Unvested Company RSUs that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of
Parent RSUs (each award of Unvested Company RSUs so assumed by Parent, an "
_Assumed RSU Award_ "). Following the Effective Time, each such Assumed RSU
Award will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
set forth in the applicable Company RSU award documents, including the
applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan and agreement or other document
evidencing such Company RSU award, except that each such Assumed RSU Award
will cover a number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Unvested Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ the Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Stock. Following the Effective Time, the Parent Board of
Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof with
respect to each Assumed RSU Award.

 

(c) Each Company RSU held by a non-employee director or former non-employee
director, if any, of any Acquired Company, shall be canceled and extinguished
at the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be paid the consideration
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)_ in connection with such
cancellation and extinguishment. Each Company RSU held by a consultant or
former consultant, if any, of any Acquired Company shall be canceled and
extinguished at the Effective Time and, if such Company RSU is a Vested
Company RSU, the holder thereof shall be paid the consideration contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.07(a)_ in connection with such cancellation and
extinguishment. In no event shall the Company RSUs described in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.07(c)_ be assumed by Parent.

 

Section 2.08 Merger Consideration Adjustments.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Estimate_. No later than four (4) __ Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), certified by the Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, setting forth (i) __ an estimated
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on the Closing Date and (ii) __ the Companys good
faith estimate of (A) Closing Working Capital (such estimate, " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ "), (B) Closing Indebtedness (such estimate, "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (C) Closing Cash (such estimate, "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (D) Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
(such estimate, " _Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses_ "). The
Company shall

 



25

    

 deliver supporting calculations and documentation of such calculations, in
reasonable detail, concurrently with the delivery of such Estimated Closing
Statement. The Company shall consult with Parent and its accountants with
respect to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement and the
Estimated Closing Statement shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Securityholder Representative a statement (the "
_Parent Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Parents
proposed calculation of the Adjustment Amount (including proposed
calculations of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses), together with supporting
calculations and documentation in reasonable detail.

 

(ii) During the forty-five (45) day period commencing upon receipt by the
Securityholder Representative of the Parent Closing Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), Parent shall provide the Securityholder Representative and any
accountants or advisors retained by the Securityholder Representative with
reasonable access to the books and records of the Acquired Companies for the
purposes of (A) enabling the Securityholder Representative and its accountants
and advisors to calculate, and to review Parents calculation of, the
Adjustment Amount as reflected in the Parent Closing Statement and (B)
identifying (and contesting, if applicable) any dispute related to the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Parent Closing
Statement.

 

(iii) If the Securityholder Representative disputes the Adjustment Amount
set forth in the Parent Closing Statement, then the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver a written notice (an " _Adjustment Dispute
Notice_ ") to Parent and the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the
Review Period. The Adjustment Dispute Notice shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the principal basis for the dispute of such calculation and the
Securityholder Representatives determination of the Adjustment Amount
(including proposed calculations of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses).

(iv) If the Securityholder Representative does not deliver an Adjustment
Dispute Notice to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Parent Closing Statement shall be deemed
final and binding on Parent, the Securityholder Representative and the
Securityholders as the Adjustment Amount for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(v) If the Securityholder Representative delivers an Adjustment Dispute
Notice to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Securityholder Representative and Parent shall meet, confer and exchange any
additional relevant information reasonably requested by the other Party
regarding the computation of the Adjustment Amount for a period of twenty
(20) days following the delivery of the Adjustment Dispute Notice to Parent,
and use reasonable best efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed
Modifications_ ") any differences as to the Adjustment Amount. In the event
Parent and the Securityholder Representative so resolve any such differences,
the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Parent Closing Statement, as adjusted
by the Agreed Modifications shall be final and binding as the
Adjustment Amount for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Securityholder
Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on the calculation of
the Adjustment Amount within the twenty (20) day period following the delivery
of the Adjustment Dispute Notice to Parent, then either the Securityholder
Representative or Parent may submit the objections to PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (such firm, or any successor thereto, being referred to herein as the "
_Designated Accounting Firm_ ") after such twentieth (20th) day. In

 



26

    

 resolving any disputed item, the Designated Accounting Firm (x) shall
determine the Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with the respective
definitions thereof, (y) shall limit its review to matters still in dispute as
specifically set forth in the Adjustment Dispute Notice (and only to the
extent such matters are still in dispute) and (z) shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator. The Designated Accounting Firm shall be directed by
Parent and the Securityholder Representative to resolve the unresolved
objections as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and, in any event, within thirty (30) days of such
referral, and, upon reaching such determination, to deliver a copy of its
calculations (the " _Expert Calculations_ ") to the Securityholder
Representative, Parent and the Escrow Agent. In connection with the
resolution of any such dispute by the Designated Accounting Firm, each of
Parent, the Securityholder Representative and their respective advisors and
accountants shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Designated
Accounting Firm to provide their respective views as to any disputed issues
with respect to the calculation of the Adjustment Amount. The determination of
the Adjustment Amount made by the Designated Accounting Firm shall be final
and binding on Parent, the Securityholder Representative and the
Securityholders for all purposes of this Agreement, absent manifest error. The
Expert Calculations (A) shall reflect in detail the differences, if any,
between the calculation of the Adjustment Amount reflected in the Adjustment
Dispute Notice and the calculation of the Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Parent Closing Statement and (B) with respect to any specific discrepancy or
disagreement, shall be no greater than the higher amount calculated by Parent
or the Securityholder Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than
the lower amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholder Representative, as
the case may be. The fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm
shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Designated Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Designated Accounting Firm
at the time the determination is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted to the Designated Accounting Firm.

(vi) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)_, is a negative number, then Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall promptly issue joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Surviving
Company from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
(A) an amount in cash equal to one-half of the absolute value of
the Adjustment Amount and (B) a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the
quotient of (1) one-half of the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount,
_divided by_ (2) the Parent Stock Price. 

(vii) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
this  _Section 2.08(b)_, is a positive number, then Parent shall promptly
deposit with the Exchange Agent for disbursement to the Indemnitors in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares (A) __ an amount in cash equal
to one-half of the Adjustment Amount and (B) __ a number of shares of Parent
Stock equal to the quotient of (i) __ one-half of the Adjustment Amount,
_divided by_ (ii) the Parent Stock Price (other than any such amounts which
are payable through the Surviving Companys or Parents payroll system
pursuant to this Agreement, which Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid through payroll to Vested Optionholders and Vested RSU Holders);
_provided_ that, the amount of cash set forth in clause (A) shall not exceed
an amount equal to $250,000,000, and the number of shares set forth in clause
(B) shall not exceed an amount equal to 834,082.

 



27

    

Section 2.09 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books; Exchange of
Certificates; Escrow Fund.

(a) At the Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such shares
of Company Capital Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or Parent in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.09_, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled
and shall be exchanged as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.09_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Acquiom Financial LLC
as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purposes of exchanging the Merger
Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and _Section_ __ _
2.08_. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent to be
held in trust an amount in cash equal to the portion of the Aggregate Closing
Cash Consideration necessary to fund the cash payments to be made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.09(c)_.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than one (1)
Business Day following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions in the form of
_Exhibit_ __ _ F_ hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall
include, as applicable, an acknowledgement and agreement to be bound by the
provisions of _Article_ __ _ 10_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ of this
Agreement, for use in such exchange. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the Letter
of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably requested by the
Exchange Agent, (i) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for each share of Company Capital Stock
formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate an amount in cash and
the number of shares of Parent Stock that, in each case, such holder has the
right to receive therefor pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.04(a)_ and (ii) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall, promptly after receipt of
each properly surrendered Company Stock Certificate and duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documents
reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent (collectively, the " _Exchange
Documents_ ") (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
such receipt), (x) provide written notice to Parents transfer agent of the
same so as to permit the Parents transfer agent to cause the shares of
Parent Stock constituting the Per Share Closing Stock Consideration to be
accepted into The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") and issued in
uncertificated book-entry form to such holders account designated by such
holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such Company Stock
Certificate and (y) cause the payment of the Per Share Closing Cash
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificate to be sent as designated by such
holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such Company Stock
Certificate; _provided_ , that the Exchange Agent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered the foregoing on the Closing
Date to any holder of shares of Capital Stock that has delivered duly executed
and completed Exchange Documents to the Exchange Agent at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Company Stock Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive,
contingent upon such surrender, the Per Share Closing Consideration or Vested
RSU Consideration, as applicable. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any Merger Consideration, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and indemnification agreement (without
the requirement to deliver any bond) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

 



28

    

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to (i) the Securityholder
Representative the Securityholder Expense Fund, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Securityholder
Representative in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing,
which amount shall be held in accordance with the agreement providing
therefor between the Securityholder Representative and the Company and (ii)
SunTrust Bank (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as the escrow agent under the Escrow
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ G_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), the Escrowed Cash (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent in writing at least
two (2) Business Days prior to Closing) and the Escrowed Shares, each of
which shall be held by the Escrow Agent in the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The terms and provisions of
the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are specific
terms of the Mergers, and the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Mergers by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the Written
Consent evidencing the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall constitute
approval of the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby by such Company Stockholders, as specific
terms of the Mergers. By executing the Written Consent approving and
adopting this Agreement and approving the Mergers or a Support Agreement, as
applicable, each Company Stockholder will have irrevocably agreed to be bound
by and comply with the obligations relating to the Escrow Agreement and all of
the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including
the deposit of the Securityholder Expense Fund, the Escrowed Cash and the
Escrowed Shares.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that was deposited with the
Exchange Agent and remains undistributed to Securityholders as of the third
(3rd) anniversary of this Agreement shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and Securityholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ shall thereafter
(if Parent has made such demand) look only to Parent for satisfaction of their
claims for any Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of
Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificates without any interest thereon. None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent or
the Securityholder Representative shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for the Per Share Closing
Consideration attributable to each of such shares or for any other cash
amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

Section 2.10 Fractional Shares. The number of shares of Parent Stock into
which a Securityholders shares of Company Common Stock, Vested Company RSUs
or Vested Company Options are converted pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 2_
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no fractional
shares of Parent Stock will be issued, and if, after aggregating all shares of
Parent Stock (including fractional shares) that would be issued hereunder to
a Securityholder, such aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock includes a
fraction of a share of Parent Stock, no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued hereunder and such Securityholder shall
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) such fraction of a
share of Parent Stock _multiplied by_ (b) the Parent Stock Price.

 

Section 2.11 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II,
the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration or other amount payable or otherwise deliverable to any
Securityholder or former Securityholder or other Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Exchange
Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Corporation or the

 



29

    

 Surviving Company, as the case may be, are required to deduct or withhold
therefrom under the Code, or any Applicable Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom or to which such amounts would otherwise have been
paid, and such amount shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. If, prior to Closing, Parent determines that a deduction or
withholding is required in respect of a payment of Merger Consideration in
connection with Closing (other than (i) U.S. federal backup withholding, (ii)
withholding in respect of compensatory payments, (iii) withholding required by
reason of the Companys failure to timely deliver the FIRPTA Certificate, or
(iv) withholding with respect to interest or imputed interest), Parent will
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a reasonable opportunity for
the Company to provide forms or other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or
eliminate such deduction or withholding under Applicable Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, unless otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law after

Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

 



41

    

(b) Except where such non-compliance would not reasonably expected to

Acquired Company is, and has at all times since January 1, 2017 been,

control laws and regulations, including: the Export Administration Act, the

Without limiting the foregoing:

claims or investigations of potential violations against any Acquired Company
with respect to Export Laws, any Acquired Companys export activity, or
export-related licenses or other approvals; and

 

(ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no actions, conditions or
circumstances pertaining to any Acquired Companys export transactions that

managers, officers, employees, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
distributors, resellers, consultants, agents or other third parties acting on
behalf of any Acquired Company, has provided, attempted to provide, or
authorized the provision of anything of value (including payments,

includes employees or officials working for state-owned or controlled

behalf of any Acquired Company, has used any corporate funds to maintain any
off-the-books funds or engage in any off-the-books transactions nor has
any of the before stated parties falsified any documents material to the
operations of the Acquired Companies. Since January 1, 2015, except where it
would not be reasonably expected to result in material liability to the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, none of the Acquired Companies has made
any provisions to any person (including foreign government officials) that
would constitute an improper rebate, commercial bribe, influence payment,
extortion, kickback or other improper payment in material violation of the
FCPA, UKBA or any other applicable anticorruption law. Since January 1, 2015,
none of the Acquired Companies has conducted any internal or government-

alleged act or omission arising under or relating to any noncompliance with
any applicable anticorruption law, including the FCPA and UKBA.

 

(d) Each of the Company Products made available by any Acquired Company
since January 1, 2017 has been at all times up to and including the sale,

business. To the Knowledge of the Company, no officer or Key Employee of any
Acquired Company is subject to any Order that prohibits such officer or Key
Employee from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or practice
relating to the business of any Acquired Company.

Section 3.12 Real Property.

(a) The Acquired Companies do not own and have never owned any real
property. No Acquired Company is obligated under or a party to any option,
right of first refusal or other contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell,
assign or dispose of any real property or any portion thereof or interest
therein. Each Acquired Company has a good and valid leasehold, license or
other similarly applicable interest in each parcel of real property leased,
subleased, licensed or otherwise used or occupied by such Acquired Company
(the " _Leased_ _Real Property_ ").  _Section_ __ _ 3.12(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true, correct and complete list of each item of
Leased Real Property, including the street address of the Leased Real Property
and the name of the third-party lessor thereof.

Permitted Liens. No Acquired Company has received any written notice of a
material violation of any Real Property Lease and, since the date that is
twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company
has received any written notice of a material violation of any ordinance,
regulation or building, zoning or other similar law with respect to the Leased
Real Property. No Acquired Company has received any written notice of any
expiration of, pending expiration of, changes to, or pending changes to any
material entitlement relating to the Leased Real Property and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no condemnation, special assessment or the
like pending or threatened with respect to any of the Leased Real Property.
Each Acquired Company has the right to use and occupy the Leased Real
Property for the full term of the Real Property Lease relating thereto.

 

Section 3.13 Properties.

 

(a) Each of the Acquired Companies has good and valid title to, or in the
case of leased property and assets, has valid leasehold interests in, all
material tangible property and assets (whether real, personal or mixed) used
or leased for use by such Acquired Company in connection with the conduct of
its business. None of such property or assets is subject to any Lien, except:

(i) Liens disclosed in the Financial Statements or the Company Disclosure
Schedule; 

 



43

    

(ii) Liens for taxes not yet due or being contested in good faith (and for
which adequate accruals or reserves have been established on the Balance
Sheet);

 

(iii) mechanics, carriers, workmens, warehousemans,
repairmens, materialmens or other Liens that are not yet due and payable or

zoning, building and other similar codes or restrictions of record, in each
case that do not adversely affect in any material respect, individually or in
the aggregate the current use of the applicable Leased Real Property; or

 

(vi) Liens which do not materially detract from the value, or materially
interfere with any present or intended use, of such property or assets (
_clauses_ __ _ (_ _i_ _)_ through _(_ _vi_ _)_ of this _Section_ __ _
3.13(a)_ are, collectively, the " _Permitted Liens_ ").

 

(b) There are no developments affecting any such property or assets pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened which would reasonably be
expected to materially detract from the value, materially interfere with any
present or intended use or materially adversely affect the marketability of
any such property or assets. All leases of such real property and personal
property are in good standing and are valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms and there does not exist under any such
lease any default or any event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default.

(c) The equipment owned by each Acquired Company is in good operating
condition and repair, has been reasonably maintained consistent with
standards generally followed in the industry (giving due account to the age
and length of use of such equipment, ordinary wear and tear excepted) and is
reasonably fit and suitable for its present uses.

(d) The property and assets owned or leased by the Acquired Companies, or
which they otherwise have the right to use, constitute all of the property
and assets used or held for use in connection with the businesses of the
Acquired Companies and are adequate to conduct such business as currently
conducted.

taken to obtain, perfect or maintain in full force and effect each item of
Company IP that is Registered IP have been made or taken by the applicable
deadline and otherwise in accordance with all Applicable Laws. Since January
1, 2017, no application for, or registration with respect to, any Registered
IP set forth on, or obligated to be set forth on, _Section_ __ _ 3.14(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule has been abandoned, allowed to lapse, or, as

(d) No interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other
Proceeding of any nature is, or since January 1, 2017 has been, pending or
threatened in which the scope, validity or enforceability of any Company IP is
being or has been contested or challenged and none of the Acquired Companies
has received written notice that any Company IP is invalid or unenforceable.

exploit any Company IP anywhere in the world (excluding non-disclosure
agreements and non-exclusive licenses granted to permit third parties to
advertise, market or use Company Products, in each case entered in the
ordinary course of business). No Acquired Company has transferred ownership
of (whether a whole or partial interest), or granted any exclusive right to
use, any Company IP, or any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Rights licensed to any Acquired Company, to any Person.

(f) The Acquired Companies exclusively own all right, title, and interest
to and in the Company IP, free and clear of any Liens.

(g) No Person who has licensed Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights to any Acquired Company has ownership rights to
derivative works or improvements (excluding feedback provided by an Acquired
Company in the course of receiving services) made by any Acquired Company
related to such Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights.

(h) Each Person who is or was an employee, officer, director or contractor
of any Acquired Company and who is or was engaged by an Acquired Company or
its agent to design, create or otherwise develop any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights has signed an agreement containing an assignment
to the applicable Acquired Company of all such Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights. No current or former shareholder, officer,
director or employee of any Acquired Company has any claim, right (whether or
not currently exercisable) or interest to or in any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights used by any Acquired Company. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no employee of any Acquired Company is (i) bound by or otherwise
subject to any Contract restricting him or her from performing his or her
duties for any Acquired Company or (ii) in breach of any Contract with any
former employer or other Person, in each case, concerning Intellectual
Property, Intellectual Property Rights or confidentiality.

 

(i) Since January 1, 2017, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has

material respect. _Section_ __ _ 3.14(_ _i_ _)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list, from January 1, 2017

45

    

 or any representative of any Acquired Company regarding any actual, alleged,
or suspected infringement or misappropriation of any Company IP, and provides
a brief description of the current status of the matter referred to in such
material letter, communication or correspondence.

(j) Except as would not be expected to be material to the Acquired
Companies taken as a whole, no Acquired Company has infringed,
misappropriated, or otherwise violated, or is currently infringing,
misappropriating, or otherwise violating, any Intellectual Property Right of
any other Person, _provided_ that the foregoing representation is made to the
Knowledge of the Company solely with respect to patents or trademarks owned by
third parties. No infringement, misappropriation, or similar claim or
Proceeding is pending or threatened in writing against any Acquired Company
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, against any Person who may be entitled to
be indemnified or reimbursed by any Acquired Company with respect to such
claim or Proceeding. No Acquired Company has received any written notice
relating to any actual, alleged, or suspected infringement, misappropriation,
or violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person, including
any written notice inviting an Acquired Company to take a license under any
Intellectual Property Right.

(k) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of any of the Transactions or agreements contemplated by this
Agreement, will, with or without notice or the lapse of time, result in, or
give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare, (i) a loss of,
or Lien on, any Company IP, (ii) a breach of, termination of, or acceleration
or modification of any right or obligation under any Contract listed or
required to be listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.09(a)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _

Person or (iv) the grant, assignment or transfer to any other Person of any
license or other right or interest under, to, or in any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Right, including any such grant, assignment or
transfer by Parent or its Affiliates (excluding any such grant, assignment
or transfer of any license or other right or interest that arises from any
Contract to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party but none of the
Acquired Companies is a party).

 

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company Products (i)
contains any bug, defect or error that materially and adversely affects the
use, functionality or performance of such Company Product or any product or
system containing or used in conjunction with such Company Product and (ii)
fails to comply in any material respect with any applicable warranty or other
contractual commitment relating to the use, functionality or performance of

door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," "worm,"

performing or facilitating, any of the following functions: (i) disrupting,
disabling, harming or otherwise impeding in any manner the operation of, or

service under development by any Acquired Company has been delivered,
licensed or made available to any escrow agent or other Person who is not, as

otherwise) to deliver, license or make available the source

 



46

    

 code for any Company Product or any other material product or service under
development by any Acquired Company to any escrow agent or other Person. No
event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that, with or
without notice or lapse of time, will, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in the delivery, license or disclosure of any source code for any
Company Product or any other material product or service under development by
any Acquired Company to any other Person.

letter, if applicable), or has pending or has time remaining in which to file,
an application for such determination from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no reason any such determination letter could be
revoked, not issued or not be reissued. Each trust established in connection
with any Employee Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the exempt
status of any such trust. No events have occurred with respect to any Employee
Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against any Acquired
Company of any excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979,
4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code. With respect to each Employee Plan,
(i) no Acquired Company has engaged in and, to the Knowledge of the Company,

Company RSUs upon the consummation of the Transactions pursuant to the terms
of such Company RSUs (as set forth in an award agreement in substantially the
form provided to Parent) or (z) pursuant to an Offer Letter or the Vesting
Agreement, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will be reasonably expected to (either alone or together with any
other event, including a subsequent termination of employment or service)
entitle any current or former Service Provider to (i) any acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any equity award, compensation or benefit, (ii)
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits or (iii) any increase in any compensation or benefits payable to
such current or former Service Provider.

 

(g) Neither any Acquired Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any
current or projected Liability in respect of or has any obligation to provide
(under an Employee Plan or otherwise) post-employment or post-retirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
Service Providers, except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B
of the Code or except for the continuation of coverage through the end of the
calendar month in which termination from employment occurs.

 

(h) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by any Acquired Company relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which could
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the
level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent year
ending prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



54

association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code.

 

(j) Neither any Acquired Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains
or sponsors any Employee Plan that is a self-insured plan and that provides
medical, dental or any other similar employee benefits to employees (including
any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss policy or contract applies). The
obligations of all Employee Plans that provide health, welfare or similar
insurance are fully insured by _bona fide_ third-party insurers.

(k) All contributions, premiums and payments related to each Employee Plan
have been timely discharged and paid in full on or prior to the date of this
Agreement or, to the extent not yet due, properly reflected as a Liability on
the Balance Sheet in accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee
Plan and GAAP except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
Liability to the Acquired Companies. 

 

(l) There is no Proceeding pending against or involving or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits). No Acquired Company (with respect to
any Employee Plan), and no Employee Plan or any fiduciary thereof is the

Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental
Authority, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge

been administered at all times in compliance in all material respects with
its terms and all Applicable Laws of each jurisdiction in which such Foreign

from, such Foreign Plan required to be made in accordance with the terms of
such Foreign Plan or the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction in which such
Foreign Plan is maintained, have been timely made, (iii) there are no material
pending investigations by any Governmental Authority involving such Foreign
Plan, and no pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of such Foreign Plan), or Proceedings against such Foreign
Plan. No Foreign Plan has unfunded Liabilities that will not be offset
by insurance or that are not fully accrued on the Balance Sheet.

(n) No Acquired Company is or has ever been the "employer" or is or in the
last six years has been an "associate of" or "connected with" the "employer"
(as those words in quotation marks are used in the Pensions Act 2004 of the
United Kingdom) of any UK defined benefit pension arrangement. No employee or
former employee has transferred to an Acquired Company pursuant to the in the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 of the
United Kingdom or similar local legislation in circumstances where that
individual was previously a member of a defined benefit pension arrangement
that provided for early retirement benefits.

 

(o) Each current or former Service Provider has been properly characterized
as either an employee or independent contractor, and each Employee is
properly characterized as exempt or non-exempt, in each case, for all purposes
(including for purposes of Taxes and Employee Plans), except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to the Acquired
Companies.

(p) Each Employee Plan has been operated and administered in compliance
with, is and has been in documentary compliance with, Section 409A of the Code
to the extent applicable. No compensation has been included in the gross
income of any "service provider" (within the meaning of Section 409A of

 



55

    

 the Code) of any Acquired Company as a result of the operation of Section
409A of the Code. All Company Options, Restricted Shares and Company RSUs have
been appropriately authorized by the Company Board of Directors or an
appropriate committee thereof as of the applicable date of grant, including
approval of (with respect to Company Options) the option exercise price or the
methodology for determining the option exercise price and the substantive
award terms. All Company Options have an exercise price that has never been
and is not less than the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the
date the option was granted (within the meaning of United States
Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(vi)(B)). No Company Options, Restricted
Shares or Company RSUs have been retroactively granted, nor has the exercise
price of any Company Option been determined retroactively, in any case, in
contravention of any Applicable Law.

(q) No Acquired Company is or has at any time been a party to or bound by,
or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective
bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a labor union,
works council or similar organization. No Acquired Company has experienced
any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, picketing, lockouts or other material
labor dispute with respect to any Employees during the past three (3) years,
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, are any such strikes, slowdowns,
work stoppages, picketing, lockouts or other material labor disputes
threatened. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no labor unions or
other labor organizations representing or purporting to represent, and no
union organization campaign is in progress with respect to, any Employees
with respect to their employment with any of the Acquired Companies. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, there are no Proceedings, unfair labor
practice charges, grievances or complaints pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by or on behalf of any Employees.

 

(r) Each Acquired Company is in compliance with all Applicable Laws
regarding employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, employee safety and health, immigration status and wages and
hours, and in each case, with respect to employees (i) is not liable for any
arrears of wages, severance pay or any employment Taxes or any penalty
for failure to comply with any of the foregoing and (ii) is not liable for
any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on
behalf of any Governmental Authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
employees (in each case, other than routine payments to be made in the normal
course of business and consistent with past practice), except in each case
where such non-compliance or failure to pay would not reasonably be expected
result in material Liability to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no Key Employee is in violation in any material
respect of any material term of any employment agreement, noncompetition
agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the
right of any such employee to be employed by any Acquired Company because of
the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by
such Acquired Company or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary
information of others. The Acquired Companies maintain accurate and complete
Form I-9s with respect to each of their former and current Employees in
accordance with applicable laws concerning immigration and employment
eligibility verification obligations, except where failure to maintain such
Form I-9s would not reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to
the Acquired Companies. The Acquired Companies are not party to or otherwise
bound by any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Authority
relating to employees or employment practices.

(s) Since January 1, 2017, (i) no Acquired Company has effectuated a
"plant closing" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN Act_ ")) affecting any site of employment or
one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of its business, (ii) there has not occurred a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or facility of any
Acquired Company and (iii) no Acquired Company has been affected by any

Proceedings or internal investigations or inquiries conducted by any Acquired
Company, any of their respective Boards of Directors or any committee thereof
(or any Person at the request of any of the foregoing) concerning, or any
act or allegation of or relating to, discrimination, harassment or similar

foregoing, in each case involving any current or former director, officer, Key
Employee or employee at or above the level of Senior Vice President of any
Acquired Company in his or her capacity as such, nor has there been, to the

agrees not to, and to cause each other Acquired Company not to, release any
Persons described in the preceding sentence from any obligations under

of Parent.

 



67

each of the other Acquired Companies (and each of their respective
Representatives) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
prior to or on the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall deliver written notices to request the return or destruction of all
confidential information to all Persons (except for Parent and the
Securityholders) with such return or destroy obligations under non-disclosure
or similar agreements (except for such non-disclosure or similar agreements
that do not relate to a potential Acquisition Proposal, financing of the
Company or similar transaction).

 

(iii) During the Interim Period, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours from the receipt thereof) provide Parent
with: (i) an oral and a written description of any expression of interest,
inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for information that could reasonably be expected to be used for the
purposes of formulating any inquiry, proposal or offer regarding a possible
Acquisition Proposal, that is received by any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company from any Person (other than Parent),
including in such description the identity of the Person from which such
expression of interest, inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information
was received (the " _Other Interested Party_ ") and (ii) a copy of each
written communication and a complete summary of each other communication
transmitted on behalf of the Other Interested Party or any of the Other
Interested Partys Representatives to any Acquired Company or any
Representatives of any Acquired Company or transmitted on behalf of any
Acquired Company or any Representatives of any Acquired Company to the Other
Interested Party or any of the Other Interested Partys Representatives, in
each case as relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, during
the Interim Period, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such expression of
interest, inquiry, proposal, offer or request for information (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_,
the Company may take the actions set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 5.03(a)(iv)_
in consultation with, and the prior consent of, Parent.

 

(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, at any time prior to the Companys receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board of
Directors may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor), following the
execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating
to any of the Acquired Companies to, or afford reasonable access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information
of any of the Acquired Companies to any Person or its Representatives that
has made or delivered to the Company after the date hereof (and not withdrawn)
a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, but only if the Company Board of
Directors has first determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the actions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_ would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company will prior to or contemporaneously
make available to Parent any non-public information concerning any Acquired
Company that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was
not previously made available to Parent.

 



68

    

(c) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement. Except as provided by this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_, at
no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board of Directors
(or a committee thereof) (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (ii) cause or permit any
Acquired Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (iii)
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (any action described in
clauses (i) through (iii), a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ and that the Company Board of Directors
has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company
Board of Directors may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Superior Proposal if and only if:

 

(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with and not
materially breached its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_;

(ii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL;

 

(iii) the Company Board of Directors has complied with its obligations
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; and

(iv) (A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") to the effect that
the Company Board of Directors has (i) received a _bona fide_ unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn, (ii) concluded in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(iii) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice
will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change,
including the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal and
(B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make
a presentation to the Company Board of Directors regarding this Agreement and
any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to
make such a presentation), it being understood that (x) in the event of any
material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)(iv)_ with respect to such new written notice
and (y) the Company Board of Directors, at the end of the Notice Period (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel),
must have in good faith reaffirmed its determination that such _bona fide_
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(d) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any action taken by
any Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company, would be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, then such action will be deemed to
constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_.

 



69

    

Section 5.04 Access to Information. 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, during the Interim Period,
the Company shall and shall cause each other Acquired Company to (i) give
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the facilities,
properties, personnel, Contracts, operating and financial reports, work
papers, assets, books and records of the Acquired Companies and (ii) furnish
to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information, in each case, that is currently in existence or prepared by the
Acquired Companies in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may
reasonably request; _provided_ that no information or knowledge obtained by
Parent or its Representatives in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and
Merger Subs hereunder. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.04_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business or operations of the Acquired Companies.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 5.04_, __ an Acquired Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information to the extent that (i) any Applicable Law
requires such Acquired Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of causing a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information or (iii) access to a Contract to which any Acquired
Company is a party or otherwise bound would cause such Acquired Company to be
in breach of, or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate the
rights under, such Contract. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
that any of the Acquired Companies does not provide access or information in
reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to
Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use
reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information in a reasonable
way that would not violate the Applicable Law or Contract, or risk waiver of
such privilege, including by using reasonable best efforts to obtain the
required consent of any third party necessary to provide such disclosure or
developing a reasonable alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters.

 

Section 5.05 280G Matters. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall (a) obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to
the initiation of the stockholder approval procedure under clause (b), a
waiver, in a form reviewed and approved by Parent, from each Person who is,
with respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code) as of immediately prior to the initiation of such
Requisite Stockholder Approval procedure (each, a " _Disqualified Individual_
"), and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to
receive a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code), of such Disqualified Individuals rights to all such payments or
benefits applicable to such Disqualified Individuals (the " _Waived Parachute
Payments_ ") so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to
such Disqualified Individual shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (b) as soon as
practicable following delivery of such waivers to Parent, prepare and
distribute to its stockholders a disclosure statement providing adequate
disclosure (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) of all potential
parachute payments and benefits that may be received by the Disqualified
Individual(s) and submit to the stockholders of the Company for approval (in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent) by such number of stockholders, in
a manner that meets the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any
payments and/or benefits that Parent and the Company reasonably determine may
separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments," such that, if
approved by the requisite majority of stockholders of the Company, such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code (the foregoing actions, a " _280G Vote_ "). Prior to
the Closing, if a 280G Vote is required, the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (i) that a

 



70

    

 280G Vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the Code, and
the requisite approval of stockholders of the Company was obtained with
respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Company
stockholders vote (the " _Section 280G Approval_") or (ii) that the Section
280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to the waivers
described in clause (a) of the preceding sentence, such "parachute payments"
shall not be made or provided. The form of the waiver, the disclosure
statement, any other materials to be submitted to the Companys stockholders
in connection with the Section 280G Approval and the calculations related to
the foregoing shall be subject to advance review and approval by Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.06 Notices of Certain Events. During the Interim Period, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority (i)
delivered in connection with the Transactions or (ii) indicating that a Permit
has been revoked or is about to be revoked or that a Permit is required in any
jurisdiction in which such Permit has not been obtained, which revocation or
failure to obtain has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(c) to the Companys Knowledge, any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that would indicate a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 3.16_;

Company, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 3.14_, as the case may be, or that relates to the consummation
of the Transactions;

 

(e) any material inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ that any failure to satisfy
the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ shall not be deemed to be
a breach of a covenant under this _Section_ __ _ 5.06(e)_ unless such failure
to satisfy the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ is due to the
Companys Willful Breach; and

 

(f) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ 8_
impossible or reasonably unlikely.

No such notice given pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall be deemed
to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (x)
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company in this Agreement or (y) determining whether any condition set
forth in _Article_ __ _ 8_ has been satisfied. The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_.

jurisdiction to review, the Mergers under any applicable Antitrust Laws where
such meeting or conversation is substantially related to the Mergers and (2)
the other Party the opportunity to attend or participate in such meeting or
conversation unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, and (B) in the
event of a material meeting or substantive conversation with a Governmental
Authority other than the DOJ, the FTC, or other Governmental Authority
reviewing, or asserting jurisdiction to review, the Mergers under any
applicable Antitrust Laws where such meeting or conversation is substantially
related to the Mergers, then provide (1) notice to the other Party of such
meeting or conversation, and (2) the opportunity to attend or participate in
such meeting or conversation if mutually agreed to in good faith by Parent
and the Company and not otherwise prohibited by such Governmental Authority.
However, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs may designate any non-

"outside counsel" only and any such information will not be shared with the
Representatives of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the
non-public information. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs may
redact any valuation and related information before sharing any information
provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside
counsel" only basis.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall make all strategic and
tactical decisions, following consultation with the Company, as to the manner
in which to obtain from any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Laws, any actions or non-actions, consents,
approvals, authorizations, clearances or orders required to be obtained by
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
the consummation of the Mergers; _provided_ that Parent must consider in good
faith the views of the Company with respect to such strategy and tactical
decisions referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_.

 



75

    

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if and to the
extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Mergers pursuant to the HSR Act,
each of Parent and Merger Subs (and their respective Affiliates) will and,
solely to the extent requested by Parent, the Company and its Affiliates will
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) any other restrictions on the activities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Parent will not be required, either pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ or otherwise, to (and, without Parents prior written
consent, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives to) offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any
action(s) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, product lines, assets, permits, operations, rights, or interests
therein if taking such action(s), either alone or in combination, would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will be required, either pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ or otherwise, to (and, without Parents prior
written consent, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to) offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or
otherwise take any action(s) with respect to Parent or any of its Affiliates
or their respective businesses, product lines, assets, permits, operations,
rights, or interest therein (other than with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_) if
taking such action(s), either alone or in combination, would reasonably be
expected to (A) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived
from the Mergers by Parent or (B) have more than an immaterial impact on the
Parent Consumer Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, either pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ or otherwise, shall become subject to, or consent or
agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Authority to
sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber, or
agree to make any changes, restriction or impairment, unless such requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement, order, encumbrance, agreement, change,
restriction or impairment is binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries only
in the event that the Closing occurs.

 

(e) During the Interim Period, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and
each such Party shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to the written consent of
the other Party acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or
assets or otherwise), directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the
assets, securities, properties or interests of any business, in each case, if
such action would, or would reasonably be likely to, materially impair,
materially delay or otherwise materially impact the Parties applications in
respect of the Mergers pursuant to the HSR Act.

 

Section 6.03 Preparation of the Form S-4.

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but no later than seventy-five (75) days) following
the date of this Agreement, cause to be filed with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the offer and sale of shares of
Parent Stock in the Mergers will be registered pursuant to the Securities Act
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_").
Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (i)
to have the Form S-4 become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and (ii) to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Mergers.

 

(b) The Company and Parent will provide for inclusion or incorporation by
reference into the Form S-4 all reasonably required information relating to
Parent, Merger Subs, the Company and their respective Affiliates, and the Form
S-4 shall include all information reasonably requested by such other Party to
be included therein. Parent shall promptly notify the Company and its counsel
of any comments

 



76

    

 or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Form S-4 (or any documents incorporated by reference therein), and shall
provide the Company with copies of written correspondence between Parent and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any such comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Form S-4, and will use its reasonable best efforts to incorporate any
reasonable comments of the Company or its counsel prior to such response, and
will provide the Company with a copy of all such materials received from or
submitted to the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent in responding to any such comments from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Form S-4. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the shares of Parent Stock issuable in connection with the
Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use its reasonable best
efforts to take any other action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which Parent is not now so qualified) required to be taken
under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, any applicable foreign
or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Stock included in the
Aggregate Stock Consideration, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Capital Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

(c) The information provided by Parent and the Company specifically for
use in the Form S-4 shall not, with respect to the information provided by
such person, on the date upon which the Form S-4 is declared effective by
the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly (i) correct
any information provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Form S-4 to include any information that shall
become necessary in order to make the statements in the Form S-4, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent further
agrees to cause the Form S-4 as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be
filed with the SEC and each of the Company (and will use its reasonable best
efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments of the other Party and/or its
counsel prior to such filing and dissemination), in each case as and to the
extent required by Applicable Laws.

Section 6.04 Confidentiality; Public Announcements.

(a) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree to continue to be
bound by the Amended and Restated Mutual Nondisclosure and Nonuse Agreement
dated as of August 27, 2018, by and between Parent and the Company (as
amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(b) The Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be in the form
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall
not, and shall cause each of its Representatives and Subsidiaries (and each of
their respective Representatives) not to, directly or indirectly, issue any
press release or other public statement relating to the terms of this
Agreement or the Transactions or use the other Partys name or refer to other
Party directly or indirectly in connection with other Partys relationship
with such Party in any media interview, advertisement, news release, press
release or professional or trade publication, or in any print media, whether
or not in response to an inquiry, without the prior written approval of the
other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
to the extent required by Applicable Law, in which case such Party shall
advise the other Party of any such requirement and the Parties shall use 

 



77

    

 reasonable best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable press release or other
public statement to be issued. Notwithstanding anything herein, (i) each of
the Parties and their Affiliates may issue press releases or make public
announcements concerning the Transactions that are consistent with previous
press releases or public announcements made by Parent or the Company in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ and (ii) Parent may make public
statements, with respect to the anticipated effect of this Agreement and the
Transactions on Parents business and its financial projections, with
investors, analysts and financing sources, including on its periodic earnings
calls and in any "road show," and any public disclosure as required by the
SEC, FINRA or other Governmental Authority as Parent may reasonably determine
without prior consultation with the Company.

 

Section 6.05 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill
in all respects the obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any and all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are
at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Acquired Companies
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6)-year period,
such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
respect except as and to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six (6)-year
"tail" prepaid policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") on the existing policy of
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance (the " _D andO
Policy_"), in a form mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent,
covering claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time and covering each Indemnified Party who is covered as of the
Effective Time by the DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts
that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on the date hereof on
terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Policy.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have by contract or otherwise.

 

Section 6.06 Employee Matters.

 

(a) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Continuing
Employees participate following the Closing (each, a " _Parent Plan_ "), and
except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (other than with respect
to stock options or other equity-based awards granted following the Effective
Time) and, with respect to vacation and statutory termination notice periods,
accrual of and entitlement to benefits, service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan
that is a group health plan to

 



78

    

 waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents any
eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations (except to
the extent that such requirements or limitations applied to the Continuing
Employee prior to the Effective Time under comparable Employee Plans). Parent
agrees that either (i) Continuing Employees will be permitted to continue
participating in the Employee Plans providing medical, dental, vision,
hospital or pharmaceutical benefits to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Closing through the end of the applicable calendar year that
includes the Effective Time or (ii) Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to give Continuing Employees credit under the Parent Plan(s) providing
medical, dental, vision, hospital or pharmaceutical benefits in which such
Continuing Employees participate for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
corresponding Employee Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments,
out-of-pocket maximums and other eligible expenses as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Parent
Plan (to the extent such credit would have been given for such amounts under
the corresponding Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time).

(b) In connection with the Mergers, Parent shall establish a retention
pool in an aggregate amount of $300 million (the " _Retention Pool_ ") that
will be granted to the Key Employees and certain other Employees
(collectively, " _Eligible Participants_ ") in the form of restricted stock
units covering Parent Stock (" _Parent RSUs_ "), which Parent RSUs shall be
granted following the Effective Time in accordance with Parents regular grant
practices (and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date) and subject to such vesting and other terms and conditions as set forth
on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.06(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and other terms and conditions as are
determined by Parent. The Retention Pool shall be allocated among certain of
the Eligible Participants as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.06(b)(ii)_, and
the remainder of the Retention Pool shall be allocated to such Eligible
Participants as are selected at or prior to Closing by, in such amounts and
forms as are determined by, Parent (after good faith consultation with the
Designated Employee). For purposes of the Retention Pool, the value of any
Parent RSUs shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of
Parent Stock on Nasdaq on the grant date and rounding down to the nearest
whole share.

 

(c) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time (or, if shorter, during a Continuing Employees period of employment)
and subject to any applicable Offer Letter and the Applicable Law of the
applicable jurisdiction where such Continuing Employee is located, Parent
agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company)
to provide each Employee who continues in employment with Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) following the Effective
Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "): (i) a base salary or wage rate and
target cash incentive compensation opportunity that, in each case, is no less
favorable than the base salary or wage rate and target cash incentive
compensation opportunity in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) eligibility for grants of Parent equity
awards in accordance with the ordinary course equity grant policies and
practices of the Company consistent with past practices and (iii) defined
contribution retirement (401(k)), health and welfare benefits and other
employee benefits set forth on _S_ _ection_ __ _ 3.20(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (excluding, for clarity, defined benefit pension benefits,
retiree medical benefits, transaction or retention bonuses and equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those in
effect for the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, other than distributions of Offer Letters by
Parent to the Key Employees and the Designated Employee, the Parties shall
not (and the Parties shall ensure that none of their Affiliates) issue any
formal or informal written or verbal communication (including any electronic
communication) regarding post-Closing employee benefit plans and compensation
in connection with this Agreement (collectively, " _Employment Matters_ " and
any such communications regarding Employment Matters, " _Employment
Communications_ ") that is intended for mass distribution to Employees (i.e.,
distribution to more than five percent (5%) of the total number of Employees)
without the prior approval of the other Party (including approval via
electronic communication) (with such approval not to be 

 



79

    

 unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); it being understood that the
Acquired Companies may issue Employment Communications (whether written,
verbal or electronic) without Parents prior approval if such Employment
Communications (i) are not intended for mass distribution to Employees (i.e.,
distribution to more than five percent (5%) of the total number of Employees)
(other than as distributed pursuant to internal electronic messaging
platforms such as Slack) and (ii) are consistent with (A) the mutually agreed-
upon approach to communications between the Parties relating to Employment
Matters or (B) prior press releases, public announcements, public statements
or other public disclosures made by the Parties in compliance with this
Agreement. For clarity, the Parties agree that neither the Company nor any
other Acquired Company shall make any Employment Communications (whether
formal or informal, and whether or not intended for mass distribution to
Employees) that are inconsistent with the Parties mutually agreed-upon
approach to communications (including with respect to the substance of such
communications) with respect to Employment Matters without the prior written
approval of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) Subject to applicable Privacy Laws and other Applicable Law, during the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing
Date, the Acquired Companies shall promptly provide Parent with information
related to the Service Providers and Employee Plans that is reasonably
requested by Parent and necessary or desirable for Parent to fulfill its

cause the change of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions,

under _Section_ __ _ 5.01(b)_ shall not be considered to be contemplated by
this Agreement for this purpose) and could reasonably be expected to prevent
or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Company further agrees
not to take the actions set forth on _Schedule 6.09(a)_.

applicable) (the " _Parent Tax Certificate_ "), (ii) the Company shall
deliver to each such counsel a duly executed certificate in the form attached

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01 Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries due on or before the Closing Date, subject to  _Schedule
7.01(a)_. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to such items, except as required
by Applicable Law or as set forth on _Schedule 7.01(a)_. At least thirty (30)
days prior to filing any such Tax Return, or if the due date is within thirty
(30) days of the date hereof, as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for
Parents review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are filed or required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall provide a draft of each such income Tax Return, and
any such non-income Tax Return that shows a cash Tax liability for which the
Indemnitees may claim a right to indemnification under this Agreement in
excess of $500,000 to the Securityholder Representative for review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) no less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for timely filing
of such Tax Returns, or if the due date is within thirty (30) days of the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and Parent
shall consider and take into account in good faith any reasonable comments
provided by Securityholder Representative in writing with respect to such Tax
Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due date thereof. Any such Tax
Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, with respect to such items, except as required by Applicable Law.
Pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 10_ but without limiting any of Parents rights
under _Article_ __ _ 10_, Parent may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
an amount equal to such Taxes of the Acquired Companies for such periods (and
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent to prepare and file such Tax
Returns) to the extent that such Taxes were not previously taken into account
in determining Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or as a liability in
determining the Closing Working Capital, each as finally determined pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_,
(i) all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be allocable to, and reported on,
the Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period to
the extent actually deductible by the Company or its Subsidiaries in a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under applicable Law at
a "more likely than not" or higher level of comfort, (ii) the Parties
acknowledge that, as a result of the Mergers, the U.S. federal income tax year
of the Company is expected to end as of the Closing Date, and (iii) a timely
election shall be made under IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to treat seventy
percent (70%) of any applicable success-based fees paid by the Company
relating to the Transactions as deductible for federal income Tax purposes.

 

Section 7.02 Straddle Periods. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for
all Straddle Periods. Parent shall provide a draft of any such Tax Returns
(which draft may be a pro forma Tax Return or a redacted draft showing only
information relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Acquired Companies)
that shows a cash Tax liability for which the Indemnitees may claim a right to
indemnification under this Agreement in excess of $500,000 to the
Securityholder Representative for review no less than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for timely filing of such Tax Returns, or if the due date is
within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date, and Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by the Securityholder Representative with respect to such
Tax Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due date thereof. Pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ 10_ but without limiting any of Parents rights under
_Article_ __ _ 10_, Parent may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date to the extent that such

 



82

    

 Taxes were not previously taken into account in determining Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses or as a liability in determining the Closing Working
Capital, each as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.02(i)_, the
portion of any Tax that relates to the portion of any Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of real property, personal property
and similar ad valorem Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period _multiplied_ _by_ a fraction (i) the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and
(ii) the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period and (b) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing
Date. Tax Liabilities determined under Sections 951 and 951A of the Code shall
be determined by assuming that the taxable period of each Acquired Company
ended as of the Closing Date (such that all Tax Liabilities determined under
Sections 951 and 951A of the Code that are attributable to economic activity
occurring on or before the Closing Date will be allocable to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date).

Section 7.03 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records
and information which may be reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and
making appropriate persons available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies
relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority. The
Company shall deliver or make available to Parent and the Securityholder
Representative on the Closing Date originals or accurate copies of all such
books and records.

 

Section 7.04 Contest Provisions. If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company receives notice of a Tax
Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with
respect to which Indemnitees claim a right to indemnification under
this Agreement, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice,
Parent shall notify the Securityholder Representative of such notice;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Company to so notify the Securityholder
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under
_Article_ __ _ 10_ (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such Tax Contest). Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest; _provided_ that Parent shall
permit the Securityholder Representative reasonable participation rights (to
be exercised at the expense of the Securityholders), keep the Securityholder
Representative reasonably informed of all material developments on a timely
basis and not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the Indemnitors indemnification
obligations under this Agreement without the Securityholder Representatives
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. In the case of any conflict between this  _Section_
__ _ 7.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.07_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall
control. " _Tax Contest_ " means any audit, other administrative proceeding or
inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall not apply with respect to any Tax Contest to
the extent relating to the items set forth on _Schedule 1.01(e)_ , and any
issues in such Tax Contest related to such items may be settled by Parent in
its sole discretion.

 

Section 7.05 Post-Closing Actions. Except as required by Applicable Law,
as contemplated by _Schedule 7.05_ or with the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), neither Parent nor any of its Affiliate shall (or
shall cause or permit any Acquired Company to) (a) amend, or modify
(including by way of a carry-back of any

 



83

    

 Tax attributes) any previously filed Tax Return of the Acquired Companies
for a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, or (b) initiate any
voluntary disclosure or similar process, relating in whole or in part to any
Acquired Company, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ that
the limitations contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall not apply with
respect to any Tax Returns or Taxes to the extent relating to items set forth
on _Schedule 1.01(e)_.

 

Section 7.06 Refunds. Any Damages that the Indemnitees are entitled to
recover pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(_ _i_ _)_ (relating to Taxes), and
any Damages that the Indemnitees are entitled to recover under _Article 10_
which Damages are claimed after the date of the actual receipt or realization
of the relevant refund or credit described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_,
shall be offset by the amount of any refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) of
U.S. federal and state income Taxes (including any interest related thereto
paid by the applicable Governmental Authority and, for the avoidance of doubt,
including estimated Taxes) of or imposed on any Acquired Company for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date (to the extent such Taxes
were (a) paid by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date, (b) taken
into account as an asset or in determining the amount of Tax liabilities
included in the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ or (c) recovered from the Indemnitees under _Article 10_
(including from the Indemnity Escrow Fund)), which refunds or credits are
actually received or realized by Parent or its Affiliates after the Closing,
net of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Parent or its Affiliates
in obtaining such refund or credit and Taxes resulting from the receipt
or realization of such refund or credit; except to the extent that such
refund or credit (x) relates to any item described in _Schedule 1.01(e)_ , (y)
arises as the result of a carryback of a Tax attribute arising in a Tax period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (z) was taken into
account in determining the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_).

 

Section 7.07 Characterization of Payments. Except as otherwise required by
Applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnity payments made pursuant
to _Article_ __ _ 10_ as an adjustment of the Merger Consideration paid by
Parent pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 2_ for Tax purposes.

Section 10.01 Survival of Representations, Etc.

 

(a) (i) The Company Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties made by the Company in  _Section_ __ _ 3.19_ shall survive the

_FR Expiration Date_ ") and (ii) the representations and warranties made by
the Company in all other sections of _Article_ __ _ 3_ and in the Company
Closing Certificate shall survive the Closing and expire on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _General Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the FR Expiration Date
or General Expiration Date, as applicable, Parent properly and timely delivers
to the Securityholder Representative a written notice alleging the existence
of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of such representation or warranty and
asserting a claim for recovery under _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ based on such
alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive solely with respect to such claim and only until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved.

(b) All representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Subs
shall terminate and expire as of the Effective Time, and any Liability of
Parent or Merger Subs with respect to such representations and warranties
shall thereupon cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
be deemed to limit the acknowledgement and agreement of Parent and Merger Subs
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.17_, which shall survive the Effective Time.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that if the Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Company suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any
Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting
any of the rights of each of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company,
as applicable, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with
such inaccuracy or breach.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  _Section_ __ _
10.01(a)_, in the event of Fraud or Willful Breach by the Company of any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or the
Company Closing Certificate, such representation and warranty, solely as to
such claim for Fraud or Willful Breach hereunder, shall survive the Closing
until thirty (30) days after the date on which all statutes of limitation
applicable to such claims (as the same may be extended or waived) shall have
expired. 

(e) The Company and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnitors) have agreed that the Indemnitees rights to indemnification,
compensation and reimbursement contained in this _Article_ __ _ 10_ relating
to the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company
or the Securityholder Representative are part of the basis of the bargain
contemplated by this Agreement; and such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised
by the Indemnitees with respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited or
otherwise affected by or as a result of (and the Indemnitees shall be deemed
to have relied upon such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations
notwithstanding) any information furnished to or any knowledge on the part of
any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives (regardless of whether
obtained through any

 



91

    

 investigation by any Indemnitee or any Representative of any Indemnitee or
through disclosure by the Company or any other Person, and regardless of
whether such knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement) or by reason of the fact that an Indemnitee or any
of its Representatives knew or should have known that any representation or
warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue.

 

Section 10.02 Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitors, severally and in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares,
shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against,
and shall compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages
which are suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of
the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not
such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a
result of, or are connected with:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in (i) this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (or

materiality qualification or any similar qualification (but giving effect to
any knowledge qualification) contained or incorporated directly or indirectly
in such representation or warranty) or (ii) the Company Closing Certificate;

(b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement as if such representation and warranty had
been made on and as of the Closing Date (or with respect to representations
and warranties of the Company that address matters only as of a particular
time, any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company as of such time) (in each case, without giving effect to any Company
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualification or any similar
qualification (but giving effect to any knowledge qualification) contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in such representation or warranty);

 

(c) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company or the
Securityholder Representative set forth in this Agreement;

have been payable to such holder pursuant to _Article 2_ on account of his,
her or its Company Capital Stock and (B) any including all reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket third-party fees, costs and expenses (including
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket third-party attorneys and consultants
fees, costs and expenses) defending against or settling any Proceeding in
respect of any such exercise of dissenters rights or rights of appraisal;

(g) any claims or threatened claims by or purportedly on behalf of any
holder or former holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock or rights to
acquire Company Capital Stock in his, her or its capacity as such (including
any claims or threatened claims arising out of or in connection with the
Mergers or any of the other Transactions, and any claims or threatened claims
alleging violations of fiduciary duty by any current or former member of the
Company Board of Directors or any of the current or former officers of the
Company);

 



92

    

(h) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any claim or right asserted or held by any Person who is
or at any time was an officer or member of the board of directors or managers
(or similar body) of any Acquired Company (against the Surviving Company,
Parent, any Affiliate of Parent or against any other Person) involving a
right or entitlement to indemnification or reimbursement of expenses (under
the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) or under any indemnification agreement or similar Contract) with
respect to any act or omission on the part of such Person relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions that arose, occurred or existed at or prior to
the Effective Time in their capacity as an officer or member of the board of
directors or managers (or similar body) of any Acquired Company;

(i) (A) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and (B) any Taxes of or imposed on any Acquired Companies
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any
Applicable Law) by reason of the membership of any Acquired Company in an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group prior to
the Closing; but excluding, in the case of each of (A) and (B), (w) any Taxes
to the extent taken into account in determining Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses or as a liability in determining the Closing Working Capital, each as
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, (x) Taxes incurred on
the Closing Date but after the Closing that are as a result of transactions
effected by Parent not contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of the

_Schedule 1.01(e)_ (without regard to whether such Taxes ultimately exceed the
amounts included in Closing Indebtedness) and (z) any Transfer Taxes; and

(j) any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 10.02(j)_.

Section 10.03 Limitations.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.03(d)_, the Indemnitors shall not be
required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
of the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or the
Company Closing Certificate until such time as the total amount of all
Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all
other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies in or breaches of any
representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered
or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees as a result of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company in this Agreement or the Company Closing Certificate, or to which any
one or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject as a
result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Company in this Agreement or the Company Closing
Certificate, exceeds $25,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ ") (it
being understood that if the total amount of such Damages exceeds the
Deductible, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against
and compensated and reimbursed only for such Damages that are in excess of
the Deductible).

(b) All claims for indemnification by any Indemnitee under any clause of
_Section_ __ _ 10.02_ shall be recovered first from the Escrowed Cash and
Escrowed Shares in the Indemnity Escrow Fund before any Damages may be
recovered directly from any Indemnitor hereunder.

 

(c) The sole recourse of the Indemnitors for indemnification claims under
_Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_ shall be to and from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, regardless of whether Escrowed Cash or Escrowed
Shares are recovered, before or after recovery for indemnification claims
under  _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, by any
Indemnitees to cover indemnification claims under any other

 



93

    

 clause of _Section_ __ _ 10.02_. Accordingly, to the extent any Escrowed
Cash or Escrowed Shares are released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to any
Indemnitee with respect to claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement for which the maximum Liability of the Indemnitors is not equal
to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, such released amounts will nevertheless reduce
the amount that the Indemnitees may recover with respect to claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that are subject to the
limitation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(c)_.

 

(d) The limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 10.03(c)_ shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, in each case, to
the extent such claim arises from or is a result of any breach of a Company
Fundamental Representation or any Fraud by the Company with respect to any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or the
Company Closing Certificate.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall any Indemnitor be liable to the Indemnitees for Damages under this
_Article_ __ _ 10_ (i) in excess of such Indemnitors Pro Rata Share of such
Damages or (ii) in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration actually
received by such Indemnitor;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(e)_ shall not apply with respect to an
Indemnitor in the case of such Indemnitors own Fraud or Willful Breach of any
Ancillary Document to which such Indemnitor is a party (or any other Fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement with respect to which such Indemnitor had
actual knowledge or willingly participated in the commission of such Fraud or
Willful Breach), in which event such Indemnitor shall be liable to the
Indemnitees for the full amount of Damages resulting from, arising out of or
related to such Fraud or Willful Breach.

 

(f) The amount of any Damages that any Indemnitees may be entitled to
recover shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any third-party insurance
proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnitees from any third-party insurance
carrier (net of any increase in insurance premiums, costs of collections,
deductible, retroactive or other premium adjustment, reimbursement obligation
or other costs directly related to the insurance claim (together, " _Insurance
Costs_ ")) and (ii) the amount of any indemnity or contribution actually
recovered by any Indemnitees from any third party, net of any costs incurred
in connection with recovering any such amounts. If Indemnitees receive any
such amounts under applicable insurance policies, third-party indemnification
or contribution payments subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification
payment by the Indemnitors (including from the Indemnity Escrow Fund), then
any excess Damages amount actually collected (net of costs and expenses of
such recovery and Insurance Costs) shall offset any future Damages to which
the Indemnitees are entitled to recover pursuant to this _Article 10_.

(g) The indemnification provisions contained in this  _Article_ __ _ 10_
are the sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to all Damages (and
any other damages, claims or causes of action of any kind or nature) any
Indemnitee may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Mergers
or the Transactions (it being understood that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
10.03(g)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the Parties rights to
specific performance or other equitable remedies with respect to the
covenants referred to in this Agreement or to be performed after the Closing
or any rights or remedies (including Fraud) arising out of claims Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company may have under any Ancillary
Document, including the Letters of Transmittal delivered pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.09_); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit the rights or
remedies (including with respect to any damages, claims or causes of action
of any kind or nature) of any Indemnitee against a particular Indemnitor in
the event of Fraud by the Company with respect to any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or the Company Closing
Certificate with respect to which such Indemnitor had actual knowledge or
willingly participated in the commission of such Fraud or Willful Breach.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund any Damages which are suffered or
incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are
connected with any Fraud by the Company with respect to any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or the Company Closing
Certificate.

Section 10.04 Claims and Procedures. 

(a) If Parent determines in good faith that any Indemnitee has a _bona
fide_ claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 10_, Parent
may deliver to the Securityholder Representative a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent (any certificate delivered in accordance with the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.04(a)_, an " _Officer_ __ _s Claim Certificate_
"):

 

(i) stating that an Indemnitee has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this  _Article_ __ _ 10_;

(ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, containing a good faith non-
binding, preliminary estimate of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to
be entitled to receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnitee
claims to have so incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to
incur or suffer; and

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Parent following reasonable inquiry) the material facts known to
the Indemnitee giving rise to such claim.

 

No delay in providing such Officers Claim Certificate shall affect an
Indemnitees rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Indemnitors are actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) At the time of delivery of any Officers Claim Certificate to the
Securityholder Representative, a duplicate copy of such Officers Claim
Certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of Parent
(on behalf of itself or any other Indemnitee).

 

(c) If the Securityholder Representative in good faith objects to any claim
made by Parent in any Officers Claim Certificate, then the Securityholder
Representative shall deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Dispute Notice_ ")
to Parent during the thirty (30)-day period commencing upon receipt by
the Securityholder Representative of the Officers Claim Certificate. The
Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal basis
for the dispute of any claim made by Parent in the Officers Claim
Certificate. If the Securityholder Representative does not deliver a Claim
Dispute Notice to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day
period, then (i) each claim for indemnification set forth in such Officers
Claim Certificate shall be deemed to have been conclusively determined in
Parents favor for purposes of this _Article_ __ _ 10_ on the terms set forth
in the Officers Claim Certificate and (ii) if any Escrowed Cash or Escrowed
Shares remains in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, then Parent may direct the Escrow
Agent to deliver such Escrowed Cash and/or Escrowed Shares from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 10.04_.

(d) If the Securityholder Representative delivers a Claim Dispute
Notice, then Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such objections raised by the Securityholder
Representative in such Claim Dispute Notice. If Parent and the Securityholder
Representative agree to a resolution of such objection, then a memorandum
setting forth the matters conclusively determined by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall be prepared and signed by both Parties
and, if any Escrowed Cash or Escrowed Shares remains in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, if applicable, promptly delivered to the Escrow Agent directing the
Escrow Agent to distribute such Escrowed Cash and/or Escrowed Shares from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.

 



95

    

(e) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45)-day
period following Parents receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon
the expiration of such forty-five (45)-day period, either Parent or
the Securityholder Representative may bring suit to resolve the objection in
accordance with _Sections_ __ _ 11.07_, _11.08_ and _11.09_. The decision of
the trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers
Claim Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon Parent,
the Securityholder Representative and the Company Stockholders, and Parent and
the Securityholder Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent
to act in accordance with such decision and distribute Escrowed Cash and/or
Escrowed Shares from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. 

(f) The amount of any Damages that Indemnitees may be entitled to recover
under Section _10.02(i)_ shall be subject to set-off as and to the extent
described in _Section_ __ _ 7.06_.

 

Section 10.05 Release Procedures.

 

(a) Neither the Escrowed Shares nor the Escrowed Cash (in each case,
including any portion thereof) nor any beneficial interest therein may be
pledged, subjected to any Lien, sold, assigned or transferred by any
Indemnitor, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of any Indemnitor, in each case
prior to the distribution of the Escrowed Shares or the Escrowed Cash to any
Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_.

 

(b) Parent shall be entitled to permanently retain from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in respect of finally determined Damages for which the
Indemnitees are entitled to recover pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 10_, (i)
a number of Escrowed Shares equal to the quotient of (A) one-half of the
aggregate amount of such Damages, _divided by_ (B) the Parent Stock Price and
(ii) an amount in cash equal to one-half of the aggregate amount of such
Damages. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the Parent Stock Price only
reflects an agreed-upon amount as to the value of Parent Stock solely for the
limited purpose of satisfying any Damages under this _Article_ __ _ 10_ and
is not intended to be, nor is it, deemed to constitute the fair market value
of Parent Stock at any given time.

(c) Promptly after the General Expiration Date, Parent will notify the
Securityholder Representative in writing of the amount, if any, that Parent
determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that have been asserted,
but not resolved on or prior to 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the General
Expiration Date (each such claim a " _Continuing Claim_ " and such amount, the
" _Retained Escrow Amount_ "). Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.05(e)_, within
five (5) Business Days following the General Expiration Date, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent _(_ or through the Surviving
Companys or Parents payroll system, as applicable) for distribution to the
Indemnitors an amount in the aggregate equal to (i) the amount held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund as of the General Expiration Date (as reduced from time
to time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) _minus_ (ii) the Retained
Escrow Amount, with each Indemnitor to receive a portion thereof equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the amount to be so released by (B) such
Indemnitors Pro Rata Share.

 

(d) Following the General Expiration Date, after resolution and payment of
a Continuing Claim, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.05(e)_, execute and deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Indemnity 

 



96

    

 Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent (or through the Surviving Companys or
Parents payroll system, as applicable) for distribution to the Indemnitors an
amount in the aggregate equal to (i) the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund as of the date of such resolution and payment _minus_ (ii) the amounts
that Parent determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy any other
Continuing Claims (which amounts will continue to be held in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund), with each Indemnitor to receive a portion thereof equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the amount to be so released by (B) such
Indemnitors Pro Rata Share.

 

(e) With respect to any amount to be released from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the Exchange Agent _(_ or through the Surviving Companys or Parents
payroll system, as applicable) for distribution to the Indemnitors pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ or the Escrow Agreement:

 

(i) if any former holder of Company Capital Stock is required to, but has
not executed and delivered (x) a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and
(y) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of Company Stock
Certificates or shares of uncertificated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.09_ (collectively, the " _Payment Conditions_ ") prior to the delivery to
the Escrow Agent of the applicable joint written instructions, then any amount
that would otherwise be released to such Indemnitor shall be held by the
Exchange Agent, without interest, until such holder satisfies all of such
Indemnitors applicable Payment Conditions;

 

(ii) amounts to be released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to be
distributed to each Indemnitor shall be deemed to be the product of (A) the
aggregate amount to be released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the
Indemnitors _multiplied by_ (B) each Indemnitors Pro Rata Share;

 

(iii) each distribution to be made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to a
particular Indemnitor shall be effected in accordance with the payment
delivery instructions set forth in such Indemnitors Letter of Transmittal (or
through the Surviving Companys or Parents payroll system, as applicable),
with respect to amounts to be distributed in respect of such Indemnitors
outstanding Company Capital Stock;

(iv) with respect to any amount to be released from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the Indemnitors, such amount shall be comprised of (A) Escrowed Shares
with a value (valued at the Parent Stock Price) equal to fifty percent (50%)
of such amount (with all Escrowed Shares released to any Indemnitor to be
rounded down to the nearest whole share), which shall be accepted into DTC and
issued in uncertificated book-entry form to such Indemnitors account as shall
be specified in the completed Letter of Transmittal and (B) Escrowed Cash
equal to fifty percent (50%) of such amount; and

(v) all written instructions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent with
respect to any distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be consistent
with this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ and the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 10.06 No Contribution. Subject to the rights of the Indemnified
Parties under  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, no Indemnitor shall have, or be
entitled to exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right
of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which he, she or it may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

 

Section 10.07 Defense of Third-Party Claims. Except as otherwise provided
in _Article_ __ _ 7_, in the event of the assertion of any claim or the
commencement by any Person of any Proceeding against an Indemnitee with
respect to which any of the Indemnitors may become obligated to hold
harmless, 

 



97

    

 indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article_
__ _ 10_ (each, a " _Claim_ "), Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice
of any such Claim, notify the Securityholder Representative of the
commencement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure on the part of
Parent to so notify the Securityholder Representative shall not limit any of
the obligations of the Indemnitors under this _Article_ __ _ 10_ (except to
the extent such failure actually and materially prejudices the defense of such
Proceeding). Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with,
and to control, the defense of such Claim on its own; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Securityholder Representative and its counsel (at the Indemnitors
sole expense) may participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense
of such Claim in a manner that would not result in the loss of any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product privilege or any other legal
privilege. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such Claim, the
Securityholder Representative shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each Indemnitor to, make available to Parent any documents and materials
in such Persons possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the
defense of such Claim. Parent shall not settle any such Claim that it is
conducting the defense of without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative (which such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 10.08 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No
Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim
or the exercise of such other remedy.

ARTICLE 11. 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 11.01 Securityholder Representative.

 

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Mergers and the other Transactions by the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
each of the Securityholders shall have irrevocably constituted and appointed,
upon the Effective Time (and by its execution of this Agreement as
Securityholder Representative, Shareholder Representative Services LLC hereby
accepts its appointment) as the true, exclusive and lawful agent and attorney-
in-fact (the " _Securityholder_ _Representative_ "), of the Securityholders
receiving consideration hereunder to act in the name, place and stead of the
Securityholders in connection with the Transactions, in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, and to act on behalf of
the Securityholders in any Proceeding involving this Agreement, to do or
refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Securityholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Transactions, including the power:

(i) to act for the Securityholders with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of the Securityholders and to
transact matters of litigation or other Proceedings, with respect to any funds
to be released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (but, for clarity, not
including any Damages in excess of funds then remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund);

 

(ii) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Securityholder
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions;

 



98

    

(iii) to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement
that the Securityholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether
prior to, at or after the Closing;

 

(iv) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Securityholders
and apply such funds in payment for such expenses;

(v) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of
the Securityholders that the Securityholder Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as the Securityholders could do if
personally present; and

 

(vi) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Securityholder Representative may be removed or replaced only upon
delivery of written notice to the Surviving Company by the Company
Stockholders holding at least a majority of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent, the Surviving Company and
any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon
any action of the Securityholder Representative in all matters referred to
herein. The Securityholder Representative shall act for the Securityholders
on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the
Securityholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the
Securityholders and consistent with the obligations under this Agreement, but
neither the Securityholder Representative nor any member of the
Securityholder Representatives Advisory Committee (the " _Advisory Committee_
") shall be responsible to the Securityholders for any Damages the
Securityholders may suffer by the performance of its duties under this
Agreement, other than Damages arising from willful violation of the law or
gross negligence in the performance of the duties of the Stockholder
Representative or such member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, under
this Agreement. The Indemnitors will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Securityholder Representative and each member of the Advisory Committee from
and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and relating to document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Securityholder Representatives execution and performance
of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the event that
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Securityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory Committee, the
Securityholder Representative or such member of the Advisory Committee will
reimburse the Indemnitors the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
to the extent attributable to such fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholder Representative or such
member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, by the Indemnitors, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder Representative
or such member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, from the funds in the
Securityholder Expense Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Indemnitors; _provided_ , that while this section
allows the Securityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory
Committee, as applicable, to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Indemnitors from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Securityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory
Committee, as applicable from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Securityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the
Securityholders set forth elsewhere in 

 



99

    

 this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided
to the Securityholder Representative under this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_. The
foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing or the resignation or removal
of the Securityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Securityholder Representative shall use the Securityholder Expense
Fund to pay any expenses incurred by the Securityholder Representative in
fulfilling its obligations hereunder and shall distribute any remaining
balance of the Securityholder Expense Fund to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Securityholders upon completion by the Securityholder
Representative of its duties hereunder. Any such distributions from the
Securityholder Expense Fund shall be paid to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Indemnitors, with equal priority and pro rata based on
each such Securityholders Pro Rata Share. The Securityholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Securityholder Expense Fund and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholder Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Securityholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Securityholder Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. For tax purposes, the Securityholder
Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside
by the Securityholders at the time of Closing.

Section 11.04 Entire Agreement; Severability; Amendments and Waivers.

written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

 

(b) If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as

manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the

 



101

    

 Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

(c) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party or, in the case of a
waiver, by each Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. 

(d) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or

of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the
obligations of any Non-Recourse Party under any Ancillary Agreement to which
such Non-Recourse Party is party, even if the basis for obligations
thereunder relate to or arise from obligations hereunder. Without limiting the
rights of any party against the other Parties hereto, in no event shall any
party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make
any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, any Non-Recourse Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (including in

of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 11.09 Jurisdiction _._ The Parties agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in
_Section 11.02_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

Section 11.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

Section 11.11 Consent to Representation. If the Securityholder
Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the Securityholders and
without the need for any consent or waiver by the Company, Parent, Merger Subs
or any other Person, Skadden shall be permitted to represent the
Securityholders (or any of them) after the Closing in connection with any
matter, including any matter related to the Transactions, any Ancillary
Documents or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Skadden shall
be permitted to represent the Securityholders, any of their agents and
Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation,
transaction or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other
adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their
agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any Transaction, and
any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under any Ancillary
Documents, including with respect to any indemnification claims hereunder or
any claims arising out of alleged Fraud or other similar matters. Any
representation of the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 

Section 11.12 Privilege. After the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) not to
use any legal advice provided by either Skadden or Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati to the Company, the Securityholder Representative or any
Securityholder, relating to the Transactions (" _Company Transactions Legal
Advice_ ") in connection with any indemnification claim dispute hereunder or
any other legal proceeding or potential legal proceeding against, with or
involving Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates or agents.
After the Effective Time, the Securityholder Representative shall be permitted
to access and use Company Transactions Legal Advice in connection with any
indemnification claim dispute hereunder or any other legal proceeding or
potential legal proceeding against, with or involving Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Affiliates or agents; and Skadden, the Securityholder
Representative and any Securityholder may make any such Company Transactions
Legal Advice available to Skadden or the Securityholder Representative, as the
case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent, the Surviving Company and any
of their Affiliates and agents may access and use for any purpose facts,
data and any other information

 



103

    

 contained in any communications between Skadden, on the one hand, and the
Company, the Securityholder Representative or any Securityholder, on the other
hand, to the extent such communications belong to the Surviving Company even
if such communication also contains Company Transactions Legal Advice,
including as evidence in any indemnification claim dispute or any other legal
proceeding or potential legal proceeding involving the Securityholder
Representative or any Securityholder, but for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding the Company Transactions Legal Advice contained in such
communications. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _
11.12_ or in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable
privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of
any client communications to any third party.

 

Section 11.13 Counterparts; Effectiveness _._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and
unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
Parties, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement
(in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.
