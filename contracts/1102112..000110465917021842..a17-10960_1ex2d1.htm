Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the

and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until such time as their successors
shall be duly elected and qualified.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in § 259 of the DGCL and § 1107 of the CGCL, including
any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Parent shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving

writing). The Merger provided for herein shall become effective at the time
the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary, or such
later time as may be agreed by the Parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger and the CA Agreement of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE 3

 


CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 



 

3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Person:

 



 

(a) _Outstanding Company Common Stock_. Subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 7.01(g), each share of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ " and,
collectively, " _Shares_ "), excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become
and be converted into the right to receive (i) $12.00 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.5308 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon. At
the Effective Time, all Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any Shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") and each holder of a Share not represented by a Certificate
(a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), other than any Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration plus any dividends or distributions to
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03(c)
as well as any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03(d).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Outstanding Parent Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

(c) _Outstanding Series A Preferred Stock_. Prior to Closing, Parent and the
Company agree to reasonably cooperate with respect to the purchase by the
Company in accordance with Section 5.21 of this Agreement (" _Preferred Stock
Purchase_ ") from the United States Department of the Treasury (the "
_Treasury Department_ ") all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the
Treasury Department, and following the Preferred Stock Purchase (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall occur at or immediately prior to the Closing),
all of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be cancelled, and no payment or
distribution shall be made in consideration therefor.

 



 

(d) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. (i) Any shares of Company Common Stock
held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted (" _Excluded Shares_ ") and (ii) subject to Section
3.01(e), any Dissenting Shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the Merger and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 



 

(e) _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(i) No later than ten (10) calendar days following the date that the Company
Shareholder Approval is received, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall provide each record holder of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on
the Merger with a notice including the information set forth in Section
1301(a) of the CGCL.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent dissenters rights under Section 1301(a) are applicable to the Merger,
no Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive
the applicable consideration for such shares set forth in this Agreement, if
any, but the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such
dissenters rights to the extent granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands that the Company purchase
such shares under Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall thereafter effectively withdraw
or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock then, as of the
occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such share of Company Common Stock
shall be deemed as of the Effective Time to have been converted into and
represent only the right to receive, in accordance with Section 3.01, the
Merger Consideration for such shares set forth in this Article III.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Chapter
13 of the CGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give
Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for purchase of any such shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Chapter 13 of the
CGCL and received by the Company in connection therewith and (B) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to purchase of any shares of Company Common Stock under Chapter 13 of
the CGCL; _provided_ that Parent shall act in a commercially reasonable manner
in directing any such negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by law,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of
Company Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor). After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

3.03 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares (in each case, other than holders of Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares), an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus
any cash due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.03(d) and
certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book-entry form
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.03(f)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the transmittal materials, pursuant
to the provisions of this Article III, and after the Effective Time, if
applicable, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock (such amount in cash and certificates for shares of Parent
Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Company shall notify Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time of the
number of Shares, Excluded Shares and, to the extent practicable, Dissenting
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall cause
the Companys transfer agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent on or prior to
the Closing Date a list of the holders of Company Common Stock in a format
that is reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) notice advising such
holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal
materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 3.03(f)) and
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message"

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form and have such
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree). Upon the surrender
of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable)
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided
in Section 3.03(g)) equal to (A) the Cash Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE 3 plus (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares plus (C) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other
dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be
issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Exchange Agent is presented
with the Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-
Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined
by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of
the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Fund shall be administered by
the Exchange Agent until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

3.04 __Treatment of Equity Awards__.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Companys 2007 Equity and Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ") or the
1st Enterprise Bank 2006 Stock

 



      
 

 



 

Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Company Stock Option Plan_ "), whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company Option to receive, as soon as administratively practicable after
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any,
of (A) the Equity Award Cashout Price over (B) the exercise price per Share
under such Company Option, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (such amount, the " _Option Consideration_ ");
_provided_ that to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall have the
option to fund the Option Consideration to be paid with respect to Company
Options by funding the necessary amounts to the payroll processor of the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates (the " _Payroll
Processor_ ") for payment by the Payroll Processor of the Option Consideration
to the applicable holders of such Company Options. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Company Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cashout Price shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes
of this Agreement, the " _Equity Award Cashout Price_ " shall mean an amount
equal to (1) the Cash Consideration plus (2) the product of (x) the Parent
Average Closing Price and (y) the Exchange Ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant
to Section 7.01(g).

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions
applicable to each outstanding restricted stock award (a " _Company Restricted
Share_ ") under the Company Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and such
Company Restricted Share shall be converted into, and become exchanged for,
the Merger Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such vesting, which Tax withholding may, at the election of the
holder, be effected by deduction from such Merger Consideration of a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock having a fair market value, based on the closing

Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted
to the Company or any of its advisors. The Company shall not, without the

Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Meeting, (B) after consultation with Parent, if the

Shareholder Approval. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Company Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company
Charter or the Company Bylaws or in connection with a postponement or
adjournment of the Company Meeting permitted by this Section 5.04. Without the
prior written consent of Parent, approval of the principal terms of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure (including a
customary adjournment proposal to solicit additional proxies if necessary to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval) and matters required by applicable
Law to be voted on by the Companys shareholders in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the

(a) The Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as defined below), and Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the

in the Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus (the "
_Prospectus/Proxy Statement_ ") constituting a part thereof, the "
_Registration Statement_ "), as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within forty-five (45) Business Days after the date hereof. Parent and the
Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have

 



      
 

 



 

the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter the Company
shall mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common
Stock. Parent shall reasonably promptly provide the Company with copies of any
written comments and advise the Company of any oral comments with respect to
the Registration Statement received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate

that (i) the Registration Statement will not, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case with
respect to the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will not, at the date of mailing to Company shareholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting to be held in connection with the
Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent will cause the
Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that if such Party shall
become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by such
Party that would cause any of the statements in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or that would
result in an omission to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other Party
thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement.

 



 

(c)

 



 

(i) The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval
contemplated by this Agreement is obtained, the Company Board may withhold,
withdraw or adversely modify the Company Board Recommendation or approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made to the
Company after the date hereof that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
facilitated in breach of this Agreement, if (A) an unsolicited bona fide
written offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn and the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (B) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would result in a violation of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that no such
Company Change of Recommendation may be made until after (I) at least five (5)
Business Days following Parents receipt of notice from the Company advising
that the Company Board intends to take such action and the basis therefor,
including all necessary information under Section 5.08 and (II) the Company
has negotiated in good faith to permit Parent to modify this Agreement during
such five (5) Business Day period. In determining whether to make a Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other
information provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.06, including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 5.06.

 



 

(d) _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger and this Agreement
and (except with respect to a Company Change of Recommendation, subject to
compliance with Section 5.06(c)) and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided,
however,_ that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice
of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules or regulations of NASDAQ or
the SEC. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as

warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such
Partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

5.08 _Acquisition Proposals_. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees
and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries agents and representatives
(including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or
acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit,
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents and representatives
(including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or
acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in no way eliminate or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have
under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after, the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, providing information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less
restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; or (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions
with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in
clause (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The
Company agrees that it will take the

 



      
 

 



 

necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.08. The
Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly, but in no event later than
the next succeeding Business Day, if any such inquiries, proposals or offers
are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any
of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

 



 

5.09 _Certain Policies_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided
that Parent has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations to
effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to
effect the Merger, the Company and CU Bank shall, consistent with GAAP, the
rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDBO,
FDIC and applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate
owned, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies
and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to
be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of PW Bank; _provided,
however,_ that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary
to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory accounting principles
and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a
breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or
failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement
by the Company that any such modification or change is appropriate or required
or that any financial statement or information previously provided by the
Company was incorrect in any respect.

 



 

5.10 _Regulatory Applications_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of Parent cause to
be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other
filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or
Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any initial filings
with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution hereof and in any event within forty-five (45)
calendar days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult with
the other on, all written information submitted to any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other
Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and/or Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Party apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including

 



      
 

 



 

promptly furnishing the other with copies of the non-confidential portions of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, from any third party and/or Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, to the extent permitted by Law, providing descriptions of any
oral communications from such Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities that would reasonably
be likely, in each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the
action, condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to the Company)
or a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) require Parent, PW Bank or the
Surviving Corporation or the surviving bank in the Bank Merger to raise
additional capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic
benefits of the Merger to Parent or the holders of Parent Common Stock
(including the Company shareholders in respect of shares of Parent Common
Stock received by them in the Merger) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or

5.11 _Indemnification; Director s and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(each a " _Claim_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and
observe the obligations of the Company under any agreements in effect as of
the date of this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any
time been directors and officers of the Company for their acts and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officers or
directors.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that none of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent; _provided, however,_ that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide that portion of directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the
Company with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising
from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, which DandO
Insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous to such officers and directors, as
that coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the
aggregate for such six (6)-year period more than 250% of the current amount
expended on an annual basis by the Company to maintain or procure such DandO
Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section
5.11, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to
250% of the current annual premium; _provided, further,_ that officers and
directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the Surviving Corporations
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance. In lieu of
the foregoing, Parent shall or, with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company may, purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, at an
aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 250% of the current annual premium for
such insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section
5.11(c).

 



       
 

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 



 

5.12 _Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof, Parent
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who
continue employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (such employees " _Continuing Employees_ ") with a base salary
or base wage, cash incentive opportunities and pension and welfare
opportunities (excluding equity and long term incentive compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
employee benefit and compensation plans to take into account, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the
service of the Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including any predecessor entities) as if such service were with Parent, to
the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or
its Subsidiaries and for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early
retirement benefits).

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of
Section 5.12(a), with respect to each Continuing Employee (and their
beneficiaries) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which each such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were
covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide full credit under
medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees (and their beneficiaries)
under analogous plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to
participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to such Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries on or after
the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied
any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the
Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall cause the Companys 401(k) Plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Plan has
been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of such
termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(e) To the extent any Benefit Plan limits the amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) in order to preclude such amount from being considered
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
the Company shall not waive any such limitation or amend any such Benefit Plan
to eliminate or materially alter such limitation.

 



 

(f) Prior to making any written or oral communications to a broad-based group
of the officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are materially affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the
Company shall consider any such comments in good faith.

 



 

5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

 



 

5.14 _Third-Party Agreements_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) the
consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (in such form and content as mutually agreed by the
Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of
such third parties (including at Parents request, with respect to the
termination of Contracts following the Effective Time) to effect a smooth
transition in accordance with the Parties timetable at or after the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), each of the Parties
shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing
and other processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing
all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data
and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parents
production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a
successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time)
mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws
regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition.
Among other things, the Company shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project
plan to effectuate the conversion;

 



 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Companys outside
contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its ongoing
needs until the conversion can be established;

 



 

(iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any
outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested
by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably
practicable;

 



 

(iv) provide reasonable access to the Companys personnel and facilities and,
with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors
personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on
schedule; and

 



 

(v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data,
item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by
Parent.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall
be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business
activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of the month, the
Company shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and

regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting
requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such
financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Companys
chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that
such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of
the certificate, the financial condition of the Company in all material
respects. Such Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for
all Professional Fees incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not
doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be accompanied by a certificate
of the Companys chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to
the effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of this
Section 5.15.

 



      
 

 



 

5.16 _NASDAQ Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

(d) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the
Company Shareholder Approval, by action of the Company Board if there has been
a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by
Parent, such that if continuing on the Closing Date, one of Sections 6.02(a)
or 6.02(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice thereof is given by the Company (or such shorter period as remaining
prior to the End Date); _provided_ that the Company is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement;

 



 

(e) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the
Company Shareholder Approval, by action of the Parent Board if there has been
a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the
Company, such that if continuing on the Closing Date, one of Section 6.03(a)
or 6.03(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice thereof is given by Parent (or such shorter period as remaining prior
to the End Date); _provided_ that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation warranty, covenant or agreement;

 



 

(f) at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, by action of the
Parent Board, in the event (A) the Company shall have breached in any material
respect Section 5.08; (B) the Company Board shall have effected a Company
Change of Recommendation; (C) at any time after the end of ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board shall
have failed to reaffirm its Company Board Recommendation as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt of
any written request to do so by Parent; or (D) a tender offer or exchange
offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been publicly
disclosed (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) and the Company
Board recommends that its shareholders tender their shares in such tender or
exchange offer or, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of
such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend
unequivocally against acceptance of such offer;

 



 

(g) by action of the Company Board, by written notice to Parent on the
Business Day immediately following the Determination Date, effective as of the
date that is three (3) Business Days following the date of such written
notice, in the event that:

 



       
 

 



 

(i) The Parent Average Closing Price is less than $44.84 per share (with a
proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement
and the Determination Date); and

 



 

(ii) The number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by the
Initial Parent Stock Price is less than the number obtained by subtracting (A)
the Index Ratio minus (B) 0.15.

 



 

If the Company elects to terminate pursuant to this Section 7.01(g) and
provides such written notice to Parent, then within two (2) Business Days
following Parents receipt of such notice, Parent may elect by written notice
to the Company to reinstate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (A) adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal a number equal to
the lesser of (I) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the
numerator of which is $23.80 and the denominator of which is the Parent
Average Closing Price and (II) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth), the numerator of which is $23.80 and the denominator of which is
the Parent Average Closing Price, multiplied by the Index Ratio, or (B) in the
alternative, not adjust the Exchange Ratio, and, in lieu of thereof, add an
amount in cash to the Cash Consideration such that each holder of Company
Common Stock would be entitled to receive, in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock, the equivalent value, based on the Parent Average Closing Price
for each share of Company Common Stock as such holder would have received had
the Exchange Ratio been adjusted in accordance with clause (A). If Parent
makes such election to reinstate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, no termination will occur pursuant to this
Section 7.01(g) and this Agreement will remain in effect according to its
terms (except as the Merger Consideration has been adjusted).

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
indicated below:

 



 

" _Determination Date_ " means the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

" _Determination Period_ " means the period beginning on the day that is
twenty (20) consecutive trading days prior to the Determination Date and
ending on the Determination Date.

 



 

" _Final Index Price_ " means the average closing price of the KBW Regional
Banking Index as quoted on Bloomberg.com (KRX:IND) during the Determination
Period.

 



 

" _Index Ratio_ " means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index
Price.

 



 

" _Initial Index Price_ " means 105.39.

 



 

" _Initial Parent Stock Price_ " means $52.75 per share.

 



 

If Parent or any company belonging to the KBW Regional Banking Index declares
or effects a stock dividend, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination
Date, the prices for the common stock of such company will be appropriately
adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 7.01(g).

 



      
 

 



 

7.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VII, this Agreement shall become void and of

any Party (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and
financial advisors or other representatives), except (i) as provided in
Section 7.02(b) and (ii) that no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) (i) The Company shall pay a termination fee of $26,500,000 (the "

(A) in the event that (1) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or its shareholders generally or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company, (2) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to (x) Section 7.01(b) for
failure of the Merger to be consummated by the End Date and the Company
Shareholder Approval has not been obtained or (y) Section 7.01(c)(ii), and (3)
within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section
7.02(b)(i)(A), the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall instead refer to "50%"; or

 



 

(B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(f).

 



 

(ii) Any Termination Fee required by this Section 7.02 shall be paid promptly,
but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
termination; _provided_ that with respect to clause (A) above, the Termination
Fee shall be paid immediately prior to the Companys entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummation of, an Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in paragraph (b)
above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that without such agreements Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If the Company
fails to promptly pay Parent any amounts due under paragraph (b) above within
the time period specified therein, the Company shall pay all costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent from the date such
amounts were required to be paid in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with
interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the publicly announced
prime rate of interest printed in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such
payment was required to be made.

8.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived in whole or in part by the Party benefited by the
provision or by both Parties or (ii) amended or modified at any time, by an
agreement in writing between the Parties hereto executed in the same manner as
this Agreement, except that after the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, this Agreement may not be amended if it would reduce the aggregate
value of the consideration to be received by the Company shareholders in the
Merger without any subsequent approval by such shareholders or be in violation
of applicable Law.

 



 

8.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed to
constitute an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

California are mandatorily applicable to the Merger, in which case the Laws of
the State of California shall govern, this Agreement shall be deemed to be
made in and in all respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by
and in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
the conflict of law principles thereof. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit
to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and the other documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive,
and agree to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or

irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by

Agreement and the other documents referred to in this Agreement, and in

8.08 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule
attached hereto and incorporated herein), the Voting Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties, both written and oral, between the Parties or
their officers, directors, agents, employees or representatives, with respect
to the subject matter hereof. Except for Section 5.11, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other
than the Parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

8.09 _Effect_. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require

any action or omit to take any action which action or omission would violate
any applicable Law (whether statutory or common Law), rule or regulation.

 



 

8.10 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
8.10 would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Company Material
Adverse Effect or would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company or Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek

other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

8.12 _Interpretation_ _._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Schedule
to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do
not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation".

 



 

8.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise.
