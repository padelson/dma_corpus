Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, for the consideration specified in Section 3.1, effective as of the Effective Time, Seller will sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller, the Shares. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

PURCHASE PRICE 

  

 SECTION 3.1 _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer and delivery of the Shares, at the Closing, subject to satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in Article X and Article XI hereof and subject to Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to the Seller Bank Account, an amount equal to one billion and two hundred ninety six million dollars ($1,296,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2(b), less any applicable withholding taxes. In addition, Buyer will pay at the Closing the amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.19 in the manner set forth in Section 8.19 (together with the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to terms hereof, the " _Purchase Price_ "); it being understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any amount paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.19 shall be included in the calculation of the Financial Indebtedness at the Closing for the purposes of determining the purchase price adjustment as set forth in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3. 

   

 SECTION 3.2 _Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) After the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth Sellers good faith determination of (i) the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the Financial Indebtedness as of the closing of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Financial Indebtedness_ "), in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis with Sellers past practices and the accounting principles, policies and methodologies utilized in the preparation of the latest 

     ##### 

  

    

balance sheets of the Acquired Companies included in the year-end audited
Financial Statements. In the event that no fewer than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date Buyer notifies Seller of any errors that Buyer
believes are contained in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Seller shall
in good faith consider Buyers comments relating to such errors and make
any amendments to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet which Seller reasonably
deems necessary to correct such errors. 

   

 (b) At the Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount (whether positive or negative) equal to (i) the amount of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital minus the Target Closing Net Working Capital _minus_ (ii) the amount of Estimated Closing Financial Indebtedness (the " _Closing Adjustment Amount_ "). 

   

 SECTION 3.3 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller, a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies (the " _Actual Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth (i) the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Actual Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the Financial Indebtedness as of the closing of business on the Closing Date (the " _Actual Closing Financial Indebtedness_ "), in each case prepared in the same manner as the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (b) If Seller objects to the Actual Closing Balance Sheet prepared by Buyer, it shall notify Buyer in writing within sixty (60) days following its receipt of the Actual Closing Balance Sheet, and shall set forth with specificity the basis of its objection (" _Seller s Closing Balance Objection_"). Buyer and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve Sellers Closing Balance Objection, if any, within twenty (20) days thereafter. In connection therewith, each of Buyer and Seller shall provide to the other and its Representatives such access as is necessary to evaluate the Actual Closing Net Working Capital and Actual Closing Financial Indebtedness included in the Actual Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (c) If Buyer and Seller have been unable to resolve their differences with respect to Sellers Closing Balance Objection within the time period set forth in Section 3.3(b) above, Buyer and Seller shall, no later than five (5) days thereafter, retain an independent accounting firm of national repute acceptable to the parties (the " _Expert_ ") to resolve as an Expert any remaining matters of dispute in Sellers Closing Balance Objection. The parties shall be required to submit their position papers within ten (10) days after retention of the Expert, and the Expert shall render its determination no later than twenty (20) days after its retention. The Expert shall meet with the parties and their Representatives in the presence of the other party and its Representatives in order to finally resolve Sellers Closing Balance Objection. The Experts decision shall be binding and non-appealable. In resolving any disputed item, the Expert may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by Seller or Buyer or less than the smallest value for 

     ##### 

  

    

such item asserted by Seller or Buyer. The " _Final Closing Net Working
Capital_ " shall be equal to the Net Working Capital set forth in the Actual
Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(a) in the event there
is no Sellers Closing Balance Objection and shall be equal to the Net
Working Capital as agreed to by the parties or as determined by the Expert in
the event of a Sellers Closing Balance Objection. The " _Final Closing
Financial Indebtedness_ " shall be equal to the Financial Indebtedness set
forth in the Actual Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section
3.3(a) in the event there is no Sellers Closing Balance Objection and shall
be equal to the Financial Indebtedness as agreed to by the parties or as
determined by the Expert in the event of a Sellers Closing Balance
Objection. The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be shared equally by the
parties hereto. 

   

 (d) The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by an amount (whether positive or negative) equal to (i) the amount of the Final Closing Net Working Capital minus the Target Closing Net Working Capital, _minus_ (ii) the amount of Final Closing Financial Indebtedness, _minus_ (iii) the Closing Adjustment Amount (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_ "). If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller within two (2) Business Days after the determination thereof in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Seller Bank Account an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer within two (2) Business Days after the determination thereof in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Buyer Bank Account an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount.

 Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that except as set forth in the Schedules with specific reference to the particular Section or clause of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such Schedules relates (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent): 

   

 SECTION 6.1 _Organization and Standing_. Buyer is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Connecticut. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased or held under license by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. Buyer has previously made available to Seller complete and correct copies of Buyers certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable organizational documents), as amended to the date hereof.

 (a) Buyer has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement, and the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved by Buyer, and no other action on the part of Buyer is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equitable principles, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. 

   

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer nor the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions, nor compliance by Buyer with any of the terms or provisions hereof (i) results in a Violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing instruments) of Buyer or (ii) assuming that the Permits, orders, registrations and declarations referred to in Section 6.3 are obtained and the 

     ##### 

  

    

notices and filings referred to in Section 6.3 are made, (x) violates any
Order or Law applicable to Buyer, or (y) constitutes or results in a
Violation or amendment, cancellation, suspension or acceleration under, or
results in a loss of any benefit under any material Contract to which Buyer
is a party or by which Buyer or any of Buyers properties or assets may be
bound or affected and that would reasonably be expected to impair in any
material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 6.3 _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (a) the Required Consents and (b) the consents, approvals, waivers, filings, notices, declarations and registrations set forth in Schedule 6.3, no consents, approvals or waivers of, or filings, notices, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer or the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions, other than such consents, approvals, waivers, filings, notices, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 6.4 _Compliance_. Buyer is, as of the date hereof, in compliance with all Laws or Orders applicable to the Buyer, except for such non-compliance as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 6.5 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as expressly set forth in Schedule 6.5, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened, legal or administrative proceeding, claim, suit, action or investigation against or relating to Buyer, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling, writ or decree imposed upon Buyer, in each case, by or before any Governmental Authority, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 6.6 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Berenson and Company and Morgan Stanley, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Buyer, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates that is or would be a liability of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), or, in the event that Closing does not occur, the Acquired Companies. 

   

 SECTION 6.7 _Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for the purpose of investment only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of applicable securities Laws. Buyer agrees that 

    ##### 

  

    

the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available under such Act.

that Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs any incremental out-of-pocket
costs in processing, retrieving or transmitting any such information pursuant
to this Section 7.2, Buyer shall reimburse Seller and such Affiliate for the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs thereof promptly upon submission to Buyer
of an invoice therefor accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Section 8.4 with respect to any 

     ##### 

  

    

confidential information if it exercises the same care with regard to such
information as it takes to preserve confidentiality for its own similar
information and (y) Seller will be permitted to make such disclosures as are

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, a director or officer, of an Acquired Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director or officer of such Acquired Company at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent 

     ##### 

  

    

permitted under applicable Law, the Charter Documents as currently in effect
or the indemnification agreements with any of the Indemnitees in effect as of
the date hereof (solely to the extent such agreements have been provided to
Buyer prior to the date hereof), which shall survive the Transactions and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, from and after the Effective Time until
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Acquired Companies to contain provisions no
less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities
of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the
date of this Agreement in the Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of the Indemnitees. 

   

 (b) The provisions of this Section 8.6 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his heirs and his representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have by Contract or otherwise (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 8.6 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 8.6).

 (a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party with respect to any matter (other than claims, the basis for which, is set forth in Article XIII), or any Indemnified Party shall otherwise learn of an assertion or of a potential claim, by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will reasonably promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of the Third Party Claim, including the factual basis for the Third Party Claim, and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this Article XII, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all non-ministerial notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period prior to the time that the Indemnifying Party assumed the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days after 

     ##### 

  

    

receipt of notice of any Third Party Claim to elect to assume
defense thereof; _provided_ , that if at any time thereafter the Indemnified
Party fails in any material respect to adequately prosecute or pursue such
defense, then the Indemnifying Party shall again have the right to elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim after giving at least ten (10)
days of notice to the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall prior to
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim irrevocably acknowledge that
it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder from Damages
resulting from such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article XII and
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that (i) a conflict of
interest exists in respect of such claim or (ii) there may be legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified
Party will have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnifying Party to represent such Indemnified Party and, in
that event, the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but
not more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties) shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the
defense of the Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and
expense (except in the cases set forth in the preceding sentence), may retain
separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party will control such defense. 

   

 (c) No Indemnifying Party shall consent to any settlement, compromise or discharge (including the consent to entry of any judgment) of any Third Party Claim without each Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Damages in connection with such Third Party Claim and fully and irrevocably unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and each member of such Indemnified Partys group completely from all Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may refuse to agree to any such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or any member of such Indemnified Partys group, (y) that, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, would otherwise materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party or any member of such Indemnified Partys group or (z) where there is a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law or any violation of the rights of any Person. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to assume control over the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in Section 12.3(b) or having timely elected to defend a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party fails, after at least ten (10) days notice to the Indemnifying Party, in any material respect to adequately prosecute or pursue such defense, then the Indemnified Party shall, after giving at least twenty (20) days notice to the Indemnifying Party, have the right but not the obligation to assume control over the defense 

    ##### 

  

    

of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to any Third Party Claim for indemnification
hereunder relating to an alleged breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant that may materially adversely affect the Business as a result of
injunctive or similar equitable relief being sought, the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to defend, settle and compromise
such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not,
and will cause its Affiliates not to, admit any liability, consent to the
entry of any judgment or agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

   

 (d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will keep the Indemnified Party informed of all material developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, the parties shall cooperate in the defense thereof (and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such cooperation), which cooperation will include the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

   

 (e) Any claim on account of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement that does not involve a Third Party Claim will be asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is sought. The delay by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this Article XII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof. 

   

 (f) In connection with any matter for which a claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to, provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable and necessary access, upon reasonable request, to all documents, data, products, product exemplars and knowledgeable personnel of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates relevant to any such matter (and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such access). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to, provide employees to act as witnesses, prepare and execute statements, authorizations, orders, reports and other documents and information and provide such other assistance, in each case that is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection with any matter for which a claim or demand is made 

    ##### 

  

    

against an Indemnified Party under this Agreement, including in anticipation
of, or preparation for, existing or future litigation or other matters in
which the Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates is involved. 

   

 SECTION 12.4 _Certain Limitations_. 

   

 (a) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be reduced by any amounts actually received (including amounts received under insurance policies net of any increased insurance costs) by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party from third parties (net of out of pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with seeking to collect and collecting such amounts), in respect of such Damages (such net amounts are referred to herein as " _Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect of a claim which has been paid by an Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnified Claim_ ") for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement after the full amount of such Indemnified Claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such Indemnified Claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such Indemnified Claim, then the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Indemnified Claim, less (ii) the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Seller and Buyer shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, pursue promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to seek recovery for any Damages from any third party before seeking indemnification under this Agreement and in no event shall the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XII be conditioned upon the status of the recovery of any offsetting amounts from any such third party. 

   

 (b) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement, including under Section 13.8, will be (i) increased to take into account of any Tax cost incurred (grossed up for such increase) by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (unless such indemnity payment is treated as an 

   ##### 

  

 

adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes) and (ii) reduced to take
account of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages (treating for this purpose
any loss resulting in such Damages as being realized by the Indemnified Party
after all other losses of the Indemnified Party are realized for U.S. federal
income tax purposes). If a Tax benefit resulting from the incurrence or
payment of any Damages is actually realized after the time the indemnity
payment is made, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Tax benefit when actually realized, except that, upon the
agreement of the parties, the amount of such Tax benefit for purposes of this
Section 12.4(b) shall be taken into account upon the incurrence or payment of
such Damages and shall be equal to the net present value of all of
such actually realized Tax benefits. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this Agreement will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or a
similar event under foreign Tax Law with respect to the Indemnified Party
causes any such payment not to constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for United States federal Income Tax purposes or foreign Tax purposes, as the
case may be. 

   

 (c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the absence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no member of the Seller Group and no member of the Buyer Group will be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement for its own punitive, exemplary or consequential damages (except to the extent that such consequential damages are a natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of the applicable breach of representation, warranty or covenant); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent any member of the Seller Group or the Buyer Group from being indemnified for all components of awards against them in claims by third parties, including the punitive and exemplary or consequential components of such claims. 

   

 SECTION 12.5 _Termination of Indemnification Obligations_. 

   

 (a) Each and every representation and warranty of Seller or Buyer contained in Articles V and VI (other than Seller Fundamental Representations, Buyer Fundamental Representations, and Section 5.9(c), (d), (e) and (k) (Tax Matters)) shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections 12.1(a) and 12.2(a), as applicable until (and will expire and be of no further force or effect) eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. The Seller Fundamental Representations and Buyer Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing for purposes of Sections 12.1(a) and 12.2(a) indefinitely. Sellers representations and warranties with respect to tax contained in Section 5.9(c), (d), (e) and (k) will survive the Closing solely for purposes of Section 13.8 until (and will expire when and be of no further force or effect when) the date that is sixty (60) days following the applicable statute of limitation (including any extension thereof). 

   

 (b) The obligations of each party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the applicable Persons (i) pursuant to Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b) will terminate upon the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof),

##### 

 

  

(ii) pursuant to Sections 12.1(a) and 12.2(a) will terminate when the
applicable representation or warranty expires pursuant to Section 12.5(a),
and (iii) pursuant to Sections 12.2(c) and 12.2(d) will not terminate at any
time; _provided_ , _however_ , that as to clauses (i) and (ii) above, such
obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate with
respect to any individual item as to which an Indemnified Party shall
have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim
by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
to the applicable Indemnifying Party. 

   

 SECTION 12.6 _Dollar Limitations_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 12.6(c), (i) no monetary amount will be payable by Seller to any member of the Buyer Group with respect to the indemnification of any claims pursuant to Section 12.1(a) until the aggregate amount of Damages actually incurred by the Buyer Group with respect to such claims shall exceed on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event Seller shall be responsible for the entire amount of such Damages in excess of $7,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and (ii) no monetary amount will be payable by Buyer to any member of the Seller Group with respect to the indemnification of any claims pursuant to Section 12.2(a) until the aggregate amount of Damages actually incurred by the Seller Group with respect to such claims shall exceed on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Basket, in which event Buyer shall be responsible for the entire amount of such Damages in excess of the Deductible. In connection with (i) any claim for indemnification under Section 12.1(a), Buyer and the other members of the Buyer Group will promptly provide Seller with written notice of all claims included in the Basket and copies of all documents reasonably requested by Seller relating thereto and (ii) any claim for indemnification under Section 12.2(a), Seller and the other members of the Seller Group will promptly provide Buyer with written notice of all claims included in the Basket and copies of all documents reasonably requested by Buyer relating thereto. In addition, (i) Seller will not be responsible for making payments with respect to Damages for any individual items or series of related items pursuant to Section 12.1(a) where the aggregate Damages relating thereto are less than $300,000 with respect to any representation and warranty made as of the date hereof and $500,000 with respect to any representation and warranty made as of the Closing Date (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ ") and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of determining whether aggregate Damages incurred by the Buyer Group exceed the Basket and (ii) Buyer will not be responsible for making payments with respect to Damages for individual items or series of related items pursuant to Section 12.2(a) where the aggregate Damages relating thereto are less than the Per Claim Threshold and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of determining whether aggregate Damages incurred by the Seller Group exceed the Basket. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 12.6(c), (i) in no event will the aggregate amount for which Seller shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Buyer Group for all claims under Section 12.1(a) exceed, and Sellers aggregate liability under Section 12.1(a) shall be limited to, an amount equal to $95,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") and (ii) in no event will the aggregate amount for which Buyer shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Seller Group 

   ##### 

  

 

for all claims under Section 12.2(a) exceed, and Buyers aggregate liability
under Section 12.2(a) shall be limited to, an amount equal to the Cap. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Basket, the Deductible and the Cap shall not be applicable to, and the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified in full for, Damages (i) arising out of, relating to or resulting from breaches or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations, or (ii) arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Seller or Buyer. 

  

 (d) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in no event will the aggregate amount for which Seller shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Buyer Group for all claims under this Agreement, including Section 12.1 and Section 13.8, exceed, and Sellers aggregate liability under this Agreement, including Section 12.1 and Section 13.8, shall be limited to, an amount equal to the Purchase Price and (ii) in no event will the aggregate amount for which Buyer shall be responsible to indemnify all members of the Seller Group for all claims under this Agreement, including Section 12.2 and Section 13.8, exceed, and Buyers aggregate liability under this Agreement, including Section 12.2 and Section 13.8, shall be limited to, an amount equal to the Purchase Price. 

  

 SECTION 12.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, other than in connection with claims arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the indemnification provided in this Article XII and Section 13.8 and specific performance pursuant to Section 15.8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available to each of the parties and their respective Affiliates and each member of the Seller Group and Buyer Group for breaches of any of the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or for any other claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Transition Agreement, and shall preclude assertion by members of the Seller Group or Buyer Group of any of other rights, claims or causes of action or the seeking of any other remedies, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, under Law (including statutory or common law) or otherwise, against Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) or against Seller (or any of its Affiliates), respectively, with respect to breaches of any of the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or for any other claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Transition Agreement, in each case whether known or unknown and including claims resulting from actions or claims of Governmental Authorities or third parties, all of which Buyer (on behalf of itself and the other members of the Buyer Group) and Seller (on behalf of itself and the other members of the Seller Group) hereby waives.

ARTICLE XIII 

   

TAX MATTERS 

  

 SECTION 13.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Seller will prepare and timely file or will cause to be prepared and timely filed all appropriate federal, state, provincial, local and foreign Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies and their assets or activities that (a) are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date or (b) are required to be filed after the Closing Date and (i) are Consolidated Tax Returns or (ii) are with respect to Income Taxes and are required to be filed on a separate Tax Return basis for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer hereby irrevocably designates, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to so designate, Seller as its agent to take any and all actions necessary or incidental to the preparation and filing of such Consolidated Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared and will timely file or cause to be timely filed all other Tax Returns required of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), or in respect of their assets or activities. Any such Tax Returns (including amendments thereto) that include periods ending on or before the Closing Date or that include the assets or activities of any of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date will, unless Seller and Buyer otherwise agree in writing, be prepared on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods, conventions and principles of taxation used for the most recent taxable periods for which Tax Returns involving similar matters have been filed. Upon the request of the non-responsible party, the party responsible for the preparation of a particular Tax Return shall make available a draft of such Tax Return (or relevant portions thereof) for review and comment by such non-responsible party. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, all decisions relating to the preparation of Tax Returns shall be made in the sole discretion of the party responsible under this Agreement for such preparation. 

  

 SECTION 13.2 _Payment of Taxes_. From and after the Effective Time: (a) Seller will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to Tax Returns which Seller is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 13.1; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer hereby assumes and agrees to pay directly to or at the direction of Seller, at least five (5) days prior to the date payment (including estimated payment) thereof is due (x) Taxes relating to the Acquired Companies to the extent of the amount that has been accrued for Taxes on the Financial Statements and (y) the share of such Taxes relating to the Acquired Companies for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning the day after the Closing Date and (b) Buyer will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to Tax Returns which Buyer is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 13.1; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller hereby assumes and agrees to pay directly to or at the direction of Buyer, at least five (5) days prior to the date payment (including estimated payment) thereof is due, the share of such Taxes relating to the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, but only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount accrued for Taxes on the Financial Statements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 13.3 _Straddle Period Taxes_. With respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall determine the Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period by an interim closing of the books of each of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, except for ad valorem or property Taxes or other Taxes that are not based upon or related to income or receipts (" _Property Taxes_ ") and franchise Taxes based solely on capital which shall be prorated on a daily basis to the Closing Date. For this purpose, any franchise Tax paid or payable not based solely on capital with respect to the Acquired Companies shall be allocated to the taxable period for which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such Tax. All Property Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be pro rated on a per diem basis between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. If a Property Tax is imposed on a fiscal year basis, such Property Tax shall be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based on the number of days in such fiscal year covered by such periods. 

  

 SECTION 13.4 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements and arrangements between (a) any of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and (b) Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, will be terminated and have no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether a past, present or future year or period), and no additional payments will be made thereunder on or after the Closing Date in respect of a redetermination of Tax liabilities or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 13.5 _Carryforwards and Carrybacks_. Buyer will cause each of the Acquired Companies to elect, where permitted by Law, to carry forward any net operating loss, net capital loss, charitable contribution or other item arising after the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such an election, be carried back to a taxable period of any of the Acquired Companies ending on or before the Closing Date in which any of the Acquired Companies were included in a Consolidated Tax Return. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives any right to use or apply any net operating loss, net capital loss, charitable contribution or other item of any Acquired Company for any Tax year ending on any date following the Closing Date to any period of any Acquired Company ending on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any refund or credit of Income Taxes relating to the Acquired Companies which arises after the Closing Date but is attributable to the taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, shall be for the account and benefit of Seller and shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.6. 

  

 SECTION 13.6 _Refunds_.

otherwise) relating to Taxes with respect to any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date. Buyer and the Acquired Companies will be entitled to
retain, or receive immediate payment from Seller of, any refund or credit

pay any such Taxes pursuant to Section 13.2. The amount of any refund or
credit which Buyer or Seller is entitled to retain or receive pursuant to
this Section 13.6 shall be reduced to take account of any Taxes incurred upon
the receipt of such refund or credit. All payments required to be made
pursuant to this Section 13.6 shall be made within thirty (30) days

 (b) Seller shall be permitted to file or cause to be filed at Sellers sole expense, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with, any claims for refund of Taxes to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 13.6(a) or any other provision of this Agreement. Seller shall reimburse Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation. Buyer shall be permitted to file or cause to be filed at Buyers sole expense, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, any claims for refund of Taxes to which Buyer is entitled pursuant to Section 13.6(a) or any other provision of this Agreement. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation. 

  

 SECTION 13.7 _Tax Cooperation_. From and after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and Seller will cooperate with the other party, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in the preparation of any Tax Returns and in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving or relating to the Acquired Companies.

 SECTION 13.8 _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Group from and against (i) all Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Pre-Closing Straddle Period, (ii) all Liability (as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502 6(a) or otherwise) for Income Taxes of Seller or any other Person (other than any of the Acquired Companies) which is or has ever been affiliated with any of the Acquired Companies, or with whom any of the Acquired Companies otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return, prior to the Closing, (iii) any and all liability incurred by any member of the Buyer Group based upon the breach by Seller of the representations and warranties provided in Sections 5.9 (c), (d), (e) and (k), and (iv) all liability for any reasonable legal, accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees and expenses relating to the foregoing.

 (c) The obligations of each party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and other Persons, pursuant to Sections 13.8(a) and 13.8(b), will terminate thirty (30) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof);  _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate with respect to any individual item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the applicable Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (d) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 13.8 will be paid within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party makes written demand upon the Indemnifying Party, but in no case earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on

estimated Tax payments). 

   

 SECTION 13.9 _Tax Contests_. 

  

 (a) If a claim is made by any taxing authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 13.8, the Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notice will not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has actually been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

 (b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or relating to Income Taxes for any other taxable period in which any of the Acquired Companies joined in filing any Consolidated Tax Return, Seller will control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. Before taking any material action with respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim (including the submission of any protest, petitions, or responses to information document requests), Seller shall first obtain the consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.8(b), Seller and Buyer will jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period. Neither Seller nor Buyer will settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 (d) Each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand, will cooperate, at the request of the other, in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and (upon request) the provision to the requesting party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. The requesting party shall reimburse the party providing such cooperation for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation. 

  

 SECTION 13.10 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Seller and Buyer shall join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the Connecticut Companies and any corresponding elections under state or local law (each, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). As reasonably requested from time to time (whether before, 

   ##### 

  

 

at or after the Closing), each of Seller and Buyer will assist and provide the
necessary information to the other in connection with the preparation of any
form or document required to effect a valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including IRS Form 8883, any similar form under state or local law
and any schedules or attachments thereto (collectively, " _Section
338 Forms_"). Upon delivery to Seller of any Section 338 Form that has been
prepared in accordance with this Section 13.10, Seller will duly and promptly
execute such form and deliver it to Buyer. If Buyer determines that any
change is to be made in a Section 338 Form previously executed and delivered
to Seller, then Buyer may prepare a new Section 338 Form in accordance with
this Section 13.10 and deliver such new Section 338 Form to Seller, and
Seller will duly and promptly execute such form and deliver it to Buyer.
After the Closing Date but not more than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller an
allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") setting forth the
allocation of the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Acquired
Companies, plus other relevant items, to the assets of the Acquired Companies
for Income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the fair market values.
Within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Allocation Schedule,
Seller will deliver to Buyer a written notice (in reasonable detail)
indicating whether Seller disagrees with the Allocation Schedule. If Seller
fails to object in writing to the Allocation Schedule within such
30-day period, Seller shall be deemed conclusively to agree to the Allocation
Schedule and the Allocation Schedule will be final and binding upon the
parties. If Seller delivers to Buyer a notice of disagreement, Buyer and
Seller will work together in good faith to resolve such disagreement.
If Buyer and Seller have been unable to resolve such disagreement, Buyer and
Seller shall submit such disagreement to the Expert and the Expert shall
render its determination with thirty (30) days after the submission. The
Allocation Schedule will be subsequently amended as required by applicable
law as the parties may mutually agree. Each of Buyer, Seller and their
Affiliates will file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule (as amended pursuant to this Section 13.10). Except for a
Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the Connecticut Companies, Buyer
shall not be permitted to make an election under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to any Acquired Company that is a domestic corporation within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(4) of the Code.

 SECTION 14.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by written notice by Buyer to Seller, if there shall have been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of such time and such breach is 

   ##### 

  

 

not curable or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x)
ninety (90) days after written notice thereof is given by Seller to Buyer (
_provided_ , that Seller uses reasonable best efforts to cure such breach
during such 90-day period) and (y) the Outside Date;  _provided_ , _however_
, that Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause
any of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, as the case maybe,
not to be satisfied; 

   

 (c) by written notice by Seller to Buyer, if there shall have been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, in any such case such that the conditions set forth in Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of such time and such breach is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) ninety (90) days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer to Seller ( _provided_ , that Buyer uses reasonable best efforts to cure such breach during such 90-day period) and (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, as the case maybe, not to be satisfied; 

  

 (d) by written notice by Buyer to Seller or by Seller to Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to this Section 14.1(d) shall not have breached in any material respects its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that the breach shall have proximately caused the occurrence of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date; 

  

 (e) by written notice by Buyer to Seller or by Seller to Buyer, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to this Section 14.1(e) shall not have breached in any material respects its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that the breach shall have proximately caused the occurrence of any such prohibitive order; or 

  

 (f) by written notice by Buyer to Seller, if, at any time during the Marketing Period, the board of directors of Buyer reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation in good faith with an investment bank of international standing, that an offering of its common stock in an aggregate offering amount of up to $525 million (less the amount of any consummated common stock offering by Buyer after the date of this Agreement) to raise a portion of the Buyer Financing is not (in the case of any portion thereof) in the best interests of its shareholders (the " _Failed Buyer Financing Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may notify Buyer in writing within five (5) Business Days following its receipt of a Failed Buyer Financing Notice of its desire to work with Buyer in good faith for a period of up to forty-five (45) days to structure an alternative financing mutually acceptable to both parties or to extend the Marketing Period to sixty (60) days. If Seller does not provide such 

   ##### 

  

 

notice within such time period or the parties do not agree as to the business
and other terms and conditions related to such extension of the Marketing
Period or forty-five (45) day period, this Agreement will terminate at 5:00
pm New York Time on the sixth Business Day following delivery of the Failed
Buyer Financing Notice (it being understood and agreed that this Agreement may
not be terminated by Buyer during such six (6) day period following the
delivery of the Failed Buyer Financing Notice). 

   

 (g) by written notice by Seller to Buyer, if (i) the Marketing Period has been completed, and (ii) at the end of the Marketing Period, all of the conditions set forth in Article X have been satisfied (or, with respect to deliverables at Closing, are capable of being satisfied at Closing) except for Section 10.8. 

  

 SECTION 14.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder will terminate without any Liability on the part of either party or its Affiliates in respect thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.7, Section 14.2(b), Section 15.5, Section 15.6, Section 15.7, Section 15.9 and Section 15.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , further that, other than as provided in Section 14.2(b), nothing herein will relieve either party from Liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c) and all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article X are satisfied (or, with respect to deliverables at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied at Closing), (ii) Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(d), all of the Required Consents have been obtained and become Final Orders but the applicable PUC Consent has not been obtained or contains a Material Condition that Buyer has not waived and all of the other conditions to Closing set forth in Article X without regard to Section 10.8 are satisfied (or, with respect to deliverables at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied at Closing), (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.1(f), or (iv) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.1(g), then Buyer shall pay $50,000,000 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ "), to Seller no later than seven (7) Business Days after such termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated and a Buyer Termination Fee is paid or payable by Buyer to Seller, Sellers and its Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their current, former or future Affiliates and representatives, including for willful breach of this Agreement, shall be payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with the terms hereof and Seller shall be precluded from any other remedy against Buyer or the Debt Financing Sources at law or in equity or otherwise. Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 14.2 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 14.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment 

   ##### 

  

 

against Buyer for Buyer Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Buyer shall
pay to Seller its reasonable costs and expenses thereof (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary in this paragraph, if all conditions to Closing set forth in Article
X are satisfied (or, with respect to deliverables at Closing, are capable of
being satisfied at Closing), but Buyer does not consummate the Transactions,
then Seller shall be entitled to choose to seek to recover damages in lieu of
seeking the Buyer Termination Fee by providing Buyer notice of such election
three (3) Business Days before the Buyer Termination Fee is due.

 (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any Federal Court sitting in the State of New York, and the

New York. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 15.7 shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New
York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
Section 15.7 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties hereto. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. 

   

 (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).
