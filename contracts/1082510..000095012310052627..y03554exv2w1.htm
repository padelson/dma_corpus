14.2(b), Section&nbsp;15.5, Section&nbsp;15.6, Section&nbsp;15.7, Section&nbsp;15.9 and Section&nbsp;15.10 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, further that, other than as provided in Section

Agreement.

of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article&nbsp;X are satisfied (or, with respect to deliverables
at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied at Closing), (ii)&nbsp;Buyer or Seller terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.1(d), all of the Required Consents have been obtained and become
Final Orders but the applicable PUC Consent has not been obtained or contains a Material Condition
that Buyer has not waived and all of the other conditions to Closing set forth in Article&nbsp;X without

(iv)&nbsp;this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.1(g), then Buyer shall pay $50,000,000
(the &#147;<U>Buyer Termination Fee</U>&#148;), to Seller no later than seven (7)&nbsp;Business Days after such
termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated and a Buyer Termination Fee is paid or
payable by Buyer to Seller, Seller&#146;s and its Affiliates&#146; sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer,
the Debt Financing Sources or any of their current, former or future Affiliates and
representatives, including for willful breach of this Agreement, shall be payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee in accordance with the terms hereof and Seller shall be precluded from any other
remedy against Buyer or the Debt Financing Sources at law or in equity or otherwise. Buyer
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section&nbsp;14.2 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section&nbsp;14.2 and, in
