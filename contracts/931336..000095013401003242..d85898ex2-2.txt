                                   SECTION 2

                         SALE AND PURCHASE OF SECURITIES

         2.1. SALE AND PURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Holdings
will purchase (i) from DFA, its 33.8% common limited partner interests in SDG
(the "SDG COMMON INTERESTS"), which constitute all limited partner interests in
SDG owned, directly or indirectly, by DFA, and (ii) from Mid-Am, its $90 million
stated amount of preferred limited partner interests in SDG (the "SDG PREFERRED
INTERESTS"), which constitute all limited partner interests in SDG owned,
directly or indirectly, by Mid-Am. The SDG Common Interests and the SDG
Preferred Interests will be conveyed to Holdings free and clear of any
Encumbrances, pursuant to assignment documents in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the parties hereto.

         2.2. PURCHASE PRICE.

                  (a) In exchange for the SDG Common Interests and the SDG
         Preferred Interests, Holdings will (i) cause SDG or Dean Foods, as
         applicable, to transfer, sell and convey the Dairy Assets and the Dairy
         Liabilities to DFA, (ii) pay, or cause SDG to pay, an amount equal to
         $166 million in cash to DFA and Mid-Am, subject to adjustment as set
         forth below (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"), in the relative amounts
         designated by the DFA Companies at least 3 days prior to Closing, and
         (iii) deliver a subordinated promissory note executed by Suiza in the
         principal amount of $50,000,000 to DFA, in substantially the form of
         Exhibit C attached hereto (the "NOTE"). Items (i), (ii), and (iii) are
         collectively referred to as the "PURCHASE PRICE". SDG will not
         transfer, sell or convey the Excluded Assets to DFA and DFA will not
         assume and shall not be liable or responsible for any Excluded
         Liabilities. The Cash Consideration payable to DFA at Closing shall be
         (A) increased for DFA's and Mid-Am's pro rata share of the reported
         earnings of SDG from and including January 1, 2001 through the day
         immediately preceding the Closing Date, (B) decreased by (I)
         $2,535,000, plus (II) the amount of any distributions (including any
         distributions to be paid after Closing related to the period prior to
         the Closing Date) paid to DFA and Mid-Am of cash or other property and
         the amount of any deemed distributions (for stock option exercises)
         deemed paid to DFA and Mid-Am under the Limited Partnership Agreement,
         in the case of such distributions, from and including January 1, 2001
         and through the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (C)
         increased or decreased, as applicable, to the extent the Closing Date
         Working Capital is less than or greater than Stated Working Capital
         (collectively, the "CASH ADJUSTMENT").

                  (b) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, SDG and DFA
         shall work together in good faith to come to an agreement concerning
         (i) the amount of the Stated Working Capital and (ii) whether the Dairy
         Operations can be reasonably expected to generate annual EBITDA, as
         adjusted to exclude non-recurring items, to take into account Dairy
         Liabilities, Excluded Liabilities and Excluded Assets and to include
         reasonable overhead charges, all as mutually determined and agreed to
         by SDG and DFA, in an aggregate amount of approximately $40 million. If
         after making the determination set forth in clause (ii) above, SDG and
         DFA conclude that the Dairy Operations can





                                       7
<PAGE>   12

         reasonably be expected to generate materially more or less than $40
         million in annualized EBITDA, then SDG and DFA shall promptly, and in
         good faith, work together to agree on an appropriate adjustment to the
         Cash Consideration. Any adjustment to the Cash Consideration shall be
         paid by an increase or reduction in the amount of cash to be paid, as
         applicable, or, in the case of a shortfall, the transfer of additional
         dairy assets (and associated Dairy Liabilities) to DFA, or some
         combination of cash and such additional assets, as may be mutually
         agreed between SDG and DFA.

                  (c) If SDG and DFA are unable, no later than 30 days prior to
         the anticipated Closing Date, (i) to reach an agreement concerning the
         amount of Stated Working Capital or (ii) (A) to so determine that the
         Dairy Operations can be reasonably expected to generate the amount of
         EBITDA set forth in Section 2.2(b), or (B) if having made such
         determination, are thereafter unable to agree on any appropriate
         adjustment to the Cash Consideration or upon the quantity or identity
         of any such additional dairy assets to be conveyed, then any such
         dispute shall be submitted promptly to a nationally known independent
         certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to SDG and DFA
         (the "ACCOUNTANT"), which will determine, within 20 days after such
         submission, (x) the amount of the Stated Working Capital, and/or (y)
         the amount of such EBITDA or the appropriate adjustment to the Cash
         Consideration, as applicable. SDG and DFA will each pay one-half of the
         fees and expenses of the Accountant. Any such determination by the
         Accountant will be final and binding upon SDG and DFA.

                  (d) At least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, SDG
         shall deliver to DFA a good faith estimate, in reasonable detail, of
         the Cash Adjustment (the "ESTIMATED CASH ADJUSTMENT") which will be
         used to adjust the Cash Consideration at the Closing. Within sixty (60)
         days after the Closing, SDG will calculate the Cash Adjustment at the
         Closing and notify DFA of such calculation. If DFA disputes the
         accuracy of SDG's calculation within thirty (30) days after receipt
         thereof, and the parties are unable to settle such dispute within an
         additional fifteen (15) days, then the dispute shall be submitted
         promptly to the Accountant, which will determine the actual Cash
         Adjustment at the Closing. SDG and DFA will each pay one-half of the
         fees and expenses of the Accountant. Any such determination by the
         Accountant will be final and binding upon SDG and DFA. The actual Cash
         Adjustment at the Closing determined by SDG, by agreement between the
         parties or by the Accountant (as provided in this paragraph), is
         referred to as the "ACTUAL CASH ADJUSTMENT." If the Actual Cash
         Adjustment exceeds the Estimated Cash Adjustment, then SDG will pay to
         DFA the amount of such excess in cash by wire transfer of immediately
         available funds (to accounts specified in writing by DFA) within five
         (5) days after determination of the Actual Cash Adjustment. If the
         Actual Cash Adjustment is less than the Estimated Cash Adjustment, then
         DFA will pay to SDG the amount of such shortfall in cash by wire
         transfer of immediately available funds (to an account specified in
         writing by SDG) within five (5) days after determination of the Actual
         Cash Adjustment. Any payment required pursuant to this paragraph will
         be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

         2.3. CLOSING. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"CLOSING") will take place at the offices of Hughes & Luce, L.L.P. at 1717 Main
Street, Suite 2800, Dallas, Texas, at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on the third

Without limiting the foregoing, Suiza, Holdings, SDG, Suiza Southeast and each

         COMPANY") for the issuance of ALTA (or state equivalent) Owner's
         Policies of Title Insurance for each parcel of real property used in
         the Dairy Operations (each, a "TITLE POLICY"), each in an amount not to
         exceed the fair market value of each such parcel. Each Commitment shall

         Suiza Affiliate, Dean Foods Affiliate or the applicable landlord, as

         Encumbrances. Unless the issuance of same is generally legally
         prohibited by the insurance regulatory agency of the state in which the

         Company shall have all standard and general exceptions deleted so as to

         zoning 3.1 with parking, non-imputation, access, survey, utility
         facility, owner's comprehensive, contiguity (if applicable), deletion
         of creditors' rights exception, and such other endorsements as may be
         reasonably requested by DFA in order to insure over an Unpermitted
         Encumbrance or Survey Defect. At the Closing, Holdings shall deliver or
         cause to be delivered such affidavits or other instruments as the Title
         Company may reasonably require to delete standard and general
         exceptions and to provide the special endorsements required hereunder.
         Unless the issuance of same is generally legally prohibited by the
         insurance regulatory agency of the state in which the real property is
         located, Holdings shall cause the Commitments to be later-dated to
         cover the Closing and cause the Title Company to delete all Schedule B
         requirements and all standard exceptions in the Commitments at the
         Closing as directed by DFA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained in this Agreement, Holdings shall pay or cause to be paid the
         entire premium for each Title Policy at the Closing.

                  (b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Holdings, at
         its sole cost and expense, shall deliver to DFA and the Title Company
         an as-built survey for each parcel of real property used in the Dairy
         Operations (each, a "SURVEY") prepared by a registered land surveyor or
         engineer, licensed in the state in which the applicable parcel is
         located, dated on or after the date of this Agreement, certified to
         DFA, DFA's lender, DFA's counsel, the Title Company, and such other
         entities as DFA may designate in writing to Holdings, and in accordance
         with the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for




                                       13
<PAGE>   18

         ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys, jointly established and adopted by ALTA,
         ACSM and NSPS in 1999, and including such Table A Items as are
         reasonably required by DFA's lender or, if there is no such lender, as
         is customary (as reasonably agreed to by the parties) in the state in
         which the real property is located, and pursuant to the Accuracy
         Standards (as adopted by ALTA, NSPS and ACSM and in effect on the date
         of certification) such that the survey measurements are made in
         accordance with the Minimum Angle, Distance and Closure Requirements
         for Survey Measurements Which Control Land Boundaries for ALTA/ACSM
         Land Title Surveys, sufficient to cause the Title Company to delete the
         standard printed survey exception.

                  (c) If (i) any Commitment discloses a title exception other
         than a Permitted Encumbrance (an "UNPERMITTED ENCUMBRANCE") or (ii) any
         Survey discloses any encroachment, overlap, boundary dispute, gap or
         any other matter which renders title to any parcel of real property
         used in the Dairy Operations unmarketable (or defeasible, as the case
         may be, depending on the state in which the property is located) or
         reflects that any utility service to the improvements or access thereto
         from the public right-of-way does not lie wholly within any such
         parcel, or within an easement for the benefit of any such parcel, or
         reflects any other matter adversely affecting the present use or value
         (as either are reasonably agreed to by the parties) of any such parcel
         (any of the foregoing, a "SURVEY DEFECT"), then Holdings, at its sole
         cost and expense, prior to the Closing, shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to cause all Unpermitted Encumbrances to be removed from the
         applicable Commitment(s) and/or all Survey Defects eliminated or, if
         not reasonably practicable to be removed or eliminated, insured over by
         an appropriate title insurance endorsement, all in a manner reasonably
         satisfactory to DFA.

                  (d) If, due to an Unpermitted Encumbrance or Survey Defect,
         the present use or value of the real property is adversely affected (as
         either are reasonably determined by the parties), Suiza and SDG shall
         indemnify DFA in accordance with Section 9 hereof against Damages (as
         defined in Section 9.2).

                  (e) The parties agree that required governmental notices will
         be supplemented as such parties learn the identity and location of such
         properties. To the extent any real property is located in the State of
         Florida and as required by applicable Florida statute, Holdings hereby
         discloses to DFA the following: Radon is a naturally occurring
         radioactive gas that, when it has accumulated in a building in
         sufficient quantities, may present health risks to persons who are
         exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed federal and state
         guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida. Additional
         information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from your
         county public health unit.

         6.12 TRANSFER TAXES. SDG will pay, or will cause to be paid, the
transfer taxes related to the transfer of the Dairy Operations.

shall survive for the longer of eighteen months from the Closing Date and the
applicable statute of limitation with respect thereto; and (c) with respect to
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 4.4 and 4.5(b) of
the Bill of Sale, such representations and warranties and any claim for
indemnification with respect thereto shall survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any claim for indemnification that is asserted by written notice
as provided in






                                       17
<PAGE>   22

Section 9.2 within the applicable survival period shall survive until resolved
by the parties or pursuant to a final non-appealable judicial determination. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in the Bill of
Sale shall not be affected by any investigation, verification or examination by
any party hereto or by anyone on behalf of any such party. All covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, in the Bill of Sale or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the
parties hereto and shall survive the Closing until fully performed. Without
limiting the foregoing, the obligation of Suiza and SDG to indemnify DFA and its
Affiliates from and against the Excluded Liabilities, and the obligation of DFA
to indemnify Suiza and its Affiliates from and against the Dairy Liabilities,

(including incidental and consequential damages), expense (including costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees) or diminution of
value, whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively, "DAMAGES"),
arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:

                  (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
         Suiza, Holdings and SDG in this Agreement, or by Suiza and SDG in the
         Bill of Sale, or in any certificate delivered by Suiza, Holdings, SDG
         or Suiza Southeast pursuant to this Agreement or the Bill of Sale that
         survives the Closing in accordance with Section 9.1 or any allegation
         by a third party that, if true, would constitute such a breach;
         provided that any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
         subparagraph (a) is made within the time period specified in Section
         9.1 for the survival of the applicable representation or warranty that
         has been breached or is the subject of the third party claim; provided
         further, that for purposes of determining any such breach, any
         materiality qualifiers appearing in such representations and warranties
         will not be given effect;

                  (b) any Excluded Liability;

                  (c) any breach by Suiza, Holdings, SDG or Suiza Southeast or
         any of their Affiliates of any covenant or obligation of such Person in
         this Agreement or the Bill of Sale;

                  (c) any Unpermitted Encumbrances or Survey Defects, as

         such Person with Suiza, Holdings, SDG or Suiza Southeast (or any Person
         acting on their behalf) in connection with any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

respective directors, officers, employees and agents for, and will pay to such

connection with:

         in this Agreement or in the Bill of Sale or in any certificate
         delivered by any DFA Company pursuant to this Agreement or the Bill of
         Sale that survives the Closing in accordance with Section 9.1 or any
         allegation by a third party that, if true, would constitute such a
         breach; provided that any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
         subparagraph (a) is made within the time period specified in Section
         9.1 for the survival of the applicable representation or warranty that
         has been breached or is the subject of the third party claim; provided
         further, that for purposes of determining any such breach, any
         materiality qualifiers appearing in such representations and warranties
         will not be given effect;

                  (b) any Dairy Liability;

                  (c) any breach by any DFA Company of any covenant or
         obligation of such Person in this Agreement or the Bill of Sale; or

                  (d) any claim by any Person, including, without limitation,
         for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based
         upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any
         such Person with any DFA Company (or any Person acting on their behalf)
         in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.4. LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT.

                  (a) In determining the amount of Damages for which an
         indemnified person is entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2 or
         Section 9.3, any insurance proceeds or tax benefits that are realized
         or that could reasonably be expected to be realized by such indemnified
         person (if a claim were properly pursued under the relevant insurance
         arrangements or Legal Requirements), as well as any costs associated
         with obtaining such insurance proceeds or tax benefits, will be
         considered.

                  (b) DFA will be entitled to indemnification from Suiza and SDG
         under paragraph (a) of Section 9.2 only to the extent that the
         aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages incurred by DFA under such
         clause exceeds $1,000,000.

                  (c) Suiza and SDG will be entitled to indemnification from DFA
         under paragraph (a) of Section 9.3 only to the extent and in the amount
         that the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages incurred by Suiza
         and SDG under such clause exceeds $1,000,000.

                  (d) The maximum amount to which (i) DFA will be entitled to
         indemnification under paragraph (a) of Section 9.2, and (ii) Suiza and

                                       19
<PAGE>   24

         entitled to indemnification under paragraph (a) of Section 9.3, is
         limited to $10,000,000 for each such clause (i) and (ii) of this
         Section 9.4(d).

                  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth
         in Section 9.4(b), (c) and (d) will not apply to Damages arising from

         Section 6.11(d).

         9.5. PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION - THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

                  (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person under
         Section 9.2 or 9.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding
         against it, such Indemnified Person will, if a claim is to be made
         against an indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the
         indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure
         to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying
         party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person,
         except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the
         defense of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's
         failure to give such notice.

                  (b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 9.5(a) is brought
         against an Indemnified Person and it gives notice to the indemnifying
         party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party
         will, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party
         is also a party to such Proceeding and the Indemnified Person
         determines in good faith that joint representation would be
         inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide
         reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial
         capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with
         respect to such Proceeding), assume the defense of such Proceeding with
         counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and, after notice from
         the indemnifying party to the Indemnified Person of its election to
         assume the defense of such Proceeding and an acknowledgment of its
         indemnification obligation with respect thereto, the indemnifying party
         will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to
         the Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any fees of other
         counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
         Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
         Person in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than
         reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes
         the defense of a Proceeding in accordance with the preceding sentence,
         (i) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the
         indemnifying party without the Indemnified Person's consent unless (A)
         there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements
         or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other
         claims that may be made against the Indemnified Person, and (B) the
         sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
         indemnifying party and (ii) the Indemnified Person will have no
         liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
         effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying
         party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party
         does not, within ten days after the Indemnified




                                       20
<PAGE>   25

         Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its
         election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying
         party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any
         compromise or settlement reasonably effected by the Indemnified Person
         prior to notification by the indemnifying party, after such ten day
         period, if any, of its election to assume the defense thereof.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person
         determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
         Proceeding may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a
         result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to
         indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by
         notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend,
         compromise, or settle such Proceeding (at the expense of the
         indemnifying party), but the indemnifying party will not be bound by
         any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or
         settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
         withheld).

         9.6. PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION - OTHER CLAIMS. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted
by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

         9.7. MITIGATION. Upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable under
this Section 9, the Indemnified Person shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate
such Damages.

         9.8. EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The parties acknowledge and agree that, upon and
following the Closing, the indemnification rights provided in this Section 9
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the parties for any claim or
cause of action arising out of any breach of this Agreement and the Bill of
Sale.

                                   SECTION 10

                                   TERMINATION

         10.1. TERMINATION EVENTS. This Agreement may, by notice given prior to
or at the Closing, be terminated:

                  (a) by Holdings if satisfaction of a condition in Section 7
         has not been fulfilled prior to the Termination Date (other than
         through the failure of any of Suiza, Holdings, SDG or Suiza Southeast
         to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and Holdings has
         not waived such condition on or before the Termination Date or (ii) by
         DFA, if satisfaction of a condition in Section 8 has not been fulfilled
         prior to the Termination Date (other than through the failure of any
         DFA Company to comply with its respective obligations under this
         Agreement) and DFA has not waived such condition on or before the
         Termination Date;

                  (b) by mutual consent of Holdings and DFA; or

                  (c) by either Holdings or DFA if the Closing has not occurred
         (other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this
         Agreement or its affiliates to





                                       21
<PAGE>   26

         comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before
         the termination date identified in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
         between Suiza and Dean Foods dated as of April 4, 2001 as amended, (the
         "TERMINATION DATE") or such later date as the parties may agree upon.

         10.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Each party's right of termination under
Section 10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement
or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election
of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate and no
party will have any liability or obligation (for reimbursement of expenses or
otherwise) to any other party, except that the obligations in Sections 5.5 and
6.8 will survive and except that each party will remain liable to the other
parties for any breach of this Agreement by such party occurring prior to such
termination and all legal remedies of the other parties in respect of any such
breach will survive such termination unimpaired.

                                   SECTION 11

                                OTHER AGREEMENTS

         11.1. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. As soon as practicable after the date of
hereof, Holdings and DFA will reach an agreement concerning the specific terms
and conditions under which, and to the extent, the employees of the Dairy
Operations will be transferred to DFA at the Closing (including employee benefit
plan matters), which terms will be reasonable and customary for transactions
contemplated hereby.

         11.2. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2(b), effective
         as of the Closing, (a) the Limited Partnership Agreement shall be
         terminated and no party thereto shall have any continuing liability or
         obligation thereunder, and (b) each party hereby fully and completely
         releases and forever discharges each other and all other parties to the
         Limited Partnership Agreement, and the officers, directors, agents,
         successors and assigns of such parties from any liability, obligation
         or claim under the Limited Partnership Agreement, whether known or
         unknown and whether arising in contract or in tort.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of sections
         4.4(b), 4.4(c), 7.10, 7.11 and articles V, VI, IX, X and, to the extent
         applicable in interpreting and enforcing the foregoing provisions,
         article XIV of the Limited Partnership Agreement shall survive the
         Closing in accordance with their respective terms, for the sole purpose
         of indemnification and determining profit and loss and related taxes
         and allocations for the period from and including January 1, 2001
         through the Closing.

         11.3 WARN ACT. SDG shall comply, or shall cause the applicable
Affiliate of SDG to comply, with all requirements of the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, as amended, with respect to the sale of the Dairy
Assets and shall make all required disclosure and





                                       22
<PAGE>   27

         give all required notices thereunder to Governmental Bodies and the
         affected employees who are employed on the day of and immediately prior
         to the Closing Date.

                                   SECTION 12

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         12.1. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Holdings, DFA and Mid-Am agree to consult with each other in issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none of the parties to this
Agreement will issue any press release or make any public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by Legal Requirements.

         Telecopy: (214) 303-3851
</TABLE>

         12.3. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS. In the event of a breach by any party
to this Agreement and commencement of a subsequent legal action in a court of
law or forum of arbitration, or in the event legal counsel is consulted in the
event of any such breach or in anticipation of any such prospective legal
action, the prevailing party in any such dispute shall be entitled to
reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses.

         12.4. FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request
to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and





                                       23
<PAGE>   28

(c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other party may reasonably
request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the
documents referred to in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
following the Closing, Suiza and its Affiliates will refer to DFA as promptly as
practicable any telephone calls, letters, orders, notices, requests, inquiries
and other communications relating to the Dairy Operations, and otherwise assist
DFA in good faith in the orderly transfer of the Dairy Operations to DFA.

         12.5. WAIVER. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement
are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged
by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or
right unless in a writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be
given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it
is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such
notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

         12.6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement, including
the Bill of Sale and the Note) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms
of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party
to be charged with the amendment.

         12.7. ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS AND NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. No party may
assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other parties; provided, that DFA shall be entitled to assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of DFA without the consent of
any other party hereto; provided, however, that DFA shall in all events remain
liable hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply
to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors
and permitted assigns of the parties. Except as set forth in Section 12.8,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 9, this Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

         12.8. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder,
including its failure to take all required actions on its part necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause irreparable injury
to the other parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of
injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance
of such party's




                                       24
<PAGE>   29

obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder.

         12.9. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

         12.10. SECTION HEADINGS, CONSTRUCTION. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction
or interpretation. All references to "SECTION" or "SECTIONS" refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances
require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not
limit the preceding words or terms.

         12.11. TIME OF ESSENCE. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

         12.12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE-OF-LAW RULES THAT
MAY REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

         12.13. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

         12.14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Except with respect to the matters set forth
in Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(d), which will be resolved as provided in such
Section, if any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the other
documents to be delivered hereunder (including under the Bill of Sale), the
parties agree not to commence any lawsuit with respect to such dispute until the
following procedures have been completed:

                  (a) The party believing a dispute to exist will give the other
         parties written notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the
         facts alleged to give rise to such dispute, the relevant contractual
         provisions, the nature of any claimed default or breach and a statement
         of the manner in which such party believes the dispute should be
         resolved.

                  (b) Within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, each
         party against whom relief is sought in connection with such dispute
         will deliver a written response, setting forth in reasonable detail its
         view of the facts alleged to give rise to such dispute, the relevant
         contractual provisions, the nature of the claimed default or breach and
         a statement of the manner in which such party believes the dispute
         should be resolved.

                  (c) If the parties do not agree on the manner in which the
         dispute should be resolved, they will arrange to hold a meeting within
         ten (10) days after delivery of the





                                       25
<PAGE>   30

         response. Each party will have in attendance at such meeting a
         representative with authority to bind the represented party to any
         agreement resolving the dispute. At the meeting (and any adjournments
         thereof), the parties will negotiate in good faith in an attempt to
         agree as to whether a dispute exists, the exact nature of the dispute
         and the manner in which the dispute should be resolved. If deemed
         appropriate by the parties, a professional mediator may be engaged to
         assist in resolving the dispute. Any resolution of the dispute will be
         evidenced by a written agreement setting forth in reasonable detail the
         actions to be taken by each party. If no such written agreement is
         reached within twenty (20) days after the first meeting, the parties
         may pursue any legal remedies available to them with respect to such
         dispute.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to
         prevent irreparable harm, either party may commence an action in a
         court of competent jurisdiction seeking a temporary restraining order,
         preliminary injunction or other injunctive relief without complying
         with the foregoing dispute resolution procedures.
