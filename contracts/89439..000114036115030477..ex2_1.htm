AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of August 5, 2015,
among Tecumseh Products Company, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"), MA
Industrial JV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), and MA
Industrial Sub Inc., a Michigan corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Sub").

  


 

  

WITNESSETH:

  


 

  

A. WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Sub has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time
to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire all of the
outstanding Common Shares, no par value, of the Company (the "Shares"), for
$5.00 per Share net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (such
amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the
"Offer Price");

  


 

  

B. WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (the "Merger") with the Company as the surviving corporation in
accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of Michigan (the
"MBCA"), whereby each Share, except as otherwise provided herein, will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without
interest, except for Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.02(b);

  


 

  

C. WHEREAS, the board of directors (the "Board of Directors") of the Company
has unanimously determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, has adopted
and approved this Agreement and the Transactions and has resolved to recommend
that the shareholders of the Company tender their shares to Sub pursuant to,
and accept, the Offer, and, if necessary under applicable Laws, adopt and
approve this Agreement and thereby approve the Merger;

  


 

  

D. WHEREAS, the members of Parent have unanimously determined that, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, this Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its members,
has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, adopted and
approved this Agreement and the Transactions and has resolved to recommend
that Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, adopt and approve this Agreement
and thereby approve the Merger;

  


 

  

E. WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Sub has unanimously determined that, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, this Agreement and
the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of Sub and its sole
shareholder, has adopted and approved this Agreement and the Transactions and
has resolved to recommend that Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, adopt
and approve this Agreement and thereby approve the Merger; and

  


 

  

F. WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, each of Mueller Industries, Inc., Atlas Capital Resources II LP and
Atlas Capital Resources (P) II LP (the "Guarantors") is providing a guarantee
to the Company (collectively, the "Guarantee") pursuant to which the
Guarantors are guaranteeing the full and timely payment and performance of
Parent's and Sub's duties and obligations under this Agreement substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  

  

 

\- 1 -  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I.

  

THE OFFER

  


 

  

Section 1.01 The Offer.

  


 

  

(a) Parent shall not, and shall cause Sub not to, commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2(a) of the 1934 Act) the Offer prior to the date that is 14 days
after the date hereof. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, Parent shall cause Sub to, and
Sub shall, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the 1934 Act) the
Offer as promptly as practicable after such date (but in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days following such date or such later date as the parties
may mutually agree in writing). The Sub shall be obligated to accept for
payment and to, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the 1934 Act (relating to Sub's
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination
or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with this Agreement), subject to the condition that there shall be
validly tendered (excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee) in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the
expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of Shares that,
together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates,
represents at least a majority of the total number of Shares then outstanding
on a Fully Diluted Basis (the "Minimum Condition") and to the other conditions
set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer
Conditions") and to no other conditions. Subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver (except for the Minimum Condition) of the Offer Conditions, promptly
after the later of (i) the earliest date as of which Sub is permitted under
applicable Law to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and
(ii) the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions has been
satisfied, or waived by Parent or Sub, Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Sub
to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment
each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
and promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer pay the Offer Price (without interest) in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c)
of the 1934 Act for each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of Sub (and of Parent to cause Sub) to
accept for payment, and pay the Offer Price (without interest) for, each Share
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to the satisfaction, or waiver (except for the Minimum Condition)
by Parent or Sub, of each of the Offer Conditions. The Company agrees that no
Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

(b) Sub expressly reserves the right to waive (except for the Minimum
Condition) any of the Offer Conditions and to make any other changes in the
terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent may be granted or withheld by the
Company in its sole discretion) (i) no change may be made that changes the
form of consideration to be paid, or decreases the Offer Price or the number
of Shares sought in the Offer, (ii) no change may be made that amends or adds
to the Offer Conditions or amends any other term of the Offer, in each case in
any manner that is adverse to the shareholders of the Company, and except for
any change or amendment that is required by Law or any waiver of any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Condition), (iii) the expiration date shall
not be extended except as otherwise provided herein, and (iv) Sub shall not
terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01.

  

  


 

  

 

\- 2 -  

  

(c) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially
expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time on the date (the "Initial
Expiration Time") that is twenty (20) Business Days after the commencement of
the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
1934 Act). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Sub shall (or at the request of
the Company, Parent shall cause Sub to) extend the Offer, if at the Initial
Expiration Time or any extension thereof the Offer Conditions shall not have
been satisfied (other than conditions which by their nature are to be
satisfied on the Acceptance Date) or waived (except for the Minimum
Condition), for successive extension periods of not more than ten (10)
Business Days each (except as required by Law) in order to permit the
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and (ii) Sub shall extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law or by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the
staff thereof or the Nasdaq Global Market applicable to the Offer; provided
that in no event shall Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the End
Date. Following expiration of the Offer, Sub may, in its sole discretion,
provide a subsequent offering period ("Subsequent Offering Period") in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act if, as of the expiration of the
Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived, but there
shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
that number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a
meeting of the Company's shareholders in accordance with the MBCA. Subject to
the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
it to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer, including any Subsequent Offering Period, all Shares
(i) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (ii) validly
tendered in the Subsequent Offering Period (the date on which Shares are first
accepted for payment, the "Acceptance Date"). The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to
reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof in
accordance with Section 2.07.

  


 

  

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall (i) file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the
Offer, which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and (ii)
to the extent required by applicable U.S. securities Laws, cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Each of Parent and Sub
agrees that it shall cause the Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents filed
by any of them with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the 1934
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of
Parent, Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent and Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law. The Company shall furnish or otherwise make available to
Parent and Sub and their legal counsel all information concerning the
Company's shareholders, including a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of the stockholders of the Company, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of all record and
beneficial holders of the Shares, and a list of security positions of Shares
held in stock depositories that Parent or Sub may reasonably request in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.01(d), including
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares;
provided that, except as required by Law or in connection with steps as are

(a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Sub for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at the Acceptance
Date, which Shares represent at least a majority of the issued and outstanding
Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis, and from time to time thereafter as Shares
are acquired by Parent or Sub pursuant to the Offer, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market, Parent shall be
entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole

total number of directors on the Company's Board of Directors (giving effect
to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and
(ii) the percentage that the number of Shares then beneficially owned by
Parent and its Affiliates (including such Shares accepted for payment) bears
to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall take all
action reasonably necessary to cause Parent's designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, including increasing the number
of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At
such time, the Company shall, upon Parent's request and to the extent

(and each committee thereof) that, in each case, represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Company's Board of Directors;

established to take action under this Agreement, such committee shall be
composed only of Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to Section 1.03(b) below, in connection with the election or
appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to this Section 1.03(a) and until
the Effective Time, the Company's Board of Directors shall at all times

date hereof or a person selected by the Continuing Directors then in office.
If the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to below two prior to the
Effective Time, any remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if
there shall be only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate a person to
fill such vacancy who is not an officer, director, stockholder or designee of
Parent or any of its Affiliates and who shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or, if no Continuing Directors
then remain, the other directors shall designate two persons to fill such

1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the
Company shall promptly (but no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
initial expiration date of the Offer) take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.03, including mailing to shareholders of the Company the information
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent's

information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1). Parent shall supply such
information to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

action of the Company's Board of Directors shall be required, to authorize (i)
any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any
agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,

and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, (iii) the taking of any action by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would prevent or would materially

Transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent permitted under applicable
Law, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or
appointed to the Company's Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time,
in addition to any requirements under the Company's articles of incorporation
and bylaws, any quorum of the Company's Board of Directors for the purposes of
any meeting thereof or transacting of business thereby with respect to the
approval of any of the foregoing actions shall be deemed to require the
presence of at least one (1) Continuing Director. The Continuing Directors
shall have the authority to retain one counsel and financial advisor of their
choice at the reasonable expense of the Company as determined appropriate by
the Continuing Directors for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations
hereunder and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Date, to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of

Section 1.04 Top-Up Option

  


 

  

(a) Subject to Section 1.04(b) and (c) the Company grants to Sub an
irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated
pursuant to the provisions hereof and exercisable only on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Top-Up Option"),
to purchase from the Company at a price equal to the Offer Price paid in the
Offer, the lowest number of authorized and unissued Shares that, when added to
the number of Shares, directly or indirectly, owned by Parent or Sub or their
Affiliates at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share
more than 90% of the Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all Shares to be issued upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option (the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
"Top-Up Shares").

  


 

  

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Sub in accordance with Section
1.04(c) only once, in whole, but not in part, at any time during the ten (10)
Business Day period following the Acceptance Date, or if any Subsequent
Offering Period is provided, during the 10 Business Day period following the
expiration date of such Subsequent Offering Period, and only if Sub shall own
as of such time less than 90% of the outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted
Basis; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent the
number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the
number of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares, (ii) unless
immediately following the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares
owned in the aggregate by Parent and Sub constitutes at least one Share more
than 90% of the Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all Shares to be issued upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option, (iii) unless the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied,
(iv) on or after the earlier of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (v) to the extent that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would require approval of the Company's
shareholders under Nasdaq Global Market Rule 4350, or (vi) if any applicable
Law shall be in effect that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Shares being purchased by Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Shares by the Offer Price,
without interest. Such purchase price shall be payable by Sub (A) in cash or
by wire transfer or cashier's check, (B) by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the purchase
price, or (C) any combination of the foregoing. Any such promissory note shall
bear interest at the rate of the prime lending rate prevailing from time to
time during such period as published in the Wall Street Journal, shall mature
on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty and shall have
no other material terms.

  

 

  

 

\- 7 -  

  

 

 

(c) In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the
Company at least two (2) Business Days' prior written notice (the "Top-Up
Notice") setting forth (i) the number of Shares, directly or indirectly, owned
by Parent and Sub at the time of such notice (giving effect to the acceptance
of Shares in the Offer), (ii) the number of Top-Up Shares that Sub intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (iii) the manner in which Sub
intends to pay the applicable purchase price. The Top-Up Notice shall also
include an undertaking signed by Parent and Sub that, as promptly as
practicable following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Sub intends to (and
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, as promptly as practicable after
such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with the MBCA as
contemplated by Section 8.05. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares, which shall take place at the location specified in Section 2.01(d),
Parent and Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Sub certificates representing the Top-Up Shares
or, at Parent's or Sub's request or otherwise if the Company does not then
have certificated Shares, the applicable number of non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry. The parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with
the MBCA as contemplated by Section 8.05 as close in time as practicable to
(including, to the extent practicable, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares.

  


 

  

(d) Parent and Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered
under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption
thereunder. Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Sub is,
and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be acquired by Sub
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the 1933 Act. Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends required by
applicable securities laws.

Sub or one of its Affiliates shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, at or

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, the

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Exchange Agent may

receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or book-entry
share, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Merger
Consideration payable for each Share formerly represented by a Certificate or
book-entry share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Certificate or book-entry share shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or book-entry share
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such

be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or book-entry share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  


 

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or book-entry

exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article II.

  

  


 

  

 

\- 10 -  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned

the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation or one of
its Affiliates upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such

(b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Company Proxy Statement (including each amendment or
supplement thereto) before it is filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide
Parent and Sub (in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and Sub
regarding, any comments (written or oral) the Company or its counsel may

counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and
oral comments and proposed responses. The Company and Parent shall each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC
with respect to all comments received on the Company Proxy Statement by the
SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Company Proxy Statement to be
mailed promptly after the SEC staff advises it that it has no further comments
thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Company Proxy Statement.
Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent (with respect to itself and
Sub) shall each, upon request of the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Company Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of

parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
Merger to become effective on the dates specified in Section 2.01(d) without a

advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to

4.11 and 4.15 and (b) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.03 shall comply with applicable Law and be conducted at Parent's
expense, at reasonable times during business hours upon reasonable advance
notice and in such manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to minimize such
interference. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company (i) to
permit any inspection or access, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third Persons or in violation of any Law or breach of any agreement
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into before the date of this
Agreement, (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) to permit invasive testing of any of the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' real property; provided that with respect to
clauses (i) or (ii), it being understood that the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts in
cooperating with Parent to establish an appropriate confidentiality procedure
or other work-around to provide Parent with sufficient access to information
which is practicable under the circumstances (including with respect to the
items disclosed or required to be disclosed in respect of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 4.10, 4.11 and 4.15),
including, but not limited to, using commercially reasonable efforts, if
requested by Parent, at no expense to the Company, to obtain any and all
consents of such third parties as shall be necessary to permit such
information to be disclosed to Parent and its representatives. In no event
shall the Company be required to supply pursuant to this Section 6.03 to
Parent, or Parent's representatives, any information relating to indications
of interest from, or discussions with, any other potential acquirers of the
Company, with respect to which Section 6.04 shall apply. All requests for
access to the offices or books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall be made to such Representatives of the Company as the Company shall
designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests
and all access permitted hereunder. All information disclosed by the Company
to Parent and its representatives pursuant hereto shall be kept confidential
consistent with the confidentiality provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (the "Confidentiality Agreement") dated March 5,
2015 between the Company and Parent.

(i) the Company may continue to furnish information (including non-public
information) to any Excluded Party relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Acquisition Proposal and to engage in

Date and prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company receives a bona fide,
unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal from any other Person or Persons and
the Company is in compliance with this Section 6.04 in all material respects,
(A) the Company and Company Representatives may contact such Person or Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such proposal is or

Company's Board of Directors (x) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors) that failing to take such action would breach its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, then the
Company may, prior to the Acceptance Date, subject to first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person, furnish information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to such Person or Persons that made such Acquisition Proposal;
and engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; provided that the Company shall (1) before furnishing information or
engaging in such discussions and negotiations (and in any event, within one
(1) Business Day of receipt thereof), notify Parent in writing of its
intention to take such actions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, and

take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board

or an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors has determined is or

(ii) approve and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (that the Company's Board of Directors has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal); provided that the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with the provisions of Section 6.04 and,
concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement, terminates this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.1(d)(ii) and pays the
Termination Fee in accordance with the provisions in Section 11.04(b);

Parent in writing at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking such
action(s) that the Board of Directors intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or the Board of
Directors has determined that the Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and intends to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and to terminate
this Agreement (such notice to Parent shall describe the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Persons
making such Superior Proposal, and shall be accompanied by a copy of a draft
of the definitive agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to such
Superior Proposal); (y) Parent does not make, prior to the expiration of such
three (3) Business Day period, an offer that the Board of Directors shall have
concluded in good faith (after considering the advice of its outside legal and
financial advisors) causes such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior
Proposal (it being understood that the Company shall not enter into any
agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal during such three (3) Business
Day period and, during such period, shall negotiate any counterproposal with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal); and (z) the Board of Directors has confirmed (after
taking into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) that the Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors) that failing to take such action would breach
its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law), it
being understood that during the notice period, if any material revisions are
made to the Superior Proposal, the Company will be required to provide a new
notice hereunder to comply with this Section 6.04(d);

  

  

 

\- 46 -  

  

(iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a material
development or change in circumstances relating to the business, results of
operations, assets or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is unknown and not reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors as of
the date hereof and which event or change in circumstance first occurs or
arises after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Date (such material
development or change in circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), if the Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors) that, as a result of such Intervening Event, the
failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, that the Company provides Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice of such Adverse Recommendation Change
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying the basis
therefor in reasonable detail.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) disclosing any position
contemplated by, or otherwise complying with, Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the 1934 Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (or any
similar communication to holders of Shares in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act (or any
similar communication to holders of Shares in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) if the Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law or (iii) taking any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take; provided any disclosure under clause (ii) above shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors
expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
communication or within two (2) Business Days after being requested to do so
by Parent.

  


 

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or
Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any (i) acquisition
of assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including outstanding
securities of Subsidiaries) representing 20% or more of the Company's
consolidated assets, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding equity
interests of the Company, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the
outstanding equity interests of the Company (whether in one transaction or in
a series of transactions and whether directly or indirectly) or (iv) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, joint
venture, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company, in each case, other than the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

 

\- 47 -  

  

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with all
percentages in subparagraphs in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
increased to 50%) that does not arise out of or result from any violation of
this Section 6.04 and that is on terms that the Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) is reasonably likely to be capable of consummation in
accordance with its terms, is more favorable to the Company's shareholders
than the Offer and the Merger (after giving effect to any subsequent offer
made by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal and taking into account
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal) and the
financing of which is fully committed or in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors is reasonably capable of being fully financed.

COVENANTS OF PARENT

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  


 

  

Section 7.01 Obligations of Sub.

  


 

  

Parent shall take all action necessary (a) to cause Sub to perform and comply
with its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, undertakings and
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that,

material inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees full performance and payment by Sub and the Surviving Corporation
of each of its covenants, obligations and undertakings pursuant to or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and hereby represents,
acknowledges and agrees that any breach of, or other failure to perform, any
such representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking
of Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall also be deemed to be a breach or
failure to perform by Parent, and the Company and any Indemnified Person shall
have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all
available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against any or all of Parent, Sub and the Surviving
Corporation in the first instance.

omissions or events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent (A) provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, as
applicable, (B) permitted by applicable Law, in each case as in effect on the

provisions regarding limitations on personal liability of directors and
indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, Indemnified Persons in
respect of matters, acts, omissions or events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the
corresponding provisions in the Company's and its Subsidiaries' articles of
incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents and in any
Indemnification Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided that if any claim is asserted against any individual
entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification, limitations on personal liability and

indemnification claims;

  


 

  

(iii) honor all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to each
Indemnified Person (including rights relating to advancement of expenses and

Person at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in respect of
matters, acts, omissions or events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
to the fullest extent provided in any indemnification agreements to which the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party as of the date hereof that
are listed on Section 7.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement;

  

  

 

\- 49 -

effect for six years after the Effective Time the Company's directors' and
officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof or (B)
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as those contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof, in each case covering matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six (6) year extended
reporting period endorsement with respect to the Company's DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof; and

complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law, the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any indemnification
agreement to which the Company is a party as of the date hereof, as the case
may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Indemnified Person.

  


 

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 7.03 shall impair any rights of any Indemnified
Person, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any
Indemnified Person who is or was an officer or director of the Company becomes
involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation covered by this Section 7.03 after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Person such
Indemnified Person's reasonable legal or other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith); provided
that such expenses shall only be advanced upon receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay the expenses, without interest,
if upon the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding it is
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

  

 

\- 50 -  

  

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 are intended
for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Person and

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit for all purposes for service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides such past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit
plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in which such employee
is eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility to participate,
entitlement to benefits, vesting and determination of level of benefits;
provided, that such credit shall not be provided (i) to the extent that such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) to the extent that such
credit was not recognized under the comparable Plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or if there was not comparable Plan
in place prior to the Effective Time, or (iii) with respect to benefit
accruals. With respect to each health or other welfare benefit plan maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, for the benefit of any Continuing Employees,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) cause to be waived
any waiting period requirements, insurability requirements and the application
of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent that
such requirements and limitations were satisfied or waived under a comparable
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) cause each Continuing
Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such
Continuing Employee under any similar Company Plan for the plan year in which
such participation commences for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments

in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or
of any failure of the party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause

expiration of the Offer.

  

  

 

\- 54 -  

  

Section 8.08 Takeover Statutes.

by applicable Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals

such litigation. The Company shall give Parent, at its sole expense, the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder

precedent to the receipt of the Equity Financing or imposes additional
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Equity Financing, (ii) adversely

ANNEX I

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to compliance
with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Sub shall not be required to
accept for payment, or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the 1934 Act (relating to Sub's
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination
or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, any Shares validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, if:

  


 

  

(a) Immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, there are any waiting
periods (including any extensions thereof) or any approvals or clearances
applicable to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger under any applicable
Antitrust Laws, including suspensory filing requirements, waiting periods and
required actions, consents that shall not have expired, or been terminated or
obtained, as applicable and that would make illegal the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger; or

  


 

  

(b) at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions exists and shall be
continuing (and not be waived):

  


 

  

(i) there is a Law or judgment, injunction, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction restraining, prohibiting or
otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

  


 

  

(ii) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 4.05(a) shall not be true and correct in all but de minimis respects
at and as of the time at which Sub first accepts any Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer as if made at and as of such time (it being agreed that
for purposes of Section 4.05(a), any inaccuracy in which the applicable
amounts as of a date of determination exceed the amounts set forth in Section
4.05(a) by no more than 0.1% shall be deemed de minimis), (B) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 4.01,
4.02, and 4.20 shall not be true and correct in all respects at and as of the
time at which Sub first accepts any Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer
as if made at and as of such time (other than representations and warranties
that by their terms address matters only as of another specified time, which
shall be true and correct only as of such time), or (C) the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
(disregarding all materiality and Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein) shall not be true and correct at and as of
the time at which Sub first accepts any Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than representations and
warranties that by their terms address matters only as of another specified
time, which shall be true and correct only as of such time) except where the
failure of such representations to be so true and correct does not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  


 

  

(iii) (A) the Company shall have failed to comply in all respects with all of
its obligations under Section 6.01(j)(ii)(B) or (B) the Company shall have
failed to perform in any material respect any of its other covenants to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement prior to such time,
which failure either (x) materially, adversely affects the ability of Parent
to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) adversely
affects, in any material or substantial respect, the Company's financial
condition or business;

  

  

 

A-1  

  

(iv) since the date of this Agreement, no Company Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred;

  


 

  

(v) Parent shall not have received a certificate executed by a duly authorized
officer of the Company dated as of the date of the Acceptance Date confirming
on behalf of the Company that the conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv) of paragraph (b) of this Annex I are duly satisfied immediately prior
to the Acceptance Date;

  


 

  

(vi) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
or

  


 

  

(vii) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may be
asserted by Parent or Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any
such conditions (except for circumstances caused by Parent's or Sub's failure
to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and may (other than the
Minimum Condition) be waived by Parent or Sub in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time in the sole discretion of either of them, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC.

  


 

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed.
