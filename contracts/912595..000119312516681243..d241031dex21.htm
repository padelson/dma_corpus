the nearest whole number of shares of MAA Common Stock and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares of MAA Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Post Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price of each share of Post Common Stock subject to such assumed
Post Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Incentive Plans and in each agreement evidencing any Post Options or any other
Post equity-based award, shall be deemed (i) for all purposes relating to
employment, consultancy or directorship (or words of similar meaning) to refer
to MAA and its Subsidiaries and (ii) for all other purposes, to refer to MAA.

Common Stock, evidence of book-entry shares of MAA Series I Preferred Stock,
and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"), in each case, for

Agent as directed by MAA. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of MAA. No investment of the Exchange
Fund shall relieve MAA or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required
by this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment,
MAA shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the
extent necessary to satisfy MAAs obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Post Common Stock and Post Series A Preferred Stock at

interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, or

of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, or, as applicable, the Preferred
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Preferred Book-Entry
Share, surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction
of MAA that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

Preferred Stock prior to the Parent Merger who have not theretofore complied

(f) No Liability. None of the MAA Parties, the Post Parties, the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any person in respect of the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, if the Exchange Fund has been
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of MAA, free
and clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Tax purposes), such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local
or foreign Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over

and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.7 _Structure_.

 

(a) Each Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate with and agree to any
reasonable changes requested by the other Parties regarding the structure of
the transactions contemplated herein, which cooperation shall include entering
into appropriate amendments to this Agreement, to reflect the change;
_provided_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or
kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Post Common Stock or
Post OP Units as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be
anticipated to impose any material impediment or delay, or condition to,
consummation of the Mergers, (iii) adversely affect, including with respect
to federal income tax treatment, any of the parties hereto or the holders of
Post Common Stock or Post OP Units in connection with the Mergers, (iv)
require submission to or approval by holders of Post Common Stock after the

the right, in its sole discretion, to cause the timing of the consummation of

Time will occur following the Parent Merger Effective Time).

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 3.7(a)_ , MAA shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to cause the structure of the Partnership
Merger to be changed from a direct merger of Post LP with and into MAA LP with

wholly-owned subsidiary of MAA LP with and into Post LP with Post LP
continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of MAA LP; _provided_ ,
that any such newly-formed subsidiary of MAA LP shall sign a joinder to this
Agreement.

 



19 Section 3.8 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of MAA Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of MAA. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Post Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Parent Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of MAA Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a share of MAA Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of MAA Common Stock.

 

Section 3.9 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate or Preferred Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or Preferred
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by MAA, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as MAA may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate or Preferred Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or Preferred
Certificate, as applicable, the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration and any distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

such Post Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force

Permits addressed in _Section 4.17_ or _Section 4.18_ ), except in each case

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later Post SEC
Documents filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement and provided that no representation or warranty is made hereunder as

with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange

events, changes and circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have a Post
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the
Post SEC Documents, as set forth in Section 4.9 of the Post Disclosure Letter
or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a Post Material
Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of Post or any of the Post
Subsidiaries of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth
on the financial statements of Post or the notes thereto, other than: (a)
liabilities adequately provided for on the balance sheet of Post dated as of
June 30, 2016 (including the notes thereto) as required by GAAP, (b)
liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (c) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, subsequent to June 30, 2016\.

 

Section 4.10 _No Default_. Except as set forth on Section 4.10 of the Post
Disclosure Letter, none of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries is in default
or violation (and to the Knowledge of Post, no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation)
of any term, condition or provision of (a) (i) the Post Articles of
Incorporation or the Post Bylaws, (ii) the articles of incorporation or bylaws
of Post GP, (iii) the Post LP Agreement or the certificate of limited
partnership of Post LP or (iv) the comparable charter or organizational
documents of any of the other Post Subsidiaries, (b) any loan or credit
agreement, note, or any bond, mortgage or indenture, to which Post or any of
the Post Subsidiaries is a party or by which Post, any of the Post
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is bound, or (c)
any Order, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Post or any of the Post
Subsidiaries, except in the case of (b) and (c) for defaults or violations
which have been cured or, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Post Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.11 _Litigation_. Except as individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Post Material Adverse Effect, or as set
forth in Section 4.11 of the Post Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this
Agreement, (a) there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Post,
threatened in writing by or before any Governmental Authority against Post or
any Post Subsidiary or any director or officer of Post or any Post Subsidiary,
and (b) neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary, nor any of Posts or any Post
Subsidiarys respective property, is subject to any outstanding Order of any
Governmental Authority.

 

Section 4.12 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Post and each Post Subsidiary has timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and
all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. Post
and each Post Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on
their behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required
to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax return. Neither Post nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received a written claim, or to the Knowledge of
Post, an unwritten claim, by any authority in a jurisdiction where any of
them does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction.

 

(b) Post and each Post REIT Subsidiary: (i) for all taxable years commencing
with the taxable year ending December 31, 1993 (and the relevant Post REIT
Subsidiarys formation) and through December 31, 2015,

 



26  has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the
meaning of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code (a "REIT") and has satisfied all
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for such years; (ii)
has operated since January 1, 2016 and will operate to the Parent Merger
Effective Time in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner
as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger (or
in the case of each Post REIT Subsidiary, intends to continue to operate up to
the Parent Merger in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable
year that will include the Parent Merger); and (iv) has not taken or omitted
to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
by the IRS to its status as a REIT, and to the Knowledge of Post, no such
challenge is pending or threatened. No entity in which Post owns an interest
is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a Post REIT
Subsidiary, a corporation that qualifies as a REIT, a "qualified REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code ("Qualified
REIT Subsidiary") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning
of Section 856(l) of the Code ("Taxable REIT Subsidiary"). Section 4.12(b) of
the Post Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each Post REIT Subsidiary,
Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary owned directly
or indirectly by Post, and each Post Subsidiary not set forth in Section
4.12(b) of the Post Disclosure Letter is and has been since its formation
classified as a partnership or entity disregarded as separate from Post or a
Post Subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Post Subsidiary
that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company and has not
elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity,
as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation. Taking into account all distributions to be made by Post prior to
the Parent Merger Effective Time, Post will have distributed cash to its
shareholders in its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger in an amount
equal to or in excess of the amount required to be distributed pursuant to
Section 857(a) of the Code in respect of its taxable year ending with the
Parent Merger, and Post will not be subject to Tax under Sections 857(b) or
4981 of the Code in respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger.

 

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the Knowledge of Post, threatened with
regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of Post or any Post Subsidiary; (ii) no
deficiency for Taxes of Post or any Post Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed
or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Post, threatened, by
any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except
for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect
to which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Post Material Adverse Effect; (iii) except
as set forth in Section 4.12(c)(iii) of the Post Disclosure Letter, neither
Post nor any Post Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with
respect to the assessment of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year or is the
beneficiary of an extension of time to file any Tax Return except for any such
waivers or extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income
Tax Return in respect of a taxable year or period ending in 2015 or 2016; and
(iv) except as set forth in Section 4.12(c)(iv) of the Post Disclosure Letter,
neither Post nor any of the Post Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d) Neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of
which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code.

(e) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012, (i) Post and the
Post Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes under
Sections 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A),
857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid and
shall not incur any such liability for such Taxes in the taxable year ending
on the Closing Date, and (ii) neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than (A) in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or
similar Taxes arising in connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer
of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Post or the Post Subsidiaries.

 



27 (f) Post and the Post Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under
any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each
case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all material
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date
thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Section 4.12(g) of the Post Disclosure Letter,
there are no Post Tax Protection Agreements in force at the date of this
Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no person has raised in
writing, or to the Knowledge of Post, threatened to raise a material claim
against Post or any Post Subsidiary for any breach of any Post Tax
Protection Agreements. As used herein, "Post Tax Protection Agreements" means
any written agreement to which Post or any Post Subsidiary is a party (i)
pursuant to which any liability to holders of interests in a Post
Subsidiary Partnership relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and/or (ii) that was entered into in connection with or related to the
deferral of income Taxes of a holder of interests in a Post Subsidiary
Partnership, and that requires Post or any Post Subsidiary (A) to maintain a
minimum level of debt, continue a particular debt, or provide rights to
guarantee or otherwise assume economic risk of loss with respect to debt, (B)
to retain or not to dispose of assets, or engage in transactions of comparable
tax effect, (C) to make or refrain from making a Tax election, and/or (D) only
dispose of assets in a particular manner. As used herein, "Post Subsidiary
Partnership" means a Post Subsidiary that is a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

 

(h) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Post or any Post
Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 

(i) Neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary has requested or has received any
written ruling of a Governmental Authority, or has entered into any written
agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes.

(j) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to which Post or any Post Subsidiary is a party (other than
customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings entered into
in the ordinary course of business and Post Tax Protection Agreements).

(k) Neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return or (ii)
has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Post or any Post
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

(l) Neither Post nor any Post Subsidiary has participated in any
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(m) Neither Post nor any of the Post Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(n) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(n) of the Post Disclosure Letter, no
written power of attorney that has been granted by Post or any of the Post
Subsidiaries (other than to Post or a Post Subsidiary) currently is in force
with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

 



28 (o) Neither Post nor any of the Post Subsidiaries (other than Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such
entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

 

(p) As of the date of this Agreement, Post is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Parent Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

(q) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(q) of the Post Disclosure Letter, to
the Knowledge of Post, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged at
any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section
857(b)(6) of the Code or engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, excess interest, and
redetermined TRS service income" described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

 

(r) This _Section 4.12_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Post Parties with respect to Taxes and Tax matters (other
than those matters described in _Section 4.7(c)_ , _Section 4.13_ , _Section
4.14(c)_ , _Section 4.18(b)_ and _Section 4.18(g)_ ).

 

Section 4.13 _Pension and Benefit Plans; Employees_.

 

(a) Section 4.13(a) of the Post Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of the
date hereof, of every material Employee Benefit Plan currently maintained or
contributed to (or with respect to which any obligation to contribute has been
undertaken) by Post or any of its ERISA Affiliates (such Employee Benefit
Plans, the "Post Employee Benefit Plans". Each such Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS regarding its
qualification thereunder that has not been revoked and, to the Knowledge of
Post, no event has occurred and no condition exists that is reasonably
expected to result in the revocation of any such determination or opinion
letter.

 

(b) With respect to each such Post Employee Benefit Plan, Post has provided,

(c) Each Post Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with
the requirements of applicable law, including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

and records of Post and any ERISA Affiliate, of all amounts that Post and any
ERISA Affiliate are required under the terms of the Post

Benefit Plans on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any amounts not yet
due) and the contribution requirements, on a prorated basis, for the current
year have been made or otherwise properly accrued on the books and records of
Post through the Closing Date.

 

(e) Neither Post, an ERISA Affiliate or any person appointed or otherwise
designated to act on behalf of Post, or an ERISA Affiliate, nor, to the
Knowledge of Post, any other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as
defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA,
respectively) has engaged in any transactions in connection with any Post
Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably expected to result in the imposition
of a material penalty or pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA, material damages
pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a material tax pursuant to Section
4975(a) of the Code.

(f) No material liability, claim, action, audit, investigation, governmental

Post Employee Benefit Plan provides for medical, life insurance or other
health or welfare benefits (other than under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6
of Title I of ERISA or other similar applicable Law, or a plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) to any current or future retiree or former
employee.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(h) of the Post Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (individually or together with the
occurrence of any other event): (i) entitle any employee, trustee, director or

in severance pay under any Post Employee Benefit Plan or Post employment
agreement upon any termination of employment on or after the date of this
Agreement; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding or result
in any payment of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount or
value of any payment to any employee, officer, trustee or director of Post or
any Post Subsidiary, or could limit the right to amend, merge or terminate any
Post Employee Benefit Plan or related trust; (iii) result in payments or
benefits under any Post Employee Benefit Plan or Post employment agreement
which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code; or (iv) result
in a requirement to pay any tax "gross up" or similar "make whole" payment to
any employee, director, consultant or other service provider of Post or any of
its ERISA Affiliates.

 

(i) The per share exercise price of each Post Option is no less than the fair
market value of a share of Post Common Stock on the date of grant of such
Post Option (and as of each later modification thereof within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code. Each Post Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated and maintained in operational and documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.
No payment to be made under any Post Employee Benefit Plan is, or to the

the Code.

overdue wages or compensation due, breach of any express or implied employment
contract, violation of any law or regulation governing employment or
the termination thereof, or any other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious
conduct on the part of Post of any of the Post Subsidiaries in connection with
the employment relationship that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Post Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each individual who renders service to Post or any Post Subsidiary who is
classified by Post or such Post Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the

facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility of
Post or any Post Subsidiary.

for consideration at the MAA Shareholder Meeting, and (iii) as of the date of
this Agreement, resolved to recommend that the shareholders of MAA vote in
favor of the approval of the Parent Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "MAA Recommendation") and to

(c) MAA LP has the requisite limited partnership power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

 



40  Agreement to which it is a party, including the Partnership Merger. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by MAA LP and the consummation by it
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary partnership action, and no other partnership
proceedings on the part of MAA LP are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to the
filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Tennessee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by MAA LP, and
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of MAA, Post, Post
GP and Post LP, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of MAA LP,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Shareholder Approval and the MAA Employee Waivers, require any consent or
approval (except as contemplated by _Section 5.5(b)_ ) under, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit or material increase in any cost or
obligation of MAA or any MAA Subsidiary under, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, acceleration or
cancellation (with or without notice or the lapse of time or both) of, or give
rise to any right of purchase, first offer or forced sale under or result in
the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of MAA or any MAA Subsidiary
pursuant to, any MAA Material Contract, except, as to clauses (i)(C), (ii) and
(iii), respectively, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of MAA and MAA LP
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of MAA and MAA LP will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) the filing with
the SEC of (A) the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary and definitive form
and the Form S-4, and declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4, and (B)

are qualified to do business, (iv) the filing of the certificate of merger
with respect to the Partnership Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Georgia and the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, (v)
such filings and approvals as may be required by any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" Laws, (vi) such filings as may be required in
connection with Transfer Taxes, and (vii) where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or

41 Section 5.6 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and clearances that
are the subject of _Section 5.17_ or _Section 5.18_ , which are addressed
solely in those Sections, MAA and each MAA Subsidiary is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, variances,
exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and clearances of any
Governmental Authority and accreditation and certification agencies, bodies or
other organizations, including building permits and certificates of occupancy,
necessary for MAA and each MAA Subsidiary to own, lease and, to the extent
applicable, operate its properties or to carry on its respective business
substantially as it is being conducted as of the date hereof (the "MAA
Permits"), except in each case as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect. All
such MAA Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force
and effect of, any of the MAA Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect. All
applications required to have been filed for the renewal of the MAA Permits
have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, and all other filings required to have been made with respect to
such MAA Permits have been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, except in each case for failures to file which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
MAA Material Adverse Effect. Neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary has received
any written claim or written notice nor has any Knowledge indicating that MAA
or any MAA Subsidiary is currently not in compliance with the terms of any
such MAA Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms
of any such MAA Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Since January 1, 2014, neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary has been in
conflict with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law applicable to MAA or
any MAA Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of MAA or any MAA
Subsidiary is bound (except for Laws addressed in _Section 5.16_ , _Section
5.17_ , or _Section 5.18_), or (ii) any MAA Permits (except for the MAA
Permits addressed in _Section 5.17_ or _Section 5.18_ ), except in each case
for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that have been cured or,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
MAA Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.7 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

(a) MAA has made available to Post (by public filing with or furnishing to
the SEC or otherwise) a true and complete copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed or furnished by
MAA with the SEC since January 1, 2014 (the "MAA SEC Documents"). Except for
matters relating to open comment letters with the SEC as set forth in Section
5.7 of the MAA Disclosure Letter, as of their respective dates, the MAA SEC
Documents (other than preliminary materials) complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
MAA SEC Documents and none of the MAA SEC Documents, at the time of filing or
being furnished (or effectiveness in the case of registration statements),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later MAA SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that
no representation or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement that
were not supplied by or on behalf of MAA or MAA LP. As of the date of this
Agreement and except as previously made available to Post, MAA does not have
any outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to the MAA
SEC Documents. Other than MAA LP, no MAA Subsidiary is required to file any
form or report with the SEC.

 

(b) MAA has made available to Post complete and correct copies of all written
correspondence between the SEC on one hand, and MAA, on the other hand, since
January 1, 2014. At all applicable times, MAA

 



42  and MAA LP have both complied in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any applicable rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time, and the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules of the NYSE.

included or incorporated by reference in the MAA SEC Documents, including the
related notes and schedules, complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance
with applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring adjustments, none of which are material), the consolidated financial
position of MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of their
respective dates and the consolidated statements of income and the
consolidated cash flows of MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries for the periods
presented therein, in each case, except to the extent such financial
statements have been modified or superseded by later MAA SEC Documents filed

Section 5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.8 of the MAA Disclosure Letter,
since June 30, 2016, MAA and each MAA Subsidiary has conducted its business in
all material respects in the ordinary course. Since June 30, 2016, there has
not been any MAA Material Adverse Effect or any effect, event, change or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects,
events, changes and circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have a MAA
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.9 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the
MAA SEC Documents, as set forth in Section 5.9 of the MAA Disclosure Letter
or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material
Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of MAA or any of the MAA Subsidiaries
of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be set forth on the
financial statements of MAA or the notes thereto, other than: (a) liabilities
adequately provided for on the balance sheet of MAA dated as of June 30, 2016
(including the notes thereto) as required by GAAP, (b) liabilities incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (c)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2016\.

 

Section 5.10 _No Default_. Except as set forth on Section 5.10 of the MAA
Disclosure Letter, none of MAA or any of the MAA Subsidiaries is in default
or violation (and to the Knowledge of MAA, no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation)
of any term, condition or provision of (a) (i) the MAA Charter or the MAA
Bylaws (ii), the MAA LP Agreement or the certificate of limited partnership of
MAA LP or (iii) the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of
the other MAA Subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note, or any
bond, mortgage or indenture, to which MAA or any of the MAA Subsidiaries is a
party or by which MAA, any of the MAA Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets is bound, or (C) any Order, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to MAA or any of the MAA Subsidiaries, except in the case of (B)
and (C) for defaults or violations which have been cured or, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a MAA
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.11 _Litigation_. Except as individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect, or as set
forth in Section 5.11 of the MAA Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this
Agreement, (a) there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of MAA,
threatened in writing by of before any Governmental Authority against MAA or
any MAA Subsidiary or any director or officer of MAA or any MAA Subsidiary,
and (b) neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary, nor any of MAAs or any MAA
Subsidiarys respective property, is subject to any outstanding Order of any
Governmental Authority.

 



43 Section 5.12 _Taxes_.

 

(a) MAA and each MAA Subsidiary has timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and
all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. MAA
and each MAA Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on
their behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required
to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. Neither MAA nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received a written claim, or to the Knowledge of
MAA, an unwritten claim, by any authority in a jurisdiction where any of them
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

 

(b) MAA: (i) for all taxable years commencing with the taxable year ending
December 31, 1994 and through December 31, 2015, has been subject to taxation
as REIT and has satisfied all requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2016 and will operate
to the Parent Merger Effective Time in a manner consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to
continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable
year that will include the date of Parent Merger (and currently intends to
operate in such manner thereafter); and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take
any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the
IRS to its status as a REIT, and to the Knowledge of MAA, no such challenge
is pending or threatened. No entity in which MAA owns an interest is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a REIT, a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary. Section 5.12(b) of the MAA Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of each Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary of MAA, and
each MAA Subsidiary not set forth in Section 5.12(b) of the MAA Disclosure
Letter is and has been since its formation classified as a partnership or
entity disregarded as separate from MAA or an entity in which MAA owns an
interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each MAA Subsidiary that is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company and has not elected
to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the
case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation.

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the Knowledge of MAA, threatened with regard
to any Taxes or Tax Returns of MAA or any MAA Subsidiary; (ii) no deficiency
for Taxes of MAA or any MAA Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed
in writing or, to the Knowledge of MAA, threatened, by any Governmental
Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except for such
deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect to which
the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect; (iii) except as set forth in
Section 5.12(c)(iii) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, neither MAA nor any MAA
Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Tax
assessment or deficiency for any open tax year or is the beneficiary of an
extension of time to file any Tax Return except for any such waivers
or extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income Tax
Return in respect of a taxable year or period ending in 2015 or 2016; and (iv)
except as set forth in Section 5.12(c)(iv) of the MAA Disclosure Letter,
neither MAA nor any of the MAA Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d) Neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of
which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code.

(e) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012, (i) MAA and the
MAA Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes under
Sections 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A),
857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid, and
shall not incur any such liability for such Taxes in the taxable year that
will include the Closing Date, and (ii) neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than (A) in the ordinary
course of business or 

 



44  consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer of property. No event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material
risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed
upon MAA or the MAA Subsidiaries.

 

(f) MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with
all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under
any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each
case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all material
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date
thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Section 5.12(g) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, there
are no MAA Tax Protection Agreements in force at the date of this Agreement,
and, as of the date of this Agreement, no person has raised in writing, or to
the Knowledge of MAA threatened to raise a material claim against MAA or any
MAA Subsidiary for any breach of any MAA Tax Protection Agreements. As used
herein, "MAA Tax Protection Agreements" means any written agreement to which
MAA or any MAA Subsidiary is a party (i) pursuant to which any liability to
holders of interests in a MAA Subsidiary Partnership relating to Taxes may
arise, whether or not as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and/or (ii) that was entered into in
connection with or related to the deferral of income Taxes of a holder of
interests in a MAA Subsidiary Partnership, and that requires MAA or any MAA
Subsidiary (A) to maintain a minimum level of debt, continue a particular
debt, or provide rights to guarantee or otherwise assume economic risk of loss
with respect to debt, (B) to retain or not to dispose of assets, or engage in
transactions of comparable tax effect, (C) to make or refrain from making a
Tax election, and/or (D) only dispose of assets in a particular manner. As
used herein, "MAA Subsidiary Partnership" means a MAA Subsidiary that is a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

(h) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of MAA or any MAA
Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 

(i) Neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary has requested or has received any
written ruling of a Governmental Authority, or has entered into any written
agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes.

(j) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to which MAA or any MAA Subsidiary is a party (other than
customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings entered into
in the ordinary course of business and MAA Tax Protection Agreements).

 

(k) Neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than MAA or any MAA Subsidiary)
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

(l) Neither MAA nor any MAA Subsidiary has participated in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(m) Neither MAA nor any of the MAA Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



45 (n) Except as set forth in Section 5.12(n) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, no
written power of attorney that has been granted by MAA or any of the MAA
Subsidiaries (other than to MAA or a MAA Subsidiary) currently is in force
with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

 

(o) Neither MAA nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such
entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

(p) As of the date of this Agreement, MAA is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Parent Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

(q) Except as set forth in Section 5.12(q) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, to
the Knowledge of MAA, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged at
any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section
857(b)(6) of the Code or engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, excess interest, and
redetermined TRS service income" described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

(r) This _Section 5.12_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the MAA Parties with respect to Taxes and Tax matters (other
than those matters described in _Section 5.7(c)_ , _Section 5.13_ , _Section
5.14(c)_,  _Section 5.18(b)_ and _Section 5.18(g)_ ).

Section 5.13 _Pension and Benefit Plans; Employees_.

 

(a) Section 5.13(a) of the MAA Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of the
date hereof, of every material Employee Benefit Plan currently maintained or
contributed to (or with respect to which any obligation to contribute has been
undertaken) by MAA or any of its ERISA Affiliates (such Employee Benefit
Plans, the "MAA Employee Benefit Plans"). Each such MAA Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS regarding its
qualification thereunder that has not been revoked and, to the Knowledge of
MAA, no event has occurred and no condition exists that is reasonably expected
to result in the revocation of any such determination or opinion letter.

 

(b) With respect to each MAA Employee Benefit Plan, MAA has provided, or made
available, to Post (if applicable to such MAA Employee Benefit Plan): (i) all
documents embodying or governing such MAA Employee Benefit Plan, and any
funding medium for the MAA Employee Benefit Plan (including, without
limitation, trust agreements); (ii) the most recent IRS determination
or opinion letter with respect to such MAA Employee Benefit Plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code; (iii) the most recently filed IRS Form 5500 Annual
Report and accompanying schedules and audited financial statements; (iv) the
most recent actuarial report; (v) the current summary plan description for
such MAA Employee Benefit Plan (or other descriptions of such MAA Employee

modifications thereto; (vi) any insurance policy related to such MAA Employee
Benefit Plan; and (vii) all material written correspondence received from the
IRS, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the U.S. Department of Labor
during the past three (3) years relating to any government investigation or
audit or any submissions under any voluntary compliance or correction policy.

 

(c) Each MAA Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with
the requirements of applicable law, including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a MAA Material Adverse Effect and is being administered and

Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is a multiemployer
plan, within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37), is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA) or is a "multiple
employer plan" (as defined in Section 413 of the Code). Neither MAA nor any
ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or contributed to, or had any obligation
to contribute to (or borne any liability with respect to) any such
multiemployer plan or multiple employer plan.

 



46 (d) Full payment has been made, or otherwise properly accrued on the books and
records of MAA and any ERISA Affiliate, of all amounts that MAA and any ERISA
Affiliate are required under the terms of the MAA Employee Benefit Plans to
have paid as contributions to such MAA Employee Benefit Plans on or prior to
the date hereof (excluding any amounts not yet due) and the contribution
requirements, on a prorated basis, for the current year have been made or
otherwise properly accrued on the books and records of MAA through the Closing
Date.

 

(e) Neither MAA, an ERISA Affiliate or any person appointed or otherwise
designated to act on behalf of MAA, or an ERISA Affiliate, nor, to the
Knowledge of MAA, any other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as
defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA,
respectively) has engaged in any transactions in connection with any MAA
Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably expected to result in the imposition
of a material penalty pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA, material damages
pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a material tax pursuant to Section
4975(a) of the Code.

(f) No material liability, claim, action, audit, investigation,
governmental proceeding or litigation has been made, commenced or, to the
Knowledge of MAA, threatened with respect to any MAA Employee Benefit Plan
(other than for benefits payable in the ordinary course of business).

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 5.13(g) of the MAA Disclosure Letter, no
MAA Employee Benefit Plan provides for medical, life insurance or other
health or welfare benefits (other than under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6
of Title I of ERISA or other similar applicable Law, or a plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) to any current or future retiree or former
employee.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 5.13(h) of the MAA Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (after giving effect to any waivers
executed in connection with this Agreement) individually or together with the
occurrence of any other event: (i) entitle any employee, trustee, director or
consultant of MAA or the MAA Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay under any MAA Employee Benefit Plan or MAA employment agreement
upon any termination of employment on or after the date of this Agreement;
(ii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding or result in any
payment of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount or value of
any payment to any employee, officer, trustee or director of MAA or any
MAA Subsidiary, or could limit the right to amend, merge or terminate any MAA
Employee Benefit Plan or related trust; (iii) result in payments or benefits
under any MAA Employee Benefit Plan or MAA employment agreement which would
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code; or (iv) result in a
requirement to pay any tax "gross up" or similar "make whole" payment to any
employee, director, consultant or other service provider of MAA or any of
its ERISA Affiliates.

(i) The per share exercise price of each MAA Option is no less than the fair
market value of a share of MAA Common Stock on the date of grant of such MAA
Option (and as of each later modification thereof within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code. Each MAA Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated and maintained in operational and documentary

(iii) MAA shall prepare and cause to be submitted to the NYSE the application
and other agreements and documentation necessary for the listing of the MAA
Common Stock and MAA Series I Preferred Stock issuable in the Parent Merger on
the NYSE. Each of Post and MAA shall use its reasonable best efforts to (w)
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (x) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or
Securities Act, (y) mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its
respective shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective and (z) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as
necessary to complete the Mergers. MAA shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the application for the listing of the MAA Common Stock and the MAA
Series I Preferred Stock accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable
following submission. Each of Post and MAA shall furnish all information as
may be reasonably requested concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders
of its capital stock to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement and the preparation
and filing of the NYSE listing application. The Form S-4, the Joint Proxy
Statement and the NYSE listing application shall include all information
reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein. Each of Post
and MAA shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the NYSE or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement or from the NYSE for amendments or
supplements to the NYSE listing application, and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC or
the NYSE, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC or to the NYSE
listing application from the NYSE and advise the other Party of any oral
comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC or to the NYSE listing application from the NYSE. Each of Post
and MAA shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, and MAA shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form
S-4 and to any comments from the NYSE with respect to the NYSE listing
application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (x) filing the Form S-4
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, or (y) submitting the NYSE listing application to
the NYSE or responding to any comments of the NYSE with respect thereto, each
of Post and MAA shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed
final version of such document or response) and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other Party or its
counsel and, with respect to clause (x) above, each of Post and MAA also
shall have consented to the filing and mailing contemplated therein (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). MAA shall
advise Post, promptly after it receives notice thereof, (A) of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the MAA Common Stock and MAA Series
I Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Parent Merger for offering
or sale in any

 



62  jurisdiction, and MAA shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated and (B) of
the time the NYSE listing application is accepted. MAA shall take any other
action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, NYSE
rules and regulations, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the MAA Common Stock and the MAA Series I Preferred Stock in the
Parent Merger, and Post shall furnish all information concerning Post and the
holders of the Post Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such actions. MAA shall also take any other action required to be
taken under the Securities Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or
"blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with
the issuance of the New MAA OP Units in the Partnership Merger, and Post shall
furnish all information concerning Post, Post LP and the holders of the Post
OP Units as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Post Shareholder Approval or
the MAA Shareholder Approval, any information relating to Post or MAA, or any
of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by Post or MAA which, in
the reasonable judgment of Post or MAA, should be set forth in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties hereto, and Post and MAA shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law,
in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
shareholders of Post and the shareholders of MAA. For purposes of _Section
4.15_ , _Section 5.15_ and this  _Section 7.1_ , any information concerning
or related to Post, its Affiliates or the Post Shareholder Meeting will be
deemed to have been provided by Post, and any information concerning or
related to MAA, its Affiliates or the MAA Shareholder Meeting will be deemed
to have been provided by MAA. Nothing in this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any Party under _Section 7.1(a)_.

 

(c) Subject to the exercise of Posts rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal under _Section 7.4_ , Post shall, in accordance in all material
respects with applicable Law and the Post Articles of Incorporation and Post
Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Post Shareholder Meeting. Post shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of Post
entitled to vote at the Post Shareholder Meeting and, subject to the exercise
of Posts rights with respect to a Superior Proposal under _Section 7.4_ ,
to hold the Post Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act; _provided_ that in no
event shall Post be required to hold the Post Shareholder Meeting prior to the
thirty-fifth (35th) day following the date hereof. Post shall, through the
Post Board, recommend to its shareholders that they vote in favor of the
Parent Merger, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Post Shareholder
Approval, except to the extent that the Post Board shall have made a Change in
Post Recommendation as permitted by _Section 7.4(b)_ and subject to the
exercise of Posts rights with respect to a Superior Proposal under _Section
7.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_ , Post
shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Post Shareholder Meeting (i) for the absence of a quorum,
(ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Post Board has determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel is reasonably necessary under
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by Posts shareholders prior to the Post Shareholder Meeting, (iii)
to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the
extent Post reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Post
Shareholder Approval or (iv) if otherwise reasonably required by applicable
Law or if the directors of Post have determined in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) Subject to the exercise of MAAs rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal under _Section 7.4_ , MAA shall, in accordance in all material
respects with applicable Law and the MAA Charter and MAA Bylaws, 

 



63  establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the

the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of MAA entitled to
vote at the MAA Shareholder Meeting and, subject to the exercise of MAAs
rights with respect to a Superior Proposal under _Section 7.4_ , to hold the
MAA Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act; _provided_ that in no event shall MAA be
required to hold the MAA Shareholder Meeting prior to the thirty-fifth (35th)
day following the date hereof. MAA shall, through the MAA Board, recommend to
its shareholders that they vote in favor of the Parent Merger, include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the MAA Shareholder Approval, except to the
extent that the MAA Board shall have made a Change in MAA Recommendation as
permitted by _Section 7.4(b)_ and subject to the exercise of MAAs rights with
respect to a Superior Proposal under _Section 7.4_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1_ (d), MAA shall have the right to
make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the MAA
Shareholder Meeting (i) for the absence of a quorum, (ii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the MAA Board has determined in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel is reasonably necessary under Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by MAAs
shareholders prior to the MAA Shareholder Meeting, (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent MAA reasonably
believes necessary in order to obtain the MAA Shareholder Approval or (iv) if
otherwise reasonably required by applicable Law or if the directors of MAA
have determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(e) Subject to the exercise of Posts or MAAs rights with respect to a
Superior Proposal under  _Section 7.4_ , Post and MAA will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to hold the Post Shareholder Meeting and
the MAA Shareholder Meeting on the same date and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ that in no event
shall Post or MAA be required to hold the Post Shareholder Meeting or MAA
Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, prior to the thirty-fifth (35th) day
following the date hereof.

 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and subject to reasonable restrictions described in writing
imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel, each of Post and MAA shall,
and shall cause each of the Post Subsidiaries and the MAA Subsidiaries,
respectively, to, afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such
other Party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
each of Post and MAA shall, and shall cause each of the Post Subsidiaries and
the MAA Subsidiaries, respectively, to, (i) furnish reasonably promptly to the
other Party a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of U.S.
federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) furnish, upon reasonable request,
all other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request. No
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of information provided pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_ is made and the Parties may not rely on the accuracy of
such information except to the extent expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties included in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ , and
no investigation under this _Section 7.2_ or otherwise shall affect any of the
representations and warranties of the Post Parties or of the MAA Parties,
respectively, contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations
of the Parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Post nor MAA shall be required by this _Section 7.2_ to provide the
other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (if Post or MAA, as applicable, has
used reasonable best efforts to obtain permission or consent of such third
party to such disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law
or legal or contractual duty of the Party or any of its Representatives, (C)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the disclosing
Party or (D) if it reasonably

 



64  determines that such access is reasonably likely to disrupt materially or
impair or interfere with its, or its Subsidiaries, business or operations;
_provided_ that the Parties will work in good faith to determine a means to
provide access that will not disrupt materially or impair or interfere with
such business or operations. Each of Post and MAA will use its reasonable best
efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that
may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior
to the Parent Merger Effective Time, each of the Post Parties and each of the
MAA Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives and
Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise communicate with parties with which
the other Party has a business relationship (including tenants/subtenants)
regarding the business of such other Party or this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of such
other Party ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict a Party and its
respective Representatives and Affiliates from contacting such parties in
pursuing its own business activities (operating in the ordinary course)).

 

(b) Each of Post and MAA will hold, and will cause its respective
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , in confidence in
accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the termination thereof.

(c) Each of Post and MAA will give prompt written notice to the other upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of the Post Subsidiaries or the MAA
Subsidiaries, respectively, which could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Post Material Adverse Effect or a MAA
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 

(d) Each Party shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by the
other Party from time to time, in efforts to oversee the integration of the
Parties operations in connection with, and taking effect upon consummation
of, the Mergers subject to applicable Law, including, without limitation,
providing such reports on operational matters and participating on such teams
and committees as the Parties shall mutually agree.

Section 7.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance
with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do
promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate with each
other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents necessary to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with the
other Party in determining which filings are required to be made prior to the
Closing with, and which consents, clearances, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and in timely making all such filings, (ii) promptly
furnish the other Party, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate
confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and
consultants, with such information and reasonable assistance as such other
Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registrations and submissions of information
to any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to the extent necessary any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any applicable Laws by
any Governmental Authority, and (iv) take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain applicable clearances,
consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers and cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods with respect to the Mergers
under any applicable Laws as promptly as practicable and, in any event, no
later than the Outside Date.

 



65 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.3(a)_ ,
use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) promptly notify the other Party of any
communication concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any Governmental Authority and
consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep the other Party
reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other with copies of
any written notices or other communications received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, any U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except that any materials concerning one Partys valuation of the other Party
may be redacted; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in draft any
proposed written communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental
Authority with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with
each other in advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Governmental Authority or Person, not agree to participate in any meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority relating to any filings or
investigations concerning this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party and
its Representatives in advance and invites the other Partys Representatives
to attend in accordance with applicable Laws. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate competitively sensitive information
provided to the other under this _Section 7.3_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the Party providing such materials.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall (i)
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Laws, including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to
have any stay, temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered
by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed), and (ii)
take, or cause to be taken, all such further reasonable actions as may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority or
any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this  _Section 7.3_ shall limit a Partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ so long as such Party has,
prior to such termination, been complying with its obligations under this
_Section 7.3_.

 

(d) Each of MAA and Post shall, if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers, or any other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, grant approvals and use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Each of Post and MAA agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or
employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer by or with a Third Party with
respect to (A) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction

 



66  involving it which would result in any Person beneficially owning more than
twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding voting securities of Post, Post LP,
MAA or MAA LP, as the case may be, or any successor thereto or parent company
thereof, (B) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of
equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or
otherwise, of any of its assets or that of its Subsidiaries (including stock
or other ownership interests of its Subsidiaries) representing more than
twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of Post and the
Post Subsidiaries, or MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries, as the case may be, on a
consolidated basis, (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including
by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, joint venture, business
combination or otherwise) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities) representing more
than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding voting securities of Post, Post
LP, MAA or MAA LP, as the case may be, or any successor thereto or parent
company thereof, (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) acquiring beneficial ownership (as such
term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the
right to acquire beneficial ownership, of more than twenty percent (20%) of
the outstanding shares of the outstanding voting securities of Post, Post LP,
MAA or MAA LP, as the case may be, or any successor thereto or parent company
thereof, (E) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar type of transaction in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
outstanding voting securities of Post, Post LP, MAA or MAA LP, as the case may
be, or any successor thereto or parent company thereof, or (F) a merger, joint
venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving Post or MAA, as the case may be,
pursuant to which the shareholders of Post or MAA, as the case may be,
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty percent (80%) of
the voting equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal
or offer made by one Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) being
hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to
any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any
attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or execute or enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement providing for any Acquisition Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement"),
or (iv) publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

(b)

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Post
Board and the MAA Board shall each be permitted to take the following actions,
prior to receipt of the Post Shareholder Approval or MAA Shareholder Approval,
as applicable, in each case in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person made after the date of this Agreement
(provided that the Acquisition Proposal by such Person did not result from a
breach of this _Section 7.4_ (other than an unintentional and inadvertent
breach hereof that was not intended to result in an Acquisition Proposal
nevertheless resulted in an Acquisition Proposal)) and which the Post Board or
the MAA Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) either constitutes or would
likely lead to a Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the
directors of Post or MAA, as applicable, conclude in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (A) engage in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal, (B) provide
any nonpublic information or data to the Person who made such Acquisition
Proposal after entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined below) with such Person, and (C) effect any nonappealable, final
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders Post or MAA, as
applicable, to take; _provided_ , _however_ , that MAA or Post, as applicable,
shall have an opportunity to appear before any such court of competent
jurisdiction with respect to such matter if such court will entertain MAAs
or Posts, as applicable, motion to be heard with respect to such action. Post
and MAA, as applicable, shall provide the other Party with a copy of any
nonpublic information or data provided to a Third Party pursuant to the prior
sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such information to such
Third Party to the extent such nonpublic information or data has not been
previously

 



67  provided to MAA or Post, as the case may be. For purposes herein, an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no more favorable to the applicable counterparty
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to MAA,
provided that such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or
no standstill restriction and shall not be required to restrict the
submission of an Acquisition Proposal to the Post Board or the MAA Board, as
applicable; _provided_ _further_ that if the provisions of such
confidentiality agreement (including without limitation any
provisions related to a standstill restriction) are materially more favorable
or less restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its
Affiliates and representatives named therein) than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement are with respect to MAA, then, notwithstanding the
foregoing, such agreement will be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement if Post offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement so as to make
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as materially favorable or as
unrestrictive in the aggregate as the confidentiality agreement signed by such
counterparty.

 

(ii) Each Party shall notify the other Party promptly (but in no event later
than one (1) Business Day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
that such Person is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations
with such Party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
be made orally and promptly thereafter confirmed in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals
or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any material
documentation or correspondence that sets forth any terms of such Acquisition
Proposal). Each Party shall also promptly, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day, notify the other Party, orally and promptly thereafter in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this _Section 7.4(c)_ and keep the other Party promptly
informed in all material respects of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a timely basis, including by
promptly providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence
relating thereto.

 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_ ,
neither the Post Board, the MAA Board, nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other Party, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the
other Party, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, or any such committee thereof
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a
"Change in Post Recommendation" or a "Change in MAA Recommendation,"
respectively).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable,
may make in writing a Change in Post Recommendation or a Change in MAA
Recommendation, as applicable (and in the event that the Post Board or the MAA
Board, as applicable, determines such Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior
Proposal, in accordance with this _Section 7.4_ , terminate this Agreement in
writing pursuant to _Section 9.1_ ), if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of this _Section 7.4_ (other than an unintentional
and inadvertent breach hereof that was not intended to result in an
Acquisition Proposal nevertheless resulted in an Acquisition Proposal)) is
made to Post or MAA, as applicable, and is not withdrawn, (B) the Post Board
or the MAA Board, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the directors of
Post or MAA, as applicable, have concluded in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (D) four (4) Business Days (the
"Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Party proposing to take such
action has given written notice to the other Party advising such other Party
that the notifying Party intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a
"Notice of Recommendation Change"), which Notice of

 



68  Recommendation Change or intention shall not be deemed a Change in Post
Recommendation or Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, for any purpose
of this Agreement, (E) during such Notice Period, the notifying Party has
considered and, at the reasonable request of the other Party, engaged in good
faith discussions with such Party regarding any adjustment or modification of
the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party, and (F) the
directors of the Party proposing to take such action, following such Notice
Period, again conclude in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by the other Party) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law and that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that (1) if, during the Notice Period, any material revisions
are made to the Superior Proposal (it being understood that a material
revision shall include, without limitation, any material change in the
purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal), the Post
Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, shall promptly give a new written
notice to the other Party and shall comply in all respects with the
requirements of this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ , which shall apply anew, with
respect to such new written notice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in this
instance the Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days instead of four
(4) Business Days) and (2) in the event the Post Board or the MAA Board, as
applicable, does not determine that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, but thereafter determines to make a Change in Post Recommendation or
a Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, pursuant to this  _Section
7.4_ with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing procedures
referred to in this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ shall apply anew and shall also apply
to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change with respect thereto (
_provided_ , _however_ , that in this instance the Notice Period shall be
three (3) Business Days instead of four (4) Business Days).

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Post
Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, may make a Change in Post
Recommendation or a Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, if and only
if (A) a material fact, effect, event, development or change in circumstances
has occurred or arisen after the date of this Agreement that was not known to
such Party (or, if known, the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable to the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, as of the date
of this Agreement) (and which change or development does not relate to an
Acquisition Proposal), (B) the directors of the Party proposing to take such
action have first reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (C) four (4) Business Days (the
"Intervening Event Notice Period") shall have elapsed since the Party
proposing to take such action has given a Notice of Recommendation Change
(which Notice of Recommendation Change or intention shall not be deemed a
Change in Post Recommendation or Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable,
for any purpose of this Agreement) to the other Party advising that the
notifying Party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, (D) during such four-Business Day period, the
notifying Party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the
other Party, engaged in good faith discussions with such Party regarding, any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other Party, and (E) the directors of the Party proposing to take such action,
following such Intervening Event Notice Period, again reasonably determine in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed
by the other Party) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, does not make a Change
in Post Recommendation or a Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable,
following such four-Business Day period, but thereafter determines to make a
Change in Post Recommendation or a Change in MAA Recommendation, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in circumstances not involving an
Acquisition Proposal, the foregoing procedures referred to in this _Section
7.4(b)(v)_ shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal,
amendment or change ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in this instance the
Intervening Event Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days instead of
four (4) Business Days).

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit either Party or
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, from (A) taking and disclosing to
its respective shareholders or unitholders a position 

 



69  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to its shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, (B) making any other disclosure to its shareholders with
regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition
Proposal that the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, determines
(after consultation with outside counsel) is reasonably required by applicable
Law or (C) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position thereunder; _provided_ , that any such disclosure that addresses
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Post Board
or the MAA Board, as applicable, with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Post Recommendation or
Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable, unless the Post Board or the MAA
Board, as applicable, in connection with such communication publicly
states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of such party, without disclosing any Change in Post
Recommendation or Change in MAA Recommendation, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Post Board nor the MAA Board, as applicable,
may make a Change in Post Recommendation or Change in MAA Recommendation, as
applicable, unless permitted by this _Section 7.4_.

(c) For purposes of this _Section 7.4_ and this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of
this definition, the references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to
"twenty percent (20%)" and to "eighty percent (80%)" shall be replaced by
"seventy-five percent (75%)") made by a Third Party that does not contain any
financing conditions and is otherwise on terms that the Post Board or the MAA
Board, as applicable, determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking
into account all factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Post
Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, including financial, legal, regulatory
and any other aspects of the transaction (including the identity of the
Person making such proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, conditions to consummation and certainty of consummation
(including whether consummation is reasonably capable of being completed on a
timely basis on the terms proposed), as well as any changes to the financial
terms of this Agreement in response to such proposal or otherwise) described
in such proposal, would, if consummated, be more favorable to Post and
its shareholders, or to MAA and its shareholders, as applicable, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Post and MAA agrees that (i) it will and will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Third Parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any Third Party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each
of Post and MAA agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.4_.

 

(e)

(i) Notwithstanding any Change in Post Recommendation or Change in MAA
Recommendation, as applicable, unless, in the case of a Change in Post
Recommendation, such Change in Post Recommendation is with respect to a
Superior Proposal and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_
, (A) Post shall cause the adoption of this Agreement to be submitted to a
vote of its shareholders at the Post Shareholder Meeting and (B) MAA shall
cause (x) the amendment to the MAA Charter that increases the number of
authorized shares of MAA Common Stock to 145,000,000 and (y) the approval of
the issuance of the MAA Common Stock to be issued in the Parent Merger to be
submitted to a vote of its shareholders at the MAA Shareholder Meeting.

(ii) Without the prior written consent of each of Post and MAA (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby is the only matter, other than (A) a vote to approve an amendment to
the 

 



70  MAA Charter to increase the authorized shares of MAA Common Stock, (B) a
vote on the issuance of the MAA Common Stock to be issued in the Parent
Merger, and/or (C) any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be required
pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c)
thereunder and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Post Shareholder
Meeting or the MAA Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, if necessary, to
solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes
at the time of the Post Shareholder Meeting or the MAA Shareholder Meeting, as
applicable, to obtain the approval of Posts shareholders or MAAs
shareholders, as applicable, which either Post or MAA, as applicable, shall
propose to be acted on by its respective shareholders at the Post Shareholder
Meeting or the MAA Shareholder Meeting, as applicable.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.4_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, if Post or MAA, as applicable, receives a
written Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party following the date hereof
(provided that the Acquisition Proposal from such Third Party did not result
from a breach of this _Section 7.4_ (other than an unintentional and
inadvertent breach hereof that was not intended to result in an Acquisition
Proposal nevertheless resulted in an Acquisition Proposal)), then Post or MAA,
as applicable, or its respective Representatives may contact such Third Party
in writing solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal (the
"Clarification Request"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Post shall deliver a
copy of all Clarification Requests to MAA, and MAA shall deliver a copy of
all Clarification Requests to Post, in each case promptly with the delivery of
such Clarification Requests to any Third Party.

 

(f) References in this _Section 7.4_ to the Post Board or the MAA Board shall
mean the board of directors of Post or the board of directors of MAA, as
applicable, or a duly authorized committee thereof.

(g) Neither Post nor MAA shall submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in
Post Recommendation, Change in MAA Recommendation or any action taken by Post
or the Post Board, or by MAA or the MAA Board, pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section 7.4_ , so long as this Agreement is an effect, the Parties
hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none
of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without obtaining the other
Parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange if for any reason it is not reasonably practicable to consult with
the other Party before making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
Mergers and the execution of this Agreement and shall make such joint press
release no later than one (1) Business Day following the date on which this
Agreement is signed.

 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification or similar agreement or under the Post Articles of
Incorporation, the Post Bylaws, the Post LP Agreement or, if applicable,
similar organizational documents (including any limited liability company
agreement or partnership agreement) or agreements of any Post Subsidiary
(including any successor entities) (the "Organizational Documents") or this
Agreement from and after the Parent Merger Effective Time, MAA and MAA
LP (the "Indemnifying Parties"), jointly and severally, shall, for a period
of six (6) years from the Parent Merger Effective Time: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or is during
any of the period from the date hereof through the date of the Parent Merger
Effective Time, serving as a manager, director, officer, trustee or fiduciary
of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries and acting in such
capacity (collectively, the "Indemnified

 



71  Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or not prohibited by applicable
Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii) promptly
(in any event within ten (10) Business Days after any request for payment or
advancement, as applicable) pay on behalf of or advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or not prohibited by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such
Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party
of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but
subject to MAAs receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Laws or any of the Organizational Documents that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for any amounts paid in settlement
effected without MAAs prior written consent and shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of
the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the extent
an Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that such Indemnified Party has
conflicting interests with one or more other Indemnified Parties in the
outcome of such action (in which event such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and expenses for which the
Indemnifying Parties shall be liable); _provided_ _further_ , that if, at any
time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Parent Merger Effective Time,
any Indemnified Party delivers to MAA or MAA LP a written notice asserting
that indemnification is required in accordance with this _Section 7.6_ with
respect to a Claim, then the provisions for indemnification contained in this
_Section 7.6_ with respect to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Parent Merger Effective Time and shall continue to apply
until such time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved. The
indemnification and advancement obligations of the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring
at or before the Parent Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of Post or any of
the Post Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used
in this _Section 7.6(a)_ : (A) the term "Claim" means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed Action (including that any Indemnified Party
in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such Action) or
inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
and whether instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and
the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken
in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto) or service as a
manager, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of Post or,
any of the Post Subsidiaries or, to the extent such person is or was serving
at the request or for the benefit of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries,
any other entity or any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by any of the
foregoing at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time; and (B) the term
"Claim Expenses" means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim, including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party
as contemplated in this _Section 7.6_. No Indemnifying Party shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination
with respect to, any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which

 



72  indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such Claim. No
Indemnified Party shall be liable for any amounts paid in any settlement
effected without its prior express written consent.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, MAA agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, agents or
fiduciaries of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries as provided in the
Organizational Documents and indemnification or similar agreements of Post
shall survive the Parent Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Parent
Merger Effective Time, (i) MAA shall and shall cause the MAA Subsidiaries
(including MAA LP) to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of MAA
and the MAA Subsidiaries (including MAA LP) to the Indemnified Parties and any
trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries (including fiduciaries under or
with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA)) of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries under the Organizational
Documents and any indemnification or similar agreement of Post or any Post
Subsidiary entered into prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and
(ii) subject to any limitations imposed by the TBCA and the TRULPA, the
charter and bylaws and the limited partnership agreement or
other organizational documents (including any limited liability company
agreement or partnership agreement) of MAA, MAA LP and the MAA Subsidiaries
(including any successor entities) and the organizational documents of any
applicable Post Subsidiary (including any limited liability company agreement
or partnership agreement) shall contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties and any trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
(including fiduciaries under or with respect to any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)) of Post or any of the Post
Subsidiaries with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Parent Merger
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, were
directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents or fiduciaries (including
fiduciaries under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)) of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries,
unless required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required
by applicable Law; _provided_ that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) _
_ anniversary of the Parent Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party
delivers to MAA or MAA LP a written notice asserting that indemnification is
required in accordance with this _Section 7.6_ with respect to a Claim,
then the provisions for indemnification contained in this _Section 7.6_ with
respect to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Parent
Merger Effective Time and shall continue to apply until such time as such
Claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, Post shall obtain and fully pay
the premium for, and MAA shall cause to be maintained in full force and
effect (and the obligations under to be honored), during the six (6) year
period beginning on the date of the Parent Merger Effective Time, a "tail"
prepaid insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their
respective express terms shall survive the Mergers) from Posts current
insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Posts current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable to the directors, officers, agents or
fiduciaries of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries as Posts and the
Post Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit of the
current and former directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of Post and each
Post Subsidiary with a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years
from the Parent Merger Effective Time with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance for Claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable for such
"tail" insurance policy for its entire period exceed an amount per year of
coverage equal to 300% of the current annual premium paid by Post for such
insurance (such amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Post is unable to
obtain the "tail" insurance described in the first sentence of this _Section
7.6(c)_ for an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, Post shall
be entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an
amount equal to

 



73  the Maximum Premium. If Post is unable to, or does not, obtain and fully pay
the premium for such "tail" insurance contemplated in the two preceding
sentences, MAA shall obtain and fully pay the premium for and maintain in
full force and effect (and honor the obligations under), during the six (6)
year period beginning on the date of the Parent Merger Effective Time, a
"tail" insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their
respective express terms shall survive the Mergers) from Posts current
insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Posts current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable to directors, officers, agents, or
fiduciaries of Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries as Post or any of the
Post Subsidiaries existing policy or policies for the benefit of the current
and former directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of Post or any Post
Subsidiary with a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from
the Parent Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall MAA be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the aggregate
premium for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period, in which
case MAA will obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an
amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) If any of MAA, MAA LP or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of MAA or MAA LP, as applicable, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

(e) MAA shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.6_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses
if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and other
Person referred to in this _Section 7.6_ (who are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_ ), his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
MAA and Post, and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the
Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors,
assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification
provided for by this _Section 7.6_ shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or exculpation which an
Indemnified Party and other Person referred to in this _Section 7.6_ is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under the Organizational Documents, the GBCC, any other Law, any
agreement with any Indemnified Party or other Person with Post or any Post
Subsidiary, any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Post or any of the Post Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
managers, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that (i)
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.6_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies; (ii) the
indemnification provided by Post, MAA and MAA LP under this _Section 7.6_ with
respect to any Claim shall be specifically in excess of any valid and
collectible insurance available to such Persons for such Claim; and (iii) to
the extent that any Indemnified Party receives any payment with respect to a
Claim under any insurance maintained by Post, MAA or MAA LP after payment by
Post, MAA or MAA LP of any amounts with respect to indemnification provided
for in this _Section 7.6_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the
duplicative portion of such insurance payment to Post, MAA or MAA LP, as
applicable.

 



74 Section 7.7 _Appropriate Action; Consents_

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
Post and MAA shall, and shall cause the Post Subsidiaries and the MAA
Subsidiaries, respectively, to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of
all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VIII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Persons (other than
Governmental Authorities, which are addressed in _Section 7.3_ ) necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations
and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) subject to _Section 7.8(e)_ , the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of MAA and
Post shall use its reasonable best efforts to give (or shall cause the MAA
Subsidiaries or the Post Subsidiaries, respectively, use its reasonable best
efforts to give) any notices to third parties, and each of MAA and Post shall
use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by _Section
7.7(a)_ that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, if requested by MAA, the Post Parties shall take
such actions as are reasonably necessary to liquidate Post GP and the limited
partner of Post LP that is a subsidiary of Post and distribute the interests
in Post LP held by Post GP and such subsidiary to Post.

 

(d) Immediately prior to the Closing, if requested by MAA, the Post Parties
shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to liquidate special
purpose entities holding up to $800 million of assets and distribute such
assets to Post LP to the extent necessary to permit MAA and MAA LP to satisfy
certain bond covenants following the Closing (including a reasonable amount
in excess of such covenants) and to the extent such assets are reasonably
available in special purpose entities.

Section 7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) The Post Parties shall give prompt notice to the MAA Parties, and the MAA
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Post Parties, of any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Post Parties shall give prompt notice to the MAA Parties, and the
MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Post Parties, if (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that, if uncured, would reasonably be expected to
result in any of the applicable closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_
I not being capable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date or (ii) it
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement such that, if uncured, would result in any of the applicable closing
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Post Parties shall give prompt notice to 

 



75  the MAA Parties, and the MAA Parties shall give prompt notice to the Post
Parties, if, to the Knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any state of
facts, change, development, event or condition would cause, or would
reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VIII_ not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be reasonably delayed.

Section 7.19 _Dividends_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Parent
Merger Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1_ , neither MAA nor Post shall make, declare or set aside any dividend or
other distribution to its respective stockholders without the prior written

be required (but written notice shall be given) for (i) in the case of Post,
the authorization and payment of quarterly distributions at a rate not in
excess of the regular quarterly cash dividend most recently declared prior to
the date of this Agreement (which is $0.47 per quarter) and (ii) in the case
of MAA, for the authorization and payment of quarterly distributions at a rate

Stock and the holders of MAA Common Stock receiving dividends covering the

Agreement, each of Post and MAA, as applicable, shall be permitted to declare
and pay a dividend to its stockholders, the record date and payment date for
which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, distributing any amounts determined by such Party (in each case
in consultation with the other Party) to be the minimum dividend required to
be distributed in order for such Party to qualify as a REIT and to avoid to
the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise Tax (any
dividend paid pursuant to this paragraph, a "REIT Dividend").

(c) If either Party determines that it is necessary to declare a REIT
Dividend, it shall notify the other Party at least 20 days prior to the date
of the Post Shareholder Meeting, in the case of a declaration by Post, or the
MAA Shareholder Meeting, in the case of a declaration by MAA, and such other
Party shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the
case of Post, to holders of Post Common Stock, in an amount per share of Post
Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the REIT Dividend
declared by MAA with respect to each share of MAA Common Stock by (B) the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case of MAA, to holders of MAA Common Stock, in
an amount per share of MAA Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the REIT

(including Post LP and MAA LP)), MAA shall, and shall cause each MAA
Subsidiary (including Post LP and MAA LP), as applicable, to, provide each
individual who is an employee of Post or any Post Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing and who remains employed by Post, any Post Subsidiary,
MAA or any MAA Subsidiary (including Post LP and MAA LP) immediately following
the Closing (each a "Continuing Employee" and collectively, the "Continuing
Employees") with compensation and benefits, that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of MAA or
the MAA Subsidiary, as applicable, immediately following the Closing. During
the period commencing on the Closing and ending on the date that is six (6)
months after the Closing, MAA shall, and shall cause each MAA Subsidiary
to, provide each Continuing Employee, to the extent their employment is
severed during such period, with severance payments and benefits equal to the
greater of the severance payments and benefits provided by (i) MAA or any MAA
Subsidiary or (ii) Post and the Post Subsidiaries prior to the date of this
Agreement and as set forth in Section 7.20(a) of the Post Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) MAA shall, and shall cause the MAA Subsidiaries (including Post LP and MAA
LP) to, provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of service with
Post and the Post Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of Post or any Post Subsidiary) for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit level, but not for purposes of any benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement of MAA or the MAA Subsidiaries (including
Post LP and MAA LP) (including vacation, paid time-off and severance
arrangements) to the same extent that such service was recognized under a
similar plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Post or any Post
Subsidiary, except that no such prior service credit will be required or
provided to the extent that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits, or
(ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Post Employee
Benefit Plan.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, MAA shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each MAA Employee Benefit Plan in which any Continuing
Employee participates that provides health or welfare

 



80  benefits to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, waiting periods and service conditions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees,
other than limitations applicable under the corresponding Post Employee
Benefit Plan or to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not
have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Post Employee Benefit Plan
and (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-
pocket maximums under the corresponding Post Employee Benefit Plan in
satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments
under a corresponding Post Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.20_ shall (i) confer any rights upon any
Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of Post or the
Post Subsidiaries, other than the Parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an
employment agreement or create any right in any Continuing Employee or
any other Person to any continued employment or service with or for Post, the
Post Subsidiaries, MAA, or the MAA Subsidiaries, or to any compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, (iii) constitute or be treated as
an amendment, modification, adoption, suspension or termination of any
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Post, the
Post Subsidiaries, MAA, or the MAA Subsidiaries, or (iv) alter or limit the
ability of Post, the Post Subsidiaries, MAA, or the MAA Subsidiaries to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them.

 

(e) Post, the Post Subsidiaries, MAA and the MAA Subsidiaries hereby
acknowledge that (i) the Mergers will constitute a "Change in Control" (or
concept of similar import) under the Post Employee Benefit Plans and (ii) as a
result of the Merger, the individuals identified in Section 7.20(e) of the
Post Disclosure Letter will be deemed to have experienced a "Good Reason"
event (or concept of similar import), as applicable, for all purposes under
the Post Employee Benefit Plans.

periods commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2006, MAA has been
organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT under the Code and that its past, current and intended
future organization and operations will permit MAA to continue to qualify for
taxation as a REIT under the Code for its taxable year which includes the
Parent Merger Effective Time and thereafter (which opinion shall be based
upon the representation letters described in _Section 7.17(a)(ii)(B)_ and
_Section 7.17(b)(ii)(A)_ ).

Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel shall rely upon the tax
representation letters described in _Section 7.17(a)(iii)_ and _Section
7.17(b)(iii)_.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Parent Merger Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the MAA
Board or Post Board, as applicable, as follows:

(a) by mutual consent of MAA and Post in a written instrument;

 



83 (b) by either MAA or Post, upon written notice to the other Party, if any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Mergers, and such order, decree, ruling or other action has
become final and nonappealable;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, such action;

(c) by either MAA or Post, upon written notice to the other Party, if the
Mergers shall not have been consummated on or before 5:00 p.m. (New York
time) on February 28, 2017 (such date and time referred to as the "Outside
Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure
to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before such date;

 

(d) by either MAA or Post, upon written notice to the other Party, if there
shall have been a breach by the other Party of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of such other Party, which breach, either individually
or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ ,
as the case may be, unless such breach is reasonably capable of being cured,
and the other Party shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts to cure
such breach, prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , that a Party shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_
if such Party is then in breach of any of its own respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section
8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ , as the case may be, would not be satisfied;

(e) by either MAA or Post, if the MAA Shareholder Approval or
Post Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken
thereon at the duly convened MAA Shareholder Meeting or Post Shareholder
Meeting, as the case may be (including after taking into account any
adjournment, postponement or recess thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(e)_ shall not be
available to MAA where a failure to obtain the MAA Shareholder Approval was
primarily caused by any action or failure to act of a MAA Party that
constitutes a breach of its obligations under _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.4_
(other than an unintentional and inadvertent breach of _Section 7.4_ that was
not intended to result in an Acquisition Proposal nevertheless resulted in an
Acquisition Proposal), and the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(e)_ shall not be available to Post where a failure to obtain the
Post Shareholder Approval was primarily caused by any action or failure to
act of a Post Party that constitutes a breach of its obligations under
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.4_ (other than an unintentional and inadvertent
breach of _Section 7.4_ that was not intended to result in an
Acquisition Proposal nevertheless resulted in an Acquisition Proposal);

(f) by Post, by written notice to MAA:

 

(i) at any time prior to the receipt of the Post Shareholder Approval in order
to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 7.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement
may not be so terminated unless the payment required by _Section 9.3(a)(v)_ is
made in full to MAA substantially concurrently with the occurrence of such
termination and the entry into such Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, and in the event that such Acquisition Agreement is not
substantially concurrently entered into and such payment is not concurrently
made, such termination shall be null and void; or

(ii) if the MAA Board shall have made a Change in MAA Recommendation (
_provided_ that it is understood and agreed that neither a Notice of
Recommendation Change nor the intention underlying such Notice of
Recommendation Change that is not publicly made shall in and of itself
be considered a Change in MAA Recommendation; _provided_ _further_ that
Posts right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)(ii)_
in respect of a Change in MAA Recommendation shall expire ten (10)
Business Days after the date on which Post receives notice from MAA of such
Change in MAA Recommendation);

 



84 (g) by MAA, by written notice to Post:

 

(i) at any time prior to the receipt of the MAA Shareholder Approval in order
to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 7.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement
may not be so terminated unless the payment required by _Section 9.3(a)(vii)_
is made in full to Post substantially concurrently with the occurrence of
such termination and the entry into such Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, and in the event that such Acquisition Agreement is
not substantially concurrently entered into and such payment is not
concurrently made, such termination shall be null and void; or

(ii) if the Post Board shall have made a Change in Post Recommendation (
_provided_ that it is understood and agreed that neither a Notice of
Recommendation Change nor the intention underlying such Notice of
Recommendation Change that is not publicly made shall in and of itself
be considered a Change in Post Recommendation; _provided_ _further_ that
MAAs right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)(ii)_
in respect of a Change in Post Recommendation shall expire ten (10)
Business Days after the date on which MAA receives notice from Post of such
Change in Post Recommendation).

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor in
reasonable detail, and subject to compliance with _Section 9.3_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no further force or
effect whatsoever without liability on the part of any Party hereto, and all
rights and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such
termination shall relieve any Party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of fraud or any willful breach of this
Agreement; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 7.2(b)_ , this
_Section 9.2_ , _Section 9.3_ , Article X (other than _Section 10.1_ )
and the definitions of all defined terms appearing in such sections shall
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and
other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable,
shall be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or other Person to which
they were made. For purposes of the foregoing, "willful breach" shall mean a
material breach that is a consequence of either (i) an act knowingly
undertaken by the breaching Party with the intent of causing a breach of this
Agreement or (ii) an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching Party that was
reasonably likely to result in a breach of this Agreement (even if a breach
of this Agreement was not the conscious object of such act) and which in fact
does cause a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fees and Expense Amount_.

 

(a) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by either MAA or Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(e)_
(due to a failure to obtain the Post Shareholder Approval) or by MAA pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)_ and, in all cases, as of the date of the termination of
this Agreement (A) all conditions to the consummation of the Mergers set forth
in _Section 8.1(c)_ and _Section 8.3_ (other than _Section 8.3(f)_ ) have
been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied) and (B) there shall not
have been a failure to obtain the MAA Shareholder Approval at a vote taken
thereon at the duly convened MAA Shareholder Meeting and Post (1) receives or
has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to Post, which
proposal has been publicly announced prior to the date of the Post Shareholder
Meeting (with respect to a termination under  _Section 9.1(e)_ ) or prior to
the date of the termination of this Agreement (with respect to a termination
under _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ ) and, (2) within twelve (12)
months of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction
regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with
respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, then Post shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to MAA the Termination Fee plus, if not previously paid pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)(iii)_ below, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account designated by MAA, not later than the consummation of such
transaction arising from such Acquisition Proposal; 

 



85   _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 9.3(a_ )(i),
the references to "twenty percent (20%)" and to "eighty percent (80%)" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"seventy-five percent (75%)";

(ii) by either MAA or Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(e)_
(due to a failure to obtain the MAA Shareholder Approval) or by Post pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)_ and, in all cases, as of the date of the termination of
this Agreement (A) all conditions to the consummation of the Mergers set
forth in _Section 8.1(c)_ and _Section 8.2_ (other than _Section 8.2(f)_ )
have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied) and (B) there shall
not have been a failure to obtain the Post Shareholder Approval at a vote
taken thereon at the duly convened Post Shareholder Meeting and MAA (1)
receives or has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to MAA,
which proposal has been publicly announced prior to the date of the MAA
Shareholder Meeting (with respect to a termination under _Section 9.1(e)_ ) or
prior to the date of the termination of this Agreement (with respect to a
termination under _Section 9.1(c)_  or _Section 9.1(d)_ ) and, (2) within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a
transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later
consummated with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal, then MAA shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Post the Termination Fee plus, if not previously paid
pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(iv)_ below, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account designated by Post, not later than the
consummation of such transaction arising from such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that for purposes of this _Section 9.3(a)(ii)_ , the
references to "twenty percent (20%)" and to "eighty percent (80%)" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"seventy-five percent (75%)";

 

(iii) by either MAA or Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ because the Post
Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained, then Post shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to MAA the Expense Amount (by wire transfer to an account
designated by MAA) within two (2) Business Days of such termination;

 

(iv) by either MAA or Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ because the MAA
Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained, then MAA shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Post the Expense Amount (by wire transfer to an account
designated by Post) within two (2) Business Days of such termination;

 

(v) by Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)(i)_ then Post shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to MAA the Termination Fee together with the Expense Amount, by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by MAA as a condition to
the effectiveness of such termination;

 

(vi) by Post pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)(ii)_ , then MAA shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Post the Termination Fee together with the Expense Amount, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Post, within two
(2) Business Days of such termination;

 

(vii) by MAA pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)(i)_ , then MAA shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Post the Termination Fee together with the Expense Amount, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Post as a
condition to the effectiveness of such termination; or

 

(viii) by MAA pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)(ii)_ , then Post shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to MAA the Termination Fee together with the Expense Amount, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by MAA, within two
(2) Business Days of such termination.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstances shall MAA or Post be required to pay the
Termination Fee or the Expense Amount on more than one occasion; and

(ii) neither MAA nor Post shall be required to pay any amount in excess of the
sum of the Termination Fee and the Expense Amount, except as set forth in
_Section 9.3(c)_ or in the case of such Partys fraud or willful breach of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the

 



86  Expense Amount is a penalty, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if MAA or Post, as the case
may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_
and, in order to obtain such payment, either MAA or Post, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other Party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this  _Section 9.3_ , such paying Party
shall pay the other Party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date of payment for the period from the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 

(d) Limitations on Payment.

 

(i) If one Party to this Agreement (the "Fee Payor") is required to pay
another Party to this Agreement (the "Fee Payee") an Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, such Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable,
shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by
the Fee Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this
_Section 9.3(d)_. In the event that the Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Fee
Payee the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, the amount
payable to the Fee Payee in any tax year of the Fee Payee shall not exceed the
lesser of (i) the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, of the
Fee Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Fee Payee without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying Income") and the Fee Payee has
income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its
gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the Fee Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event
the Fee Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Fee Payees counsel
indicating that the Fee Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described
below in this _Section 9.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the Fee Payees outside
counsel as described below in this _Section 9.3(d)_ , an amount equal to the
excess of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, less
the total amount paid under clause (A) above.

 

(ii) To secure the Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Fee Payor
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount or
the Termination Fee, as applicable, with an escrow agent selected by the Fee
Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 9.3(d)_ ) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Fee Payor, the Fee Payee and the escrow agent. The payment
or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Fee Payee such amount pursuant to  _Section
9.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense
Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Fee Payee unless the escrow agent receives any
one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Fee Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Fee Payee without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Fee
Payee has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to
1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the
escrow agent shall release such amount to the Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter from
the Fee Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Fee Payee received a ruling
from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Fee Payee of the Expense Amount
and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) the Fee Payees outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Fee Payee of
the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount and/or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, to the Fee Payee. The Fee Payor agrees to
amend this _Section 9.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the Fee Payee in
order 

 



87  to (i) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination
Fee, as applicable, that may be distributed to the Fee Payee hereunder without
causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Fee Payees chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this _Section 9.3(d)_ or (iii) assist the Fee
Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this _Section 9.3(d)_. Any amount of the Expense Amount and/or
the Termination Fee, as applicable, that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 9.3(d)_ ;
_provided_ , that the obligation of the Fee Payor to pay the unpaid portion of
the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, shall terminate
on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date of
this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne
solely by the Fee Payee.

 

Any payment due to a Party described in _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be subject to
the same limitations on payment as set forth in this  _Section 9.3(d)_.

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.3_ , all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses whether or not the Mergers
are consummated.

 

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by the Post Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Mergers by the
shareholders of MAA, shareholders of Post or holders of MAA OP Units, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires
further approval by such shareholders or holders without such further approval
by such shareholders or holders. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto.

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the Post
Board or the MAA Board, as applicable, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other Party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of a Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any
waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or
other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to each other Party (including by means of electronic delivery), it
being understood that the Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf"), or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the schedules, documents and the instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
(other than the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except for (i) the
rights, benefits and remedies granted to the Indemnified Parties under
_Section 7.6_ , (ii) after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of Post OP Units to receive the consideration set forth in
_Article III_ in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) after
the Parent Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Post Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration, the rights of the holders of Post
Preferred Stock to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration, and the rights
of holders of Post Options and Post Restricted Stock Awards to receive the
consideration specified in _Article III_  in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement, and (iv) the right of Post and MAA, on behalf of its
respective shareholders, to pursue claims for damages and other relief,
including equitable relief, for the other Parties willful breach of this
Agreement, to the extent recovery is otherwise permitted under _Section 9.2_.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly,
Persons other

 



90  than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in
this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 10.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into
and performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to any
provisions relating to choice of laws among different jurisdictions, except
that (i) the provisions of the GBCC and the TBCA applicable to the
authorization, effectiveness and effects of the Parent Merger and the
provisions of the GRULPA and the TRULPA applicable to the authorization,
effectiveness and effects of the Partnership Merger will apply to the Parent
Merger and the Partnership Merger and (ii) the applicable Law of the State of
Georgia and the State of Tennessee shall apply to the discharge of the
fiduciary duties of the Post Board, the MAA Board or any committees thereof in
connection herewith.

 

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance; Venue_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto
fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and, more specifically, that
irreparable damage would occur if the Mergers were not consummated, including
the parties obligations to consummate the Mergers and the obligation of the
MAA Parties to pay, and the right of the holders of Post Common Stock and the
holders of Post Series A Preferred Stock right to receive, the aggregate
Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable,
pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement), and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of
damages or otherwise (including the Parties obligations to consummate the
Mergers and the obligation of the MAA Parties to pay, and the right of the
holders of Post Common Stock and the holders of Post Series A Preferred Stock
right to receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom, unless such court shall
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (in the Complex Commercial
Litigation Division thereof if permitted by the applicable rules of the
Superior Court) and any appellate court therefrom or, if the Superior Court
of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court located in the State of Delaware and any federal
appellate court therefrom (collectively, the "Delaware Courts"), and each

 



91  Party hereto hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party agrees that
the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right
neither the Post Parties nor the MAA Parties would have entered into this
Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. If, prior to the Outside Date, any
party brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement by another party, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such action
is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action.

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including with respect to any
claim or cause of action whether at Law, in equity, in contract or tort and
with respect to any claim or cause of action relating to the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement) brought by any other Party or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware Courts
(subject to the order of preference of each of the Delaware Courts set forth
in _Section 10.8(a)_ ), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any
such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties agrees not to commence
any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the Delaware Courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY DESIGNATES CT CORPORATION (IN SUCH CAPACITY,
THE "PROCESS AGENT"), WITH AN OFFICE AT 1209 NORTH ORANGE STREET, WILMINGTON,
DELAWARE 19801 AS ITS DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE AND AGENT TO RECEIVE, FOR AND ON ITS
BEHALF SERVICE OF PROCESS IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, AND SUCH SERVICE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY THEREOF TO
THE PROCESS AGENT; PROVIDED THAT IN THE CASE OF ANY SUCH SERVICE UPON THE
PROCESS AGENT, THE PARTY EFFECTING SUCH SERVICE SHALL ALSO DELIVER A
COPY THEREOF TO EACH OTHER SUCH PARTY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION
10.2_. EACH PARTY SHALL TAKE ALL SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONTINUE
SAID APPOINTMENT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT SO THAT
SUCH PARTY WILL AT ALL TIMES HAVE AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR THE
ABOVE PURPOSES IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT
OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH
PARTY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE
UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AND THAT SERVICE MADE AS PROVIDED HEREIN SHALL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL FORCE AND
EFFECT AS IF SERVED UPON SUCH PARTY PERSONALLY WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

(d) Each of the Parties further agrees that notice as provided herein
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the Parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts as described herein for any reason, (ii)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in the Delaware Courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

 



92 (e) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AGREEING TO
THE CHOICE OF DELAWARE LAW TO GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE JURISDICTION
OF DELAWARE COURTS IN CONNECTION WITH PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES INTEND
THIS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CHOICE OF DELAWARE LAW AND AN EFFECTIVE CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS UNDER 6 DEL. C. § 2708, INCLUDING THAT
THIS AGREEMENT INVOLVES OVER $100,000 FOR PURPOSES OF THE APPLICATION OF 6
DEL. C. § 2708\.

 

Section 10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.9_.

 

Section 10.10 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
