material respects, designed to be effective, and to the Knowledge of the Company are effective, to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and
procedures that comply in all material respects with the requirements under the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and
its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company&#146;s auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (A)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies of which the

control over financial reporting. Since January&nbsp;1, 2010, no material complaints regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material concerns from Company
employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company
that are unresolved. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is, in all material respects, sufficient to provide reasonable assurance

external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
