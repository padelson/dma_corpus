   #####

The provisions of this _Section 1.3_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Merger Sub, Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

    ##### 

  

    

of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then shall remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall use reasonable best efforts to
appoint or elect to the Company Board of Directors three (3) persons meeting
the foregoing criteria, which persons shall not be directors, officers,
employees or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub and such persons shall be
deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the

bylaws of the Company in any manner adverse to the Company Shareholders, and
any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects or could
adversely affect the Company Shareholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub)
may be effected only if (in addition to the approval of the Company Board of
Directors as a whole) such action is approved by a majority of the Continuing
Directors then in office. Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to remove
any Continuing Director except for negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or
cause. 

   

 (d) After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status.

The Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable until such time as Merger Sub shall have deposited the payment for all accepted Shares with the depositary agent for the Offer and, if a "subsequent offering period" is provided, for all Shares tendered in the "subsequent offering period, and in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable (x) if the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been waived, (y) more than once or (z) unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, and accounting for the limitations set forth herein, Parent and Merger Sub would hold one (1) Share more than 90.00% of the outstanding Shares. Upon Parents request, the Company shall use its 

    ##### 

  

    

commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to notify Parent
in writing of the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Company has reserved, and
shall continue to reserve and maintain free from preemptive rights, out of
its authorized but unissued shares of common stock of the Company, par value
$0.10 per share, the (" _Common Stock_ ") all authorized and unissued shares

except for Shares issuable upon the exercise of Company Options outstanding
under the Stock Plans as of the date hereof. 

   

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "). 

   

 (c) Subject to the limitations on exercise of the Top-Up Option set forth in _Section 1.4(a_ ), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, exercise, and take all action necessary action to exercise, the Top-Up Option, upon the written request of the Company. To exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the number of Shares that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii) the place, time and date (which date shall be no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of the Top-Up Exercise Notice) for the closing of the purchase and sale of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends to (and Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with the GBCC as contemplated by _Section 7.3(e)_. The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice (and in any event within 24 hours), deliver a written notice to Merger Sub confirming the number of Top-Up Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Top-Up Closing to occur on the same day the Top-Up Exercise Notice is received by the Company, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company, in the manner set forth in _Section 1.4(d_) hereof, the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares, in cash and/or aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Shares or, at Merger Subs request or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ").

Any such Promissory Note 

     ##### 

  

    

shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub and (i) shall bear
interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per annum, (ii) shall mature on the
first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium
or penalty.

Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). The parties agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the Dissenting Shares, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the payment by Merger Sub to the Company of any consideration for the Top-Up Shares should be considered by the court in connection with the determination in accordance with Article 13 of the GBCC of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (f) The number of Shares issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate so as to restore Merger Sub to its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up Option in the event of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction with respect to Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the GBCC, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease.

withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Article 13
of the GBCC and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares to the extent such holders do not also hold Shares that are not Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form approved by counsel to the Company prior to the Acceptance Time specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) or the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(g)_) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section 4.2(e)_) or Uncertificated Shares _multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered and the Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Company Shareholders for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(g)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or due transfer of its Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, 

    ##### 

  

    

Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

   

 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such customary and reasonable terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(g)_) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) No Person who has perfected a demand for dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to any Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to payment of the "fair value" for such shares under the GBCC with respect to such Dissenting Shares. If any such Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right at or following the Effective Time, each Dissenting Share held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Unless and until a Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Shareholders right to appraisal under the GBCC with respect to Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments received by the Company relating to shareholders rights of appraisal and with such notice to Parent provide to Parent a copy of all such demands, attempted withdrawals and other instruments received by the Company and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the GBCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Article 13 of the GBCC to receive payment of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to any required withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(g)_ (but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the GBCC). 

   

 (g) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a Person pursuant to this Agreement or the Offer any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the applicable deduction and withholding was made. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 4.3 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall declare that each option holders right to exercise each option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under the Stock Plans that is outstanding at such time shall, in accordance with and subject to the terms of such Company Options, upon the commencement of the Offer (provided that the Acceptance Time occurs), (i) become 100% vested and (ii) be exercisable at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (the " _Option Exercise Period_ "). To the extent not exercised within the Option Exercise Period, each outstanding Company Option shall, at the Effective Time, be terminated and converted, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration minus the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Option Payment_ "); _provided_ that if the per share exercise price payable with respect to a Company Option exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration (an " _Underwater Option_ "), then such Underwater Option shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration with respect thereto. The Company shall terminate the Stock Plans immediately as of the Effective Time, and, following the Acceptance Time, no participant in any Stock Plan shall have any right under any such Stock Plan (other than the right to receive the Option Payment, in the case of a Company Option, or the Per Share Merger Consideration, in the case of Restricted Stock), in accordance with the terms of this _Section 4.3_. The Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall take all necessary and appropriate action to enable the treatment of the Company Options and Stock Plans contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) The Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to provide that, with respect to each Share of restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans (collectively, the " _Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse, and (ii) the Restricted Stock shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested and transferable at the Acceptance Time. 

   

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ shall be reduced by the required withholding of Taxes, if any, and shall be paid without interest. Any amounts payable under this  _Section 4.3_ shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or a subsidiary thereof). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the applicable deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take all actions necessary (including any required amendment) such that the ESPP will terminate upon the Effective Time, no further purchase rights shall accrue after the date of this Agreement and all ESPP participants will automatically receive their accrued purchase rights under the ESPP upon the termination of the ESPP. 

   

 (e) The Company shall take all actions and shall obtain all necessary consents and releases from all of the holders of rights under the EMS Technologies Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the " _Directors Plan_ "), such that (i) the 

      ##### 

  

    

Directors Plan will terminate as of the Effective Time, and (ii) upon the
termination of the Directors Plan, each participants Deferral Account (as
defined in the Directors Plan) shall be automatically converted to cash and
will be paid to such participant in a lump sum as soon as practicable and, in
any event, within thirty (30) days of the termination of the Directors
Plan. 

   

 (f) The Company shall amend, as of the Effective Time, the provisions of any other Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any such Affiliate, or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company or any such Affiliate, to provide no continuing rights to acquire, hold, transfer or grant any capital stock of the Company or any such Affiliate or any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any such Affiliate. Except as otherwise contemplated herein, any then outstanding stock appreciation rights or other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time without any payment therefor, and the Company shall take all steps to ensure that neither it nor any of its Affiliates is or will be bound by any options, warrants, rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to own any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to receive any payment in respect thereof. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Subject to the Companys obligations pursuant to _Section 7.1,_ if the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction or the Company declares or makes any cash dividend or other cash or asset distribution with respect to the Shares, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

  

 Except (i) as disclosed in the Company Reports filed with the SEC since January 1, 2010 and prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (to the extent 

      ##### 

  

    

that such disclosure does not constitute a "risk factor" and was not included
in any section related to forward-looking statements to the extent that they
are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), or (ii) as set
forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or
concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent regardless of whether a specific cross-reference
is made), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
that: 

   

 Section 5.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority has not had or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation (or other legal entity) in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its material Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date hereof, and each as so made available is in full force and effect. 

   

 Section 5.2 _Capital Structure_. 

  

 (a) As of the close of business on June 10, 2011, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 75,000,000 Shares, of which 15,450,193 Shares were outstanding, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value per share, of which no shares are outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

   

 (b) Other than those Shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans, the amount of which is set forth on _Section 5.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. _Section 5.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of all Company Options and Restricted Stock under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant, number of Shares and where applicable, exercise price and vesting schedule. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. Except for options and other awards to acquire Shares under the Stock Plans, the Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the Company Shareholders on any matter. Each Company Option 

     ##### 

  

    

intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each Company Option was, on the
date of grant of such Company Option, not less than the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on such date of grant as determined by the Company
Board of Directors and no such Company Option has had its exercise price
decreased since its date of grant. Each Company Option: (i) has been granted
in compliance with the terms of the Stock Plans, (ii) has an exercise
price per share of Common Stock equal to or greater than the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock on the date such Company Option was granted
(and as of any later modification thereof within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code), (iii) has a grant date identical to the date on which
the Company Board of Directors or the authorized committee of the Company
Board of Directors actually awarded such Company Option (unless the such
board or committee authorized a later grant date), and (iv) each Company
Option grant date listed on _Schedule 5.2(b)_ is the grant date of
the respective Company Option for corporate, Tax and all other pertinent
purposes. 

   

 (c) _Section 5.2(c_) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) each of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary, and (ii) the Companys and its Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any other Person, other than securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding capital stock of such company. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any mortgage, easement, lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, restriction or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "). 

   

 (d) Other than, (w) the options and other awards granted under the Stock Plans and the rights to acquire Shares by the exercise of stock options and other awards under the Stock Plans, in each case outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (x) rights issued under the Rights Plan that are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (y) the Top-Up Option and (z) any shares of Common Stock issued in compliance with _Section 7.1(b)_, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, stock units, phantom rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls or commitments that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, or receive any payment based on the value of any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. There are no declared or unpaid dividends or accrued dividends with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company. 

   

 Section 5.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval; Fairness Opinion_. 

  

 (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to obtaining necessary shareholder approval (if required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger) (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "), to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly 

    ##### 

  

    

executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement has been
duly executed by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). 

   

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by unanimous vote of the Company Board of Directors and, except for (i) the Company Requisite Vote (if required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger) and (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or, assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 6.10_, any vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (c) The Company Board has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") are and at the Appointment Time will be, "independent directors" as defined in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and all applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. 

   

 (d) The Company Board of Directors has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Offer Price to be paid to the holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement is, as of the date of such opinion, fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries), a copy of which opinion will be delivered to Parent promptly after the date of this Agreement for informational purposes only and has not been modified or withdrawn.

notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits
or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those
that the failure to make or obtain would not reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Companys ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations, the modification of any right under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to any License of the Company or any Subsidiary any Material Contract or any Labor Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in  _Section 5.4(a)_, under any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries Material Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) Since January 1, 2010 (the " _Applicable Date_ "), the Company has filed all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed since the Applicable Date, including any amendments or supplements thereto the " _Company Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof, each of the Company Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates, the Company Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that the information in such Company Report has 

      ##### 

  

    

been amended or superseded by a later Company Report filed prior to the date
hereof. The Company has made available to Parent copies of all comment
letters received by the Company from the SEC since January 1, 2010
relating to the Company Reports, together with all written responses of the
Company thereto sent to the SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters received by the
Company from the SEC. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company Reports is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. None of the
Companys Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. 

   

 (b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of the Company. 

   

 (c) The Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are, in all material respects, designed to be effective, and to the Knowledge of the Company are effective, to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that comply in all material respects with the requirements under the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies of which the Company has Knowledge in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2010, no material complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material concerns from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company that are unresolved. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is, in all material respects, sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "). Since March 31, 2011, none of KPMG LLP or any other independent public accountants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. To the Knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or 

     ##### 

 

  

agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit committee (or other
committee designated for the purpose) of the Company Board of Directors or
the Company Board of Directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to
Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating
such reporting. 

   

 (d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) (i) was prepared from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date; and each of the consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules) (i) was prepared from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) fairly presents, in all material respects, the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (except as noted in the same financial statements included in the Company Reports and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the lack of footnotes and normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. 

   

 (e) There are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued, absolute, determined or contingent, which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the Companys audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 or in the notes thereto, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2010, or (iii) liabilities or obligations expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) All Benefit Plans have been established and have at all times been maintained and operated in compliance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and other applicable Laws (whether as a matter of substantive law or as necessary to secure favorable tax treatment), except with respect to matters that have not had or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or is comprised of a master or prototype plan that has received a favorable opinion letter upon which the Company is entitled to rely under applicable Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") procedures, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination letter, from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred as to each which has resulted or which could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or which requires or could require action under the compliance resolution programs of the IRS to preserve such qualification. Except as has not had or would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of the Company any person who is a party in interest in respect of any ERISA Plan within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, has engaged in a prohibited transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that would subject the Company or any Subsidiary directly or indirectly to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Except as has not had or would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

   

 (c) No Benefit Plan is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan. 

   

 (d) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Action relating to the Benefit Plans which is reasonably likely to result in material liability, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any such Action. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for welfare benefits subsequent to termination of employment to employees or their beneficiaries under any Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement except as required by applicable Laws. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (e) Except for violations that would not be material, neither the execution of this Agreement, the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether individually or in combination with any other event (regardless of whether that other event has occurred or will occur), will (i) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of or increase in compensation or benefits under any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans or any Contract or arrangement that would not be deductible or which deduction will be deferred under Section 162, Section 404 or Section 280G of the Code or would reimburse any Person for any excise or additional Taxes under Section 4999 or (iv) result in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (without regard to the exception set forth in Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). 

   

 (f) No liability (contingent or otherwise) to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or any Multiemployer Plan has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (other than insurance premiums satisfied in due course). The Company has not announced its intention, or undertaken (whether or not legally bound) to modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or adopt any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the definition of a Benefit Plan. The Company has not undertaken to maintain any Benefit Plan for any period of time and each such Benefit Plan is terminable at the sole discretion of the sponsor thereof, subject only to such constraints as may imposed by applicable law, and without penalty or cost (other than routine administrative costs). The Company has no material liability, including under any Benefit Plan, arising out of the treatment of any service provider as a consultant or independent contractor and not as an employee, or vice versa. 

   

 (g) With respect to each Benefit Plan for which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full and timely payment in all material respects has been made of all amounts required of the Company, under the terms of each such Benefit Plan or applicable law (determined without regard to any waiver of legally applicable funding requirements), as applied through the date of Closing. The fair market value of the assets of each such Benefit Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan year of that Benefit Plan, equals or exceeded the present value of all benefits liabilities under that Benefit Plan in all material respects. None of the assets of any Benefit Plan include any capital stock or other securities issued by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. 

   

 (h) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit Plan subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment; (ii) is fully funded and has been fully accrued for on the Companys financial statements; and (iii) if required to be registered, has been registered with the appropriate authorities and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate regulatory authorities. 

   

 (i) Except as would not reasonably be likely to result in material liability, since December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2008, each plan, program, arrangement or agreement that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of 

      ##### 

  

    

Section 409A of the Code has been operated and maintained in accordance with a
good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and its
purpose with respect to amounts deferred (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) after December 31, 2004, and (ii) by December 31, 2008, each
plan, program, arrangement or agreement identified or required to
be identified on _Section 5.9(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter has been
amended to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A of
the Code and the final regulations promulgated thereunder.

No petition, Action, notice of violation or apparent liability, notice of forfeiture, order to show cause or complaint seeking to revoke, reconsider the grant of, cancel, suspend, or modify any of the material Licenses is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened before any Governmental Entity. Since January 1, 2010, no written notices have been received by and, no claims have been filed by any Governmental Entity against or to the Knowledge of the Company threatened against, the Company or its Subsidiaries alleging a failure to hold any material requisite permits, regulatory approvals, licenses or other authorizations. 

   

 (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all material permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct their respective businesses as presently conducted.

The Licenses are sufficient and adequate in all material respects to permit the continued lawful conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, and none of the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries is being conducted in a manner that violates in any material respects any of the terms or conditions under which any License was granted.

negotiations, (C) after having

above, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (x) in each such case referred to in _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_  above, the

the Acceptance Time, the Company Board of Directors may (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation with respect to a
Superior Proposal, (B) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Alternative Transaction with respect to a Superior Proposal, or (C) cause the
Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, if in each case of (A) through (C), the Company Board of
Directors 

      ##### 

  

    

determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not effect any Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(1)_
unless and until after at least two (2) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_
") following Parents receipt of notice from the Company advising that the
Company Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal that may lead to a Superior Proposal (the " _Determination Notice_
"), the Company shall have given Parent the opportunity to meet with the
Companys Representatives during the Notice Period, the Companys
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during the
Notice Period and the Parent does not make a proposal during the Notice
Period that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
of Directors (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor), permit the Company Board of Directors to maintain the Company
Recommendation and not make a Change of Recommendation or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, as applicable, and the Company has not breached _Section
7.2_ in any material respect or breached _Section 7.2(b)_. The Determination

   _Section 7.2(b)_ or constitute a Change of Recommendation. 

  

 (d) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations between the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also shall promptly (and in any event on or before the second Business Day following the date of this Agreement) request each Person that executed a confidentiality agreement in the past six (6) months in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). At the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent executed resolutions of
the Company Board of Directors authorizing such termination. 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any representative of any such employee, or any Governmental Entity or other third party any rights, claims, benefits, causes of actions or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of employment, of any nature whatsoever, (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of employment of any Company Employee, including the amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement, after the Effective Time or (iii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement.

 (b) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that 

   ##### 

  

 

after the Closing Date in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually
in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid
by the Company for such insurance prior to the date hereof in respect of
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto (the " _Insurance Amount_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu of the foregoing, the Company may

 (c) _Section 16 Matters_. The Company Board of Directors shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of the Shares or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such Shares by an individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this proviso, Parent shall
be relieved of any obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee). In no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one

(including _Section 10.5_), each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that if the Termination Fee
becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section 9.3_,
the right to receive the Termination Fee shall constitute each of Parents
and Merger Subs and each of their Affiliates and Representatives sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement.

shall not have complied with such Divestiture Request,  
   

 

and at the time of any termination pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii)
above, the condition set forth in clause (d) on Exhibit A shall have been

(the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day
funds (x) prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case of
clause (i), and (y) within five (5) Business Days after the termination, in
the case of clause (ii). In no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including _Section 10.5_), the
Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself, its shareholders and its
Affiliates that if the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, the right to receive the Parent

 (c) The parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
