contemplated by this Agreement. CEH and GSCAC each agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts and to act in good faith to take, or cause to be taken all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the provisions of Article IV of the La
Paloma LLC Agreement to be complied

principal, interest and other amounts payable in respect of the JPM Debt and
to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing or
issuance of Equity Securities, without the consent of GSCAC except as
provided below. CEH agrees to deliver to GSCAC prompt written notice
advising GSCAC of the material terms and conditions of any potential
Permitted Refinancing Transaction that CEH is seriously considering; and CEH

(C) any such Equity Securities shall, at the Effective Time, by their terms
and pursuant to Section 3.01(a), be cancelled and automatically converted
solely into a portion of the CEH Group Merger Consideration in accordance

be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

(iii) If CEH or any Project Company proposes to enter into any definitive
agreement at any time after September 15, 2008 with respect to any incurrence
of debt for borrowed money or issuance of Equity Securities in exchange for,
of the proceeds of which are to be used to refinance, any principal, interest
or other amount payable in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 54 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect of the JPM Debt, then CEH agrees to deliver to GSCAC copies of any
final termsheet and the proposed definitive agreements and such notice shall
specify that it is being delivered pursuant to this Section 6.05(a)(iii).
Upon receipt of such notice, GSCAC shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Article IX by delivering written notice of such
termination to CEH on or prior to the fifth Business Day following GSCAC's
receipt of such notice relating to such proposal. If GSCAC does not terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence on or
prior to such fifth Business Day, then GSCAC shall be deemed to have
consented to the incurrence of such debt or issuance of such Equity
Securities and the execution and delivery by CEH and/or any Project Company
of such definitive documents and this Agreement shall be deemed to be
automatically amended and modified to permit such requested action without
any requirement for written consent thereto or any other action by any Party.

 

 

(iv) If any of the material final terms or conditions of any such debt for
borrowed money or issuance of such Equity Securities differs in any material
respects from the provisions of the proposal delivered pursuant to Section
6.03(a)(iii), CEH shall again provide written notice pursuant to Section
6.03(a)(iii) and GSCAC shall again have a right to terminate this agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.03(a)(iii).

 

 

(b) CEH shall not, directly or indirectly, pay any cash or other dividends or

(a) If during the Interim Period any of the Purchased Assets are damaged or
destroyed by any casualty event or are taken by any condemnation event, then
CEH shall prepare (or if GSCAC objects to CEH's estimate within 5 Business

independent firm reasonably acceptable to CEH and GSCAC prepare) within 15 to
45 days following such event (as such number of days is requested by CEH) (i)

the Purchased Assets damaged or destroyed by such event to a condition
reasonably comparable to their condition immediately prior to such casualty
event plus (B) the amount of any lost profits with respect to such Purchased
Assets reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a result of such
casualty event, or (ii) in the case of such a condemnation event, the
condemnation value therefor, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) net of and

award or other third party proceeds reasonably expected to be available to
the applicable Project Company for such event, (2) any amounts expended by
the applicable Project Company prior to Closing to restore damage caused by
such casualty event and (3) adjustments relating to such casualty event or
condemnation event that result in a reduction to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 55 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Designated Cash Account Balances that would otherwise exist at Closing
(as applicable, such estimate being a "Casualty Estimate"). Any Casualty
Estimate shall be prepared based on the best reasonably available information
as of the date of such Casualty Estimate and if the Closing is expected to
occur prior to the end of the 15 to 45 day period referenced above (as such
number of days is requested by CEH pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section), then the determination of such Casualty Estimate shall not delay,
impair or otherwise affect the Closing except that the Closing Date shall be
extended, if necessary, to the earlier of (x) third Business Day after such
Casualty Estimate is made and (y) the 5th day following the 15 to 45 day
period (as requested by CEH pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
6.07) following such casualty event or condemnation event.

 

 

(b) If the Casualty Estimate with respect to all such casualty or
condemnation events is greater than $3,000,000 but does not exceed
$25,000,000, then the LP Enterprise Value (in the case of a Casualty Estimate
with respect to the La Paloma Project) or the BV Enterprise Value (in the
case of a Casualty Estimate with respect to the Batesville Project) set forth
on Exhibit F shall be reduced by an amount equal to such Casualty Estimate
minus $3,000,000, in which case CEH and its Affiliates shall have no further
liability hereunder due to such casualty or condemnation event and such
casualty or condemnation event shall not otherwise affect the Closing.

 

 

(c) If the Casualty Estimate with respect to all such casualty or
condemnation events is greater than $25,000,000, GSCAC may, by written notice
to CEH before the expected Closing Date, elect to (i) reduce the LP
Enterprise Value (in the case of a Casualty Estimate with respect to the La
Paloma Project) or the BV Enterprise Value (in the case of a Casualty
Estimate with respect to the Batesville Project) set forth on Exhibit F by
an amount equal to such Casualty Estimate minus $3,000,000, in which case
CEH and its Affiliates shall have no further liability hereunder due to such
casualty or condemnation event and such casualty or condemnation event shall
not otherwise affect the Closing, or (ii) terminate this Agreement; provided,
however, that if GSCAC does not elect to terminate this Agreement as provided
in this sentence, then CEH may, by written notice to GSCAC on or before the
expected Closing Date (or, if later, 50 days after the date of such casualty
or condemnation event but prior to the Closing Date), terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Article IX.

 

 

(d) If the Casualty Estimate with respect to all such casualty or
condemnation events is $3,000,000 or less, (i) neither GSCAC nor CEH shall
have the right or option to terminate this Agreement as a result of such
casualty or condemnation event, (ii) there shall be no reduction in the
amount of the LP Enterprise Value or the BV Enterprise Value set forth on
Exhibit F with respect to such casualty or condemnation event; and (iii) such
casualty or condemnation event shall not delay, impair or otherwise affect
the Closing; and (iv) there shall be no liability for GSCAC, CEH or any of
their respective Affiliates hereunder due to such casualty or condemnation
event.

 

 

Section 6.08   Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Except as provided in this Section 6.08(a), GSCAC shall prepare and file
(or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax returns relating to any Project
Company that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to
any income Tax returns covering a taxable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 56 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date with respect to any Project Company (other than
Batesville Investor I, Batesville Investor II, LSP Energy, Inc. and LSP
Batesville Funding Corporation) CEH shall cause such Tax returns to be
prepared and filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority. GSCAC agrees to
cause the income, gain, loss and deduction of CEP Batesville Acquisition for
the taxable year that includes the Closing Date to be allocated between CEH
and GSCAC under Section 706 of the Code using a closing of the books on the
Closing Date.

 

 

(b) After the Closing, GSCAC shall grant or cause the Project Companies to
grant to CEH (or its respective designees) access at all reasonable times to
all of the information, books and records relating to the Project Companies
within the possession of GSCAC (including workpapers and correspondence with
Taxing Authorities) and to the employees of the Project Companies, and shall
afford CEH (or its designees) the right (at CEH's expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit CEH (or its designee) to prepare Tax returns, respond to Tax audits
and investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund claims and to
conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. After the Closing, CEH and
GSCAC will preserve (and GSCAC will cause all Project Companies to preserve)
all information, records or documents in their respective possessions
relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Project Companies until six months
after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions thereof) with respect to the assessment of such Taxes; provided,
that no Party shall dispose of any of the foregoing items without first
offering such items to the other Parties. GSCAC agrees to make the election
referred to in Section 754 of the Code with respect to Holdco Sub and any
entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes in which it
has a direct or indirect interest. The Parties understand that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will give rise to special
allocations under Section 704(c) of the Code (or to analogous "reverse 704(c)
allocations") and agree that, with respect to such allocations, Holdco Sub
will utilize "remedial method" for allocations with respect to contributed
property subject to Code Section 197 and the "traditional method with
curative allocations" for all other items of property, pursuant to Section

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement and
GSCAC's receipt from CEH of any information regarding the Project Companies
that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement, GSCAC will prepare
and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC; provided that GSCAC
shall furnish a draft of such preliminary Proxy Statement to CEH and give CEH
and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such draft prior to
filing the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC and shall accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by CEH in
connection therewith. GSCAC shall promptly notify CEH of the receipt of
any comments of the SEC staff with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to CEH as promptly as reasonably
practicable, copies of all written correspondence between GSCAC or any
representative of GSCAC and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If
comments are received from the SEC staff with respect to the Proxy Statement,
GSCAC shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable after its receipt
from CEH of any information regarding the Project Companies that is required
to address such comments and GSCAC will use its reasonable best efforts to
mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders as soon as reasonably
practicable following its approval by the SEC. GSCAC shall provide CEH and
its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review any amendment or
supplement to each of the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement
prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by CEH in connection therewith. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement and GSCAC's receipt from
CEH of any information regarding the Project Companies that is required to be
included, GSCAC will prepare and file any other filings required under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other Federal, foreign or Blue Sky
Laws relating to the Transaction or any regulations of any exchange on which
the common stock, par value $0.001 per share of GSCAC is listed for trading
(collectively, the "Other Filings"). GSCAC will notify CEH promptly of any
request by the SEC or its staff or any other governmental officials for
amendments or supplements to any Other Filing or for other additional
information and will supply CEH with copies of all written correspondence
between GSCAC or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and such
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to any Other Filing.
GSCAC agrees that the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings will comply in
all material respects with all applicable Laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Filing, CEH or GSCAC as the case may be, will promptly inform the other Party
of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to GSCAC Stockholders, such amendment
or supplement. The Proxy Statement will be sent to the GSCAC Stockholders
for the purpose of soliciting proxies from GSCAC Stockholders to vote in
favor of (i) the Initial Business Combination contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the issuance and sale of the GSCAC Class B Common Stock and the GSCAC
Class A Common Stock (including GSCAC Class A Common Stock into which
the Holdco Class B Common Units may be exchanged); (iii) the adoption of the

(b) As soon as practicable after mailing the Proxy Statement to the GSCAC
Stockholders, GSCAC shall call, convene and hold a meeting of the GSCAC
Stockholders (the "GSCAC Stockholders' Meeting") and solicit proxies from
such holders to vote in favor of the approval of the Transaction and the
other Voting Matters. GSCAC's obligation to call, convene and hold such
meeting shall not be affected by any Change in Recommendation by the GSCAC
Board unless this Agreement is terminated by CEH pursuant to Article IX.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, GSCAC
shall adjourn or postpone the GSCAC Stockholders' Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the GSCAC Stockholders or, if as of the time
for which the GSCAC Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of GSCAC Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such meeting.

 

 

(c) CEH agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide GSCAC with all
information concerning the Project Companies as is reasonably requested by
GSCAC for the information concerning the Project Companies in the Proxy
Statement to comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under the
Exchange Act or requirements of AMEX in the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of proxies thereunder,
and the calling and holding of the GSCAC Stockholders' Meeting or as may be
reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. GSCAC shall ensure
that the Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which it is distributed
to the GSCAC Stockholders, and as of the date of the GSCAC Stockholders'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that GSCAC
shall not be responsible for ensuring that any information furnished by CEH
in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading). With respect to the information furnished by
CEH in writing with respect to the Project Companies for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, CEH shall ensure that the Proxy Statement does not, as of
the date on which it is distributed to the GSCAC Stockholders, and as of the
date of the GSCAC Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading (provided that CEH shall not be responsible for ensuring that
any information furnished by a GSCAC Party in writing for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading).

 

 

(d) Subject to Section 6.13 but without limiting Section 6.09(b), the GSCAC
Board shall recommend that the GSCAC Stockholders vote in favor of approval
of the Transactions and the other Voting Matters, and GSCAC, acting through
its board of directors, shall include in the Proxy Statement such
recommendation, and shall otherwise use all reasonable best efforts to obtain

Section 6.11   Public Disclosure. The Parties agree that no public release
or announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions shall be issued
by any Party or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives without the prior consent of GSCAC and CEH, unless such Party
determines that it is required by any Laws or by the rules and regulations
of, or pursuant to any agreement with, a stock exchange or trading system. If
any Party determines that it is required by any Laws or by the rules and
regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement with, a stock exchange or
trading system, to make this Agreement and the terms of the Transaction
public or otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with
respect thereto, it shall, to the extent permitted by Law, at a reasonable
time before making any public disclosure, consult with the other Party
regarding such disclosure and give the other Party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. This provision
will not apply to communications by any Party to any of its counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors or its directors, officers,
partners, members, equityholders, or employees. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, GSCAC will prepare and file a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act (which Current Report shall
be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to CEH) to report the
execution of this Agreement. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
GSCAC and CEH shall also prepare and issue a joint press release announcing

form acceptable to CEH that shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for 6 years following the Closing Date of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous
with respect to claims arising from facts and events that occurred prior to
the Closing Date. If GSCAC or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfer or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or assets
to any Person, then, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of GSCAC assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.12. The provisions of this Section
6.12 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Person who will have been a director or officer of CEH for all periods ending
on or before the Closing Date and may not be changed without the consent of
the CEH Founders.

 

 

Section 6.13   Exclusivity. (a) Except in connection with a Permitted
Refinancing Transaction or a Permitted CEH Strategic Discussion, and without

Party to enter into this Agreement, none of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 60 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GSCAC Parties or CEH, or their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate discussions with, enter
into negotiations or agreements with, or furnish any information about
themselves, or otherwise assist, facilitate or encourage, any Person or group
(other than Parties to this Agreement, or their authorized Representatives)
concerning any proposal for a merger, sale or purchase of substantial assets,
sale or purchase of shares of capital stock or other securities,
recapitalization or other business combination transaction involving a GSCAC
Party or any Project Companies on the one hand and any third party on the
other hand. Each of the GSCAC Parties and CEH agrees, and CEH agrees to cause
the Project Companies, to instruct their respective Representatives not to
take any action contrary to the provisions of the previous sentence. Each of
the GSCAC Parties and CEH agrees, and CEH agrees to cause the Project
Companies, to immediately halt any such discussions with any third parties
regarding any transaction that would be inconsistent with these exclusivity
provisions or that would interfere with, prevent or delay the consummation of
the Transactions. GSCAC and CEH will notify the other immediately in writing
if such Party becomes aware that any inquiries or proposals are received by,
any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions
are sought to be initiated with, the GSCAC Parties or Project Companies as
described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with this Section,
the GSCAC Board may make a Change in Recommendation if GSCAC receives an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the GSCAC Board determines in good
faith, after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory,
transaction timing and certainty of consummation and other aspects of such
proposal would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, constitute an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith will be more favorable and provide greater value to GSCAC's
stockholders than the Transactions (taking into account any proposal by CEH
to amend the terms of the this Agreement), or if the GSCAC Board otherwise
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 

(b) With respect to any Permitted CEH Strategic Discussions, CEH shall not,
and shall not permit any other Project Company or any of their respective
Representatives to, enter into any Contract or otherwise make any commitments
in connection with any such discussions (other than a confidentiality
agreement on customary terms), except with the consent of GSCAC, and CEH
agrees to keep GSCAC reasonably informed on a current basis of the status and
details and any material developments in any such discussions.

operations.

notify CEH if there has been a Change in Recommendation.

believes (1) in the case of GSCAC, that it is likely that the closing
conditions in Sections 8.01 or 8.02 will not be satisfied and (2) in the case
of CEH, that it is likely that the closing conditions in Sections 7.01 and
7.02 will not be satisfied.

 

 

(c) CEH agrees to notify GSCAC promptly if coverage has been denied or
disputed in any material respect by any underwriters of insurance policies or
bonds material to any Project Companies or in respect of which any such
underwriters has reserved its rights in connection with a material claim
pending under any of such insurance policies or bonds.

Agreement to the contrary during the Interim Period GSCAC agrees to deliver
to Fulcrum a binding written offer to be held open for at least 20 Business
Days to exchange all of Fulcrum's membership interests in CEP Batesville
Holding for the Fulcrum Exchange Consideration on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those set forth in Exhibit O (excluding any such
terms and conditions relating to the La Paloma LLC Agreement). Each Party
shall promptly inform the other of any communication from or to, and any

and/or exchange. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding

rejection by Fulcrum of such offer described above, (B) any matter in dispute
regarding the price or exchange consideration with respect to such offer, (C)
any negotiations, documentation or approvals to purchase Fulcrum's membership
interests in CEP Batesville Holding, or (D) the consummation or failure to
consummate for any reason the exchange contemplated by this Section shall in
any case constitute a failure of a condition to be satisfied under Article
VII or impair, delay or otherwise affect the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 62 -

such Schedules or in any representation or warranty in Article IV by
delivering to GSCAC a copy of such amendment, supplement or update

TERMINATION

 

 

Section 9.01   Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, as follows:

 

 

(a) at any time before the Closing, by CEH or GSCAC, by written notice to the

not have any cure period) has not been cured within 30 days following written
notification to GSCAC thereof; provided, however, that if, at the end of

contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for

hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of

construction and interpretation of this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\- 72 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement to arbitrate, and all other procedural aspects of the arbitration
conducted pursuant hereto shall be decided by the arbitrators. In addition:

 

 

(i) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA"). The AAA shall administer the arbitration. The arbitrators shall
resolve any Dispute in accordance with the governing law in Section 11.13 of
this Agreement.

 

 

(ii) The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of three neutral arbitrators who
have never been officers, directors or employees of, or otherwise affiliated
in any material respect within the preceding five years with, the Parties or
any of their Affiliates. GSCAC on the one hand and CEH on the other
hand shall each appoint one arbitrator and the third arbitrator who shall
chair the tribunal shall be selected by such two Party-
appointed arbitrators. In the event that one or both of GSCAC and CEH does
or do not appoint an arbitrator, or such Party-appointed arbitrators are
unable to agree upon a chair within 14 days of the appointment of the second
arbitrator, then the remaining arbitrator(s) shall be chosen in accordance
with the Rules.

 

 

(iii) The hearing will be conducted in New York, NY. The arbitrators'
decision shall be in writing and set forth the reasons for the award and
shall include an award of costs to the prevailing Party or Parties, or an
allocation of such costs among the Parties based upon the extent to which
each prevails, including the costs of the arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrators and of the AAA), reasonable attorneys' fees,
expert witness fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the
arbitration. The award shall include pre-judgment interest at a rate of 10%
per annum from the date of the breach or default. Interest shall accrue until
the date the award is paid in full. The arbitrators shall have the power to
grant interim measures, temporary or permanent injunctive or other
equitable relief.

 

 

(iv) The award shall be final and binding. The Parties agree that any
arbitration award may be enforced in any court of competent subject matter
jurisdiction and that any Party may authorize any such court to enter
judgment on the arbitrators' decisions. The Parties further agree that the
award may be enforced against the losing Party or Parties in any jurisdiction
where such losing Party or Parties has assets that may be used to satisfy
the award.

 

 

(v) Except to the extent necessary for proceedings relating to enforcement of
the arbitration agreement, the award or other, related rights of the Parties,
the fact of the arbitration, the arbitration proceeding itself, all evidence,
memorials or other documents exchanged or used in the arbitration and the
arbitrators' award shall be maintained in confidence by the Parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law. However, a violation of this
covenant shall not affect the enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate
or of the arbitrators' award.

misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that
such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or
to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.
The listing of information or other items under one Schedule to a
representation or warranty made herein shall be deemed adequate to disclose

Section 11.07   No Third Party Beneficiary. Except for the provisions of
Section 6.06 and Section 6.12 (which are intended to be for the benefit of
the Persons identified therein), the terms and provisions of this

Section 11.08   Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party without
the prior written consent of GSCAC (in the case of an assignment by CEH) or
CEH (in the case of an assignment by GSCAC), and any attempt to do so will be

circumstance is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any
present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, such provision will be fully severable, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will be construed and enforced
as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a
part hereof, the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents will remain in full force and effect and will not
be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom.

 

 

Section 11.11   Waiver of Claims Against the Trust Account. (a) CEH
understands that GSCAC is a recently organized blank check company formed for
the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses or assets. CEH further
understands that GSCAC's sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of
the recent initial public offering (the "IPO") and private placement of its
securities, and that substantially all of those proceeds have been
deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of GSCAC, its public
stockholders (as defined in the Trust Agreement) and the underwriters of its
IPO. CEH acknowledges that monies in the Trust Account may be disbursed only
(1) to GSCAC in limited amounts from time to time (and in no event more than
$2,400,000 in total) in order to permit GSCAC to pay its operating expenses;
(2) if the Company completes an Initial Business Combination (as defined in
its Charter Documents), to certain dissenting public stockholders, to the
underwriters in the amount of underwriting discounts and commissions they
earned in the IPO but whose payment they have deferred, and then to GSCAC;
and (3) if GSCAC fails to complete an Initial Business Combination within the
allotted time period and liquidates subject to the terms of the Trust
Agreement, to GSCAC in limited amounts to permit GSCAC to pay the costs and
expenses of its liquidation and dissolution and then to GSCAC's public
stockholders.

 

 

(b) For and in consideration of this Agreement, CEH hereby agrees to waive
any Claim of any kind that CEH has or may have in the future in or to any
monies in the Trust Account and not to seek recourse against the Trust
