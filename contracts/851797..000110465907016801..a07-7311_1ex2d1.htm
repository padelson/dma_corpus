# **ARTICLE II. 
 CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER**

  

## _Section 2.1 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares. _The manner of
converting or canceling shares of the Company and Merger Sub in the Merger
shall be as follows:

  

### (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each share (a " _Share_ ") of the Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Companies_ ") or in the treasury of the Company, and (ii) Shares which are
held by stockholders properly demanding and perfecting (and not having
effectively withdrawn) appraisal rights with respect to such Shares pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive, without interest, $27.00 **** (the " _Per Share
Consideration_ "). Each such Share, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Share shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Share, except the right to receive the Per Share
Consideration for such Share upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.3_ or the right, if any, in the case of holders of
Dissenting Shares, to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation of such
amount as may be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL.

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each Share issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time and

        

### owned by any of the Purchaser Companies, and each Share issued and held
in the CompanyÂ’s treasury at the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be canceled and be retired without payment of any consideration
therefor and cease to exist.

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall  be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## _Section 2.2 Dissenting Shares. _Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Consideration,
unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL.
Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL.  If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holderÂ’s Shares
shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right
to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such
right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired,
the Per Share Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Purchaser and Merger Sub (a) prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  

## _Section 2.3 Payment for Shares in the Merger. _The manner of
making payment for Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:

  

### (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
deposit in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares with a bank or
trust company designated by Purchaser and approved by the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), cash in United States dollars in an aggregate amount equal
to the sum of the product of (A) the number of Shares issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by the Purchaser Companies,
Shares held by the Company in treasury and Dissenting Shares) and (B) the Per
Share Consideration (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ ").  The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided for in
_Section 2.1_  of this Agreement out of the Payment Fund.

  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail or
otherwise make available to each record holder (other than the Purchaser
Companies, the Company and holders of Dissenting Shares), as of the Effective
Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates,

        

### which immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") a form letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary
form, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
for payments therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereon, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate and
(ii) the Per Share Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it may be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or that such person shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.3_ , each Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares or Shares owned by any of the Purchaser Companies or the
Company ) shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive the
Per Share Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced
by such Certificate, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 2.3_ , (x) Purchaser shall, as promptly as
is reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing), deliver to the Principal
Stockholders such letter of transmittal and instructions for use as would be
required of holders of Certificates pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 2.3(b)_ and (y) so long as the Principal Stockholders complete such
transmittal materials and deliver them to Purchaser at or prior to the
Closing (it being understood and agreed that if Purchaser shall fail to
deliver such transmittal materials to the Principal Stockholders no later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing then in such event such
letter of transmittal shall not be required to be completed by the Principal
Stockholders), Purchaser shall pay and deduct from the Payment Fund, or cause
the Paying Agent to pay, to the Principal Stockholders immediately after the
Effective Time by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Per Share
Consideration payable with respect to the Shares owned beneficially and of
record by the Principal Stockholders upon surrender of the Certificates
representing such Shares.

  

### (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company following the date which is two hundred seventy
(270) days after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with _Section 2.3(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof, for payment of
their claim for the Per Share Consideration for Shares, without any interest
thereon. Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder of Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or
otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as shall

        

### be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law),
any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. The Paying Agent shall retain the right
to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation (or the Purchaser, if applicable) in securities issued or
guaranteed by the United States government or certificates of deposit of
commercial banks that have, or are members of a group of commercial banks
that has, consolidated total assets of not less than $500,000,000 and the
Surviving Corporation (or the Purchaser, if applicable) shall receive the
interest earned thereon or money market funds which are invested in the
foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment, or any loss
realized with respect to any such investment, will relieve Purchaser or
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, from paying in full the Per Share
Consideration, in accordance with the terms hereof, to each holder of Shares
who complies with the terms hereof.

  

### (d) Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, if applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from
(i) the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares or (ii) any other payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_
, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be (i) paid
by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable tax authorities when due and
(ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

## _Section 2.4 Treatment of Equity-Based Awards._

  

### (a) The Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ ") granted under the
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 2.4(a)_ that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be canceled, and the holder of such Options (to the extent
listed on _Schedule 2.4(a)_  and then outstanding and unexercised, whether
vested or becoming vested prior to or upon the Effective Time) shall receive,
at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable after (but in no event later
than five (5) days after the Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation,
in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such Option and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration over the exercise price
per Share previously subject to such Option, less any required withholding
taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be (i) paid by the Surviving Corporation to the
applicable tax authorities when due and (ii) treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Persons in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

        

### (b) The Company shall take any actions reasonably necessary to effectuate
the cancellation of the Options to be effective as of the Effective Time (but
without derogation of the rights of the holders of Options to receive the
amounts specified in _Section 2.4(a)_ ); it being understood that the
intention of the parties is that following the Effective Time no holder of an
Option or any participant in any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) or derivative securities of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company, to the extent required under the Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans, shall deliver to the holders of the Options appropriate
notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, setting
forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to this Agreement

  

## _Section 2.5 Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate is claimed to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will, subject to the applicable terms and
conditions of this Agreement, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

## _Section 2.6 No Further Rights of Transfer. _At and after the
Effective Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law and except for, in the case of a holder of a Certificate (other than
Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof or Dissenting Shares),
the right to surrender his or her Certificate in exchange for payment of the
Per Share Consideration, and no transfer of Shares shall be made on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.  Certificates presented
to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time shall be canceled and
exchanged for cash as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ , subject to applicable
Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. At the close of business on the day of
the Effective Time the stock ledger of the Company with respect to Shares
shall be closed.

Sub shall have any claim against any Person with respect thereto and that the

their respective Representatives.  Nothing in this _Section 3.30_ shall be in
derogation of or shall be deemed to modify the specific representations and
warranties made by the Company in this Agreement.

### (b) The execution and delivery by each of Purchaser and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the other instruments and agreements to be executed and
delivered by such party as contemplated hereby, the consummation of the
transactions expressly contemplated hereby and thereby to be consummated by
Purchaser or Merger Sub (other than consummation of the Merger), and the
performance by such party of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have
been duly and validly authorized by all requisite action on the part of such
party. The consummation of the Merger has been duly and validly authorized by
all requisite corporate action on the part of Purchaser and Merger Sub,
subject to obtaining Parent Shareholder Approval. This Agreement and the other
instruments and agreements to be executed and delivered by either Purchaser
or Merger Sub as contemplated hereby have been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each such party and constitute, assuming the due and valid
execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto (other than
Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates), valid and
binding obligations of each such party enforceable against it in accordance
with their terms subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of equity.

  

### (c) The Rights Issue has been duly and validly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of Parent, except for the Parent
Shareholder Approval.

## _Section 4.3 Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Purchaser and Merger Sub and the consummation of the
transactions expressly contemplated hereby by Purchaser and Merger Sub do not

consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, filings or notifications, the
failure of which to make or obtain under this clause (vii) would not prevent
or materially delay Purchaser or Merger Sub from performing their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the other instruments and agreements to
be executed and delivered by such party as contemplated hereby or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions expressly contemplated
hereby.

  

## _Section 4.4 Ownership_  _of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub (i) has not conducted, and
will not prior to the Effective Time conduct, any business (ii) has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets or liabilities except in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of
Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries owns
(beneficially or of record) any Shares, and none of Parent, Purchaser or
Merger Sub or any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of any Shares, except this Agreement and the StockholdersÂ’
Agreements.

  

## _Section 4.5 Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding,
at law or in equity, by any Person pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser

and delivered by such party as contemplated hereby or the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions expressly contemplated hereby.

  

## _Section 4.6 No Brokers_. Other than N M Rothschild and Sons Limited and
Merrill Lynch International or in connection with the Financing Agreements,
neither Parent, Purchaser nor Merger Sub nor any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries has
(i) employed or engaged any broker, investment banker, agent or finder or

or findersÂ’ fees or expenses, payable by Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub or
any Subsidiary thereof in connection with the transactions expressly
contemplated hereby.

  

## _Section 4.7 Financing_ _._

  

### (a) _Facility Agreement_. The Purchaser has provided to the Company true,
complete and correct executed copies of the Revolving Facilities Agreement
listed on _Schedule 4.7(a)_ (the " _Facility Agreement_ ") to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the portion referenced therein as the
Tranche A portion of the Facility Agreement (the " _Tranche A Facility_ ")
will constitute the debt financing required for consummation of the Merger
and payment of the other amounts payable at or prior to the Closing by
Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to consummate

        

### the transactions expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the
Guaranty, as applicable. Pursuant to the Tranche A Facility, the parties
referred to in the Facility Agreement as the "Banks" (the " _Lenders_ ") have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide or
cause to be provided a maximum principal amount of $1,170,000,000 to Parent
in connection with the transactions expressly contemplated hereby. Neither
of Purchaser or Merger Sub shall, without the prior written consent of
the Company, agree to, or permit any of its Affiliates to agree to, any
amendment or modification of the Tranche A Facility that (i) reduces the
aggregate commitments of the Lenders thereunder to an aggregate amount below
an amount, when combined with other amounts available to Purchaser, required
for consummation of the Merger and payment of the other amounts payable at or
prior to the Closing by Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation to consummate the Merger and the transactions expressly
contemplated hereby to be effected at the Closing (which amounts shall be
deemed to include for purposes of this Agreement amounts due under _Section
2.4(a)_ ), or pay the other amounts payable by the Parent, Purchaser, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions
expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the Guaranty, as applicable,
(ii) amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the availability
of the commitments provided by the Lenders in a manner that is more onerous
or burdensome to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub to obtain the Tranche A
Facility provided for in the Facility Agreement, (iii) changes the identity
of any of the Lenders (except as provided in the Facility Agreement), or (iv)
materially and adversely affects the ability of Parent, Purchaser or Merger
Sub to receive the portion of the Tranche A Facility required to consummate
the Merger and the transactions expressly contemplated hereby to be effected
at the Closing or pay the other amounts payable at or prior to the Closing by
the Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the transactions expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the
Guaranty, as applicable.

  

### (b) _Equity Agreements_. The Purchaser has provided to the Company
a true, complete and correct copy of the underwriting agreement listed in
_Schedule 4.7(b)_ (the " _Underwriting Agreement_ " and together with the
Facility Agreement, the " _Financing Agreements_ ") to which Parent is a
party and which will be used in connection with the equity financing required
for consummation of the Merger and payment of the other amounts payable by
Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to consummate the
transactions expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the Guaranty, as
applicable. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the underwriters thereto
(the " _Underwriters_ ") have agreed to procure subscribers for non-accepted
shares of Parent in the Rights Issue on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, which Rights Issue
(together with any amounts paid to Parent by the Underwriters) will provide,
subject to such terms and conditions, aggregate net proceeds of approximately
Â£400,000,000 to Parent (the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with the
portion of the Tranche A Facility required to consummate the closing of the
Merger and the other transactions expressly contemplated hereby to be
effected at the Closing, the " _Parent Financing_ "). Purchaser shall cause
Parent not to, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to any
amendment or modification of the Underwriting Agreement that (i) amends or
modifies any of the conditions precedent to the Rights Issue, (ii) reduces
the Equity Financing or the aggregate commitments of the

        

### Underwriters thereunder to an aggregate amount below an amount, when
combined with other amounts available to Purchaser, required for consummation
of the Merger and payment of the other amounts payable at or prior to the
Closing by Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions expressly contemplated
hereby to be effected at the Closing, or pay the other amounts payable at or
prior to the Closing by the Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the transactions expressly contemplated hereby
or pursuant to the Guaranty, as applicable, (iii) changes the identity of any
of the Underwriters (except as provided in the Underwriting Agreement) or
(iv) materially and adversely affects the ability of Purchaser or Merger Sub
to receive the Equity Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions expressly contemplated hereby to be effected at the
Closing.

  

### (c) _Financing Agreements_. The Financing Agreements are in full
force and effect, are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and
its Subsidiaries that are a party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
the other parties thereto subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity, are not subject to any conditions or contingencies
other than those contained therein, and constitute the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof (and there are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for
reasonable and customary fee letters and engagement letters that do not
materially and adversely affect the obligations of the providers of the debt
and equity financing set forth in the Financing Agreements) relating to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Parent
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by, the
Financing Agreements).  None of the Financing Agreements have been modified
or amended, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a breach by Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub
under any term or condition of any of the Financing Agreements and to the
Knowledge of Purchaser or Merger Sub, the commitments and/or agreements
contained in the Financing Agreements have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any material respect. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Financing Agreements, none of Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub (w) are
aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions in any of
the Financing Agreements inaccurate, (x) have any reason to believe they will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by any of them contained in any of the Financing Agreements, or (y)
have any reason to believe that (i) the Equity Financing (when cumulated with
the Tranche A Facility) required to consummate the Merger or pay the
other amounts payable at or prior to the Closing by the Parent, Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions
expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the Guaranty, as applicable,
will not be made available to Parent not later than April 27, 2007 (the "
_Equity Financing Date_ ") and (ii) the Tranche A Facility (when cumulated
with the Equity Financing) required to consummate the Merger or pay the other
amounts payable at or prior to the Closing by the Parent, Purchaser, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions
expressly contemplated hereby or pursuant to the Guaranty, as applicable will
not be made available to Parent at or prior to the Effective Time. Each of
Purchaser

        

### and Merger Sub on behalf of themselves and on behalf of Parent
acknowledge that their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
ParentÂ’s obligations under the Guaranty are not conditioned upon or subject
to receipt by any of them of the proceeds made available under the Financing
Agreements or any other financing, in each case subject to and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 7.2(d)_ or _7.2(e)_ hereof.  Assuming
satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in the Financing
Agreements, at the Closing, the proceeds contemplated by the Financing
Agreements will be sufficient to enable Purchaser and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to
be effected at the Closing, and to pay all fees and expenses in
connection therewith (including, without limitation, the payment of the
Payment Funds, the fees and expenses payable at or prior to such time related
to the Parent Financing, and the principal amount and unpaid interest
outstanding under the CompanyÂ’s Credit Agreement, subject to the CompanyÂ’s
compliance with _Section 5.2(a)(iii)_ with respect to the Credit Agreement,
the satisfaction of the CompanyÂ’s obligations, if any, under the Debt Tender
Offer, if any, and the satisfaction of the CompanyÂ’s obligations at or prior
to the Closing under the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation, if the
same shall be commenced prior to or at the Effective Time).

  

## _Section 4.8 Solvency_. Immediately following the Closing, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent (assuming for
the purposes of this representation that the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries was Solvent immediately prior to the Closing).

  

## _Section 4.9 Proxy Statement Information; Other Filings_.
The information provided by Purchaser or Merger Sub relating to Purchaser,
Merger Sub, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent expressly for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed and
at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Any
such information that is to be so provided or so confirmed shall be
specifically identified and agreed upon in writing, in advance, by the
Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub. No Other Filing made by Parent, Purchaser
or Merger Sub with the SEC will, at the time of filing thereof, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

## _Section 4.10 Export Controls_. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, no
director, officer or employee of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
appears on (i) the List of SDNs maintained by OFAC; (ii) the Bureau of
Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce
"Denied Persons List," "Entity List" or "Unverified List"; or (iii) the
Office of Defense Trade Controls of the United States Department of State

Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is involved in business arrangements or
transactions with or involving countries subject to economic or trade
sanctions imposed by the United States Government, or with or involving SDNs
in violation of the regulations maintained by OFAC.

  

## _Section 4.11 No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the
StockholdersÂ’ Agreements and the Guaranty, the

        

## Company acknowledges that none of Purchaser, Merger Sub nor any other
Person on behalf of the Purchaser or Merger Sub has made or is making any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent,
Purchaser, Merger Sub, any of ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, or with respect to any other information provided to the Company.
Except with respect to information provided by Purchaser or Merger Sub
relating to Purchaser, Merger Sub, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, none of Parent, Purchaser,
Merger Sub nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to the Company or, insofar as the parties are
concerned, any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Company,
or use by the Company of, any such information, including without limitation
any information, documents or other material made available to the Company,
unless and then only to the extent that any such information is expressly
included in a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules or in a certificate delivered by the Purchaser
in connection with the Closing.

not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event will any provision hereof obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
representatives to provide Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of ParentÂ’s
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or

to the provision of such information, directly or indirectly, in a manner
consistent with applicable Law.

  

## _Section 5.2 Conduct of Business_.

Company shall promptly notify Purchaser when an Excluded Party ceases to be

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section

and (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith that such action is required to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish public and non-
public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making

        

### such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its counsel
and financial advisors regarding such Acquisition Proposal (as then amended
or supplemented);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not,
will not allow its Subsidiaries to, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Person without
first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will,
subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in _Section 5.1(c)_, promptly

following, whichever is later) notify Purchaser in the event that the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition
Proposal or written indication by any Person that it is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request by any Person for non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other
than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and
reasonably believed by the Company to be unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal
or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal by any Person. Following the Notice Date, the Company
shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a current
basis (and in any event within 48 hours after or, if later, the immediately
following Business Day after the occurrence of any significant changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Acquisition
Proposal (including any Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party),
indication, inquiry or request (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and of any material modification thereto), and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of
any material written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and

cause each of its

        

### Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of,
or grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and upon the
written request of Purchaser, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the
provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ Â¸ that the Company
may permit a proposal to be made under a standstill agreement if it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
actions are necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. To the
extent that prior to the date hereof the Company has entered into any
confidentiality agreement that would prevent the Company from providing
information to Purchaser that the Company would otherwise be required to
provide to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.3(c)_ , the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of such
confidentiality agreement to enable the Company to provide such information
to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this _Section 5.3(c)_.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.3(b)(ii)_ to the contrary, if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be
offered by Purchaser including pursuant to _clause (ii)_ below, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Vote, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such action is required to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation (a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ "), (y) approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal, and/or (z) terminate this Agreement
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing _clause (z)_ , and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing _clause (z)_ shall be void and of no force or
effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the
Company pays the Break-Up Fee and the Purchaser Expenses, by wire transfer of
same day funds (without derogation of any of the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder)
and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section 5.3(c)(iii)_ ; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to the foregoing _clause
(x)_ , approve or recommend such Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing
_clause (y)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing _clause
(z)_ unless (A) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the
Company of this _Section 5.3_ and (B):

  

#### (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and
Purchaser, at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_
"), of its taking any action contemplated by this _Section 5.3(e)_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall

        

#### have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents, including the then current form of the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

  

#### (ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, approving
or recommending such Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement to enter
into a proposed definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and legal counsel
to (except in the case of a termination pursuant to clause (z) of _Section
5.3(e)_ on or prior to the calendar day after the Solicitation Period End
Date to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an Eligible
Acquisition Proposal which is determined to constitute a Superior Proposal
under the provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_ ), provide Purchaser the opportunity
to, submit an amended written proposal or to make a new written proposal to
the Board of Directors of the Company, during the Notice Period and negotiate
with Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Purchaser desires to negotiate)
during the Notice Period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

  

#### (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of Purchaser Expenses which
the Company is required to pay in advance or concurrently to exercise its
right under clause (z) of this _Section 5.3(e)_  shall be, at the CompanyÂ’s
option in its sole discretion, the lesser of (x) $35,000,000 or (y) the
amount invoiced by Purchaser in accordance with _Section 7.6(b)(vii)_
provided, in respect of this clause (y), it has received at least two (2)
hours prior notice of the CompanyÂ’s proposed termination of this Agreement,
in each case without limiting the CompanyÂ’s rights under
_Section 7.6(b)(vii)_ hereof.

  

In the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that
prompted the notice required by _clause (B)(i)_  of this _Section 5.3(e)_ ,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Purchaser
and to comply with the requirements of _clause (B)(ii)_ of this _Section
5.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice except that the Notice Period
shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days.

  

### (f) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 5.3_ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, legal counsel, investment bankers, accountants, or the Principal
Stockholders shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.3_ ) by the Company.

  

### (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation
of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger shall be
deemed to be a Change in Board Recommendation); or (ii) disclosing the fact
that the Board of Directors

        

### of the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such
proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that it is required to make such
disclosure in connection with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or to
comply with obligations under federal securities Laws or New York Stock
Exchange rules or the rules and regulations of any US. securities exchange
upon which the capital stock of the Company is listed.

  

### (h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other
than Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provisions of any other Law) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply.

  

### (i) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured to permit

good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors and

proposal) are more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders from a financial
point of view than this Agreement, and (y) with respect to which the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside counsel and after taking into account
all legal, financial (including the financing terms of such proposal),
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal) is reasonably likely to be
consummated (if accepted).

in _Section 5.1_ , the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its
officers, employees and representatives to provide, upon the reasonable

Solicitation Statement prepared by K and F Subsidiary in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
and the Company and otherwise in accordance with this _Section 5.6_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the closing of the Debt Tender Offer (and
the making of any payments for the Note Consents) shall be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, (ii) if so requested by Purchaser, the parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Tender
Offer to close on the Closing Date and (iii) at the Closing, or such later
date specified in the Debt Tender Offer and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Corporation will accept
the K and F Subsidiary Notes tendered in the Debt Tender Offer. Subject to
_Section 5.1(c)_ , the Company shall, and shall cause K and F Subsidiary to,
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
the Debt Tender Offer.

  

### (c) Upon the request of Purchaser but subject to _Section 5.1(c)_, the
Company shall, and shall cause K and F Subsidiary to, prepare, as promptly as
practicable, the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement,
together with any required related letters of transmittal and similar
ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto and any consent solicitation documents referenced in
Section 5.6(a), being referred to herein collectively as the " _Debt Tender
Offer Documents_ "), relating to the Debt Tender Offer and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be disseminated to the
record holders of the K and F Subsidiary Notes, and to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge,
the beneficial owners of the K and F Subsidiary Notes, the Debt Tender
Offer Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the
dissemination thereof, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Purchaser
not less than ten (10) days in advance of any such dissemination (or such
shorter period of time as is reasonably practicable in light of when
Purchaser requests that K and F Subsidiary commence the Debt Tender Offer) and
shall consult with Purchaser with respect to the Debt Tender Offer Documents
and shall include in such Debt Tender Offer Documents all comments reasonably
proposed by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the Company.  If at any
time prior to the acceptance of the K and F Subsidiary Notes pursuant to the
Debt Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable Law
to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Debt Tender Offer
Documents, the Company shall, and shall cause K and F Subsidiary to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and disseminate such amendment or
supplement; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior

        

### to such dissemination, the Company shall provide copies thereof to
Purchaser not less than two (2) Business Days (or such shorter period of time
as is reasonably necessary in light of the circumstances) in advance of any
such dissemination and shall consult with Purchaser with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall include in such amendment or supplement all
comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees and representatives to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the " _TIA_ "), and any other applicable Law in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer.  Promptly following the expiration of the consent
solicitation, assuming the requisite consent from the holders of the K and F
Subsidiary Notes (including from persons holding proxies from such holders)
have been received, the Company shall, and shall cause K and F Subsidiary to,
cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_
") to become effective providing for the amendments of the Indenture
contemplated in the Debt Tender Offer Documents; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the fact that the Supplemental Indenture may become
effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth therein shall not become
operative unless and until all conditions to the Debt Tender Offer have been
satisfied or (subject to approval by Purchaser) waived by the Company in
accordance with the terms hereof. The form and substance of the Supplemental
Indenture shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company.

  

### (d) The Company shall, or shall cause K and F Subsidiary to, waive any of
the conditions to the Debt Tender Offer as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser (other than the condition that the Debt Tender Offer is conditioned
on the Closing as provided in clause (b) above), so long as such waivers
would not cause the Debt Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA or
any other applicable Law and shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, permit the K and F Subsidiary to, waive any condition to the Debt
Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer (including any extension thereof) other
than as agreed between Purchaser and the Company or as required in the
reasonable judgment of the Company to comply with applicable Law.

  

### (e) Regardless of whether the Closing occurs, Purchaser and Merger Sub,
jointly and severally, shall promptly, upon request by the Company (which may
require an advance of the amount of such costs, fees (including consent
solicitation fees) and expenses) reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs, fees (including consent solicitation fees)
and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
representatives in connection with this _Section 5.6_ , as such costs, fees
(including consent solicitation fees) and expenses are incurred. The Company
shall have no obligation to pay any such costs, fees and expenses requested
by the Company to be advanced by Purchaser unless and until Purchaser or
Merger Sub so advances such costs, fees and expenses.  Regardless of whether
the Closing occurs, Purchaser and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their
respective officers, directors, stockholders, Affiliates and representatives,
and

        

### each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning
of Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all costs, fees,
expenses and damages suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
any actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.6_.

  

### (f) The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.6_ if the Company shall have used its
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such obligation, regardless of
the actual outcome of any Debt Tender Offer or consent solicitation referred
to herein.

  

## _Section 5.7 StockholdersÂ’ Approval_. Except in the event of a Change of
Board Recommendation, (a) the Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company of this Agreement and
the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (b) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Requisite Stockholder Vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement required to consummate
the transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement and (c) the Board
of Directors shall publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within twenty-four (24) hours after any request of Purchaser or Merger Sub.
Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms
pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ , the Company shall submit this Agreement to its

withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation thereof or otherwise
effected a Change of Board Recommendation or proposed or announced any
intention to do so.

  

## _Section 5.8 Termination of Affiliate Transactions. _The Company and
Purchaser agree that, effective as of the Closing and without any further
action by the Company, Purchaser or any Principal Stockholder, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall release and be released from any and all rights,
privileges, obligations and liabilities under the agreements set forth on 
_Schedule 5.8_ (and all such agreements shall have no further force
or effect) pursuant to releases in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all
indemnification obligations arising under the agreements set forth on
_Schedule 5.8_ or in  _Section 5.12_ hereof shall not be so released and
shall survive according to their terms.

  

## _Section 5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. _The Company shall give
prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser or Merger Sub shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) to its Knowledge, any representation or
warranty made by it or any of the other parties hereto that is qualified as

or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

### (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than March 9, 2007,
Purchaser shall cause Parent to mail or post the Parent Shareholders Circular
to its shareholders calling for the EGM to be held as promptly as set forth
below, subject to applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the UKLA,
seeking Parent Shareholder Approval and commencing the Rights Issue. Subject
to _Section 5.10(d)_ , the Parent Shareholders Circular shall include the

extended, the date to which the EGM is so postponed, the " _Extended EGM
Date_ ") and use its commercially reasonable efforts to favorably resolve or

information relating to the Company, Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by

amendment or supplement to the Parent Shareholders Circular so that the
Parent Shareholders Circular shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

circumstances) in advance of any such dissemination and shall provide the
Company an opportunity to review and comment on such amendment or supplement
to the full extent practicable and shall include in such amendment or
supplement all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Purchaser.

  

### (b) Subject to _Section 5.10(d)_ , Purchaser shall cause Parent to use

### accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement in each case by
the Equity Financing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the
EGM is extended pursuant to _Section 5.10(a)_ , the Equity Financing Date
shall be extended by an equivalent number of days (provided if such day, as
extended, is not a Business Day then the next Business Day) as the EGM is
extended (as may be extended, the " _Outside Equity Financing Date_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of clause (iii), if a Designated
Termination Event has occurred, then the Purchaser shall conduct the
Financing Efforts. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
cause Parent, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make such funds
available to Merger Sub to permit Purchaser and Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.3_ and to make all other required payments (including without

Tender Offer is then required to be completed in accordance with the terms
thereof).

with respect to the Financing (including without limitation the progress of
the Rights Issue) and the EGM. If Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
have Knowledge of any fact or event which will or may prevent the conditions

Financing from being obtained timely as required herein, Purchaser shall
promptly disclose the same to the Company.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent

## _Section 5.12 Indemnification and Insurance_ _._

  

(a) Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (and
their successors) to establish and maintain for a period of not less than six
years from and after the Effective Time the respective provisions in their
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and other organizational documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of the current and former directors, officers,
employees and agents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") that are no less favorable to those persons than the
provisions of the Charter, Bylaws and other organizational documents of the

        

Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof, and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
adverse respect, except as required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall assume
and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants in this  _Section 5.12_.

  

### (b) In addition to and not in limitation of the terms of _Section

and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each a " _Company Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
including without limitation, liabilities arising out of or pertaining to
acts or omissions (other than illegal acts or fraud), by them in their
capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made to
any Company Indemnified Person to the extent it is finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction (after all rights to appeal shall
have expired) that such Company Indemnified Party did not, with the respect
to the matter subject to indemnification hereunder, act in good faith and in
a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company (or any Subsidiary thereof).  If any indemnity is
paid to or for the benefit of any Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 5.12(b)_ or otherwise, and it is later determined that such Company
Indemnified Party was not entitled to any part of such indemnification, such
Company Indemnified Party shall pay to Purchaser on demand such part of such
indemnification.

  

### (c) The Surviving Corporation shall purchase effective as of the
Effective Time and maintain, with insurance carriers believed to be
financially sound and reputable and without any lapse in coverage, tail

the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing
Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and (iii) shall contain
coverage that is at least as protective to the Persons covered by such
existing policies (a complete and accurate copy of which has been made
available to Purchaser) and shall in any event include non-management
directors Side A (DIC) coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 250% of such amount, the Company shall only
be required to obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required
to maintain) as much coverage as can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums
equal to 250% of such amount. The Surviving Corporation shall provide copies
of any such

        

### insurance policies to the insured parties thereunder and shall provide
all cooperation reasonably necessary in connection with the processing of any
eligible claim thereunder.

  

### (d) The Surviving Corporation and Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and
expenses, that may be incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.12_ as such
expenses and fees are incurred upon the written request of any Company
Indemnified Party subject to the provisions of the last sentence of _Section

is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person
(notwithstanding that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and
their respective successors, assigns, heirs and legal representatives.
The indemnification provided for herein shall be in addition to, and not
in limitation of, any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to the Charter or Bylaws or any other
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or by
Law, contract or otherwise.

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Company Indemnified Person or
Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.12_ shall continue in effect until
the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

  

### (g) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser or their properties and
assets, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.12_.

Subsidiaries.

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing

collective bargaining agreement (the " _Current_

comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits maintained for
and provided to Current Employees under the Company Compensation and Benefit
Plans (other than equity incentive plans) as a group immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation);
_provided_ , _however_ , subject to the foregoing, that nothing herein shall
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan as are necessary to conform with applicable Law or interfere with the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to make such changes as are necessary to
conform with applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from
any obligation to any Current Employee under an individual employment
agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this 
_Section 5.13_ shall limit the right of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current
Employee at any time.

  

### (c) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by Current Employees of the

account for vesting and eligibility purposes but not for accrual purposes,
except for vacation and severance, if applicable (without duplication of
benefits) under employee benefit plans of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries in which the Current Employees
participate, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under
the corresponding Company Compensation and Benefit Plans for those purposes.
Current Employees will not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitation under any health plan of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would
have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, Purchaser will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to give such Current Employees
credit under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles satisfied prior
to the Effective Time.

will provide an opportunity for Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub to make
reasonable revisions thereto.

  

### (e) This _Section 5.13_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 5.13_ , express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 5.13_ or to be treated as an amendment to any Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

  

## _Section 5.14 Takeover Laws. _The Company shall, upon the request of
Purchaser or Merger Sub, take all reasonable steps to exclude the
applicability of, or to assist in any challenge
