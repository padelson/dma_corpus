2002 (this "Agreement") by and among CORVIS CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation ("Corvis"), CORVIS ACQUISITION COMPANY, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Corvis ("Corvis Sub"), and
DORSAL NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   R E C I T
A L S  ---------------   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors (or authorized
committee thereof) of Corvis, Corvis Sub and the Company have each approved,
and declared it to be advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders, for Corvis to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of such
acquisition, the Boards of Directors (or authorized committee thereof) of
Corvis, Corvis Sub and the Company have each approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the merger (the "Merger") of Corvis Sub with and into the
Company, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") and subject to the conditions set forth herein, which
Merger will result in the Company becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Corvis;   WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement
to, Corvis and Corvis Sub to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the stockholders
identified on Schedule I hereto (except for George Stamas) (herein referred
to as the ---------- "Principal Stockholders") are entering into an
Indemnity Agreement and a Stockholders Agreement, each dated the date hereof
in the forms of Exhibit A and  --------- Exhibit B attached hereto
respectively, providing for certain actions relating --------- to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for federal income
tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Corvis, Corvis Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.2) and  ---------- subject to and upon the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Corvis Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Corvis Sub shall cease and the Company, as
the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall continue its existence under
the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Corvis. The
Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   1     1.2
Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or, 
-------------- to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in substantially the
form of Exhibit C attached hereto  --------- and executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or
such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger by
mutual agreement of Corvis and the Company, being the "Effective Time").  
1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger 
-------------------- shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all the assets, property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Corvis Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Corvis Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- At the
Effective Time and without further action on the part of the parties hereto,
(i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto
and  --------- (ii) the Bylaws of Corvis Sub shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5 Directors and
Officers. The directors and officers of Corvis Sub 
---------------------- immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws.   1.6 Conversion of Company Common Stock,
Preferred Stock, Etc. At the 
-------------------------------------------------------- Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the parties
hereto, the following shall occur:   (a) Subject to the provisions of this
Article I, all of the shares of Company\'s Common Stock, par value $.0001
(the "Company Common Stock"), Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$.0001 ("Series A Preferred Stock"), and Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $.0001 ("Series B Preferred Stock") (collectively, the
"Company Capital Stock") issued to those stockholders of the Company listed
on Schedule I (the "Company Preferred Stockholders") and 
---------- outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive in the aggregate forty
million (40,000,000) shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Corvis ("Corvis Common Stock"), subject
to the adjustment of that number as provided in Sections 1.10, 1.12 and
1.13(a) below. Those shares of Corvis Common Stock shall be allocated among
the Company Preferred Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(c) below.
The holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock (as defined in
Section 1.8 below) and unrestricted Company Common Stock identified on
Schedule II hereto shall  ----------- receive, in the aggregate Six Million
(6,000,000) Corvis Stock Options and shares of Corvis Common Stock, subject
to the adjustment of that number as provided in Sections 1.12 and 1.13(b)
below. The shares of Corvis Common Stock issued in exchange for Company
Restricted Stock shall be   2    subject to the terms of the Restricted
Stock Agreement in the form of Exhibit E  --------- hereto and as more fully
described in Section 1.8 hereof (the "Restricted Stock").   (b) The shares
of Corvis Common Stock issuable under this Agreement upon the Effective Time
are herein sometimes referred to as the "Merger Shares." As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be redeemed and canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such share of Company Capital
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Shares and any cash to
be paid in lieu of a fractional share of Corvis Common Stock upon surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.14(b) hereof (collectively,
the "Merger Consideration"), without interest.   (c) The parties
acknowledge that the Company will elect to adopt a plan of recapitalization
(the "Recapitalization"), pursuant to which, among other things, the
outstanding shares of Company\'s Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock (the "Company Preferred Stock") shall generally be
converted into the right to receive Forty Million (40,000,000) shares of
Corvis Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, subject to adjustment as
provided in this Agreement. The Recapitalization shall be effected by the
Company by filing an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation as
promptly as practicable following the approval thereof by the Company
Stockholders but in no event more than five (5) days prior to the date of the
meeting of Corvis stockholders called to approve the issuance of shares of
Corvis Common Stock to the stockholders of the Company in the Merger. The
Company shall notify Corvis in writing of the allocation of such shares of
Corvis Common Stock among the Company Preferred Stockholders pursuant to such
Recapitalization not later than as of the date the Recapitalization is
effected. The allocation required under the Recapitalization shall not be
made in such a manner as to cause adverse tax consequence to the holders of
Corvis Options or Corvis Restricted Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement.
In the event the Company fails or refuses to effect the Recapitalization and
provide the notice of the allocation of the applicable portion of Merger
Consideration among the Company Preferred Stockholders in accordance with the
foregoing requirements, Corvis shall have the right, as of the Closing Date,
if all other Conditions to Closing the Merger are met, to transfer any
unallocated Merger Shares into an escrow account with a reputable financial
services provider of its choosing for the benefit of all of the Company
Preferred Stockholders and the Company Preferred Stockholders
shall thereafter have the sole authority to direct the escrow agent as to
the allocation of those shares among them in a manner that preserves the tax-
free treatment of the Merger.   1.7 Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each
share of Company Capital Stock  ------------------------------- held in the
treasury of the Company and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by
Corvis, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof as of the Effective Time.  
1.8 Stock Options; Restricted Stock.  -------------------------------   (a)
At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Options") under the Company\'s 2000
Equity Compensation Plan (the "Company Option Plan"), by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the parties hereto or the
holders thereof, shall be exchanged for and replaced   3    with an
option (the "Corvis Option(s)") to purchase the number of shares of Corvis
Common Stock set forth opposite such holder\'s name on Schedule II hereof 
----------- and the exercise price per share of each such Corvis Option shall
be as set forth on Schedule II, subject to any adjustments for subsequent
events provided  ----------- for in the 2000 Corvis Long Term Incentive Plan
(the "Corvis Option Plan") under which those options are to be granted and
subject to adjustment in the number of such Corvis Options as provided in
Sections 1.12(a) and (b) and 1.13 below. Each Corvis Option granted pursuant
to this Section 1.8 and 1.13 shall be substantially similar in form to the
form of Corvis Option Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit F, and shall be
subject to all the terms and conditions of the  --------- Corvis Option
Plan.   (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock
(as defined in Section 1.8(f) below), by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be converted into the right
to receive that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Corvis
Common Stock set forth opposite the name of each holder of such Company
Restricted Stock on Schedule II hereto. -----------   (c) At the Effective
Time, each share of Company Common Stock which is not Company Restricted
Stock (exclusive of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, held by Company
Preferred Stockholders), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, shall be converted into the right to receive
that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Corvis Common Stock
set forth opposite the name of each holder of such unrestricted Company
Common Stock on Schedule II hereto.  -----------   (d) The vesting of
Company Options and Company Restricted Stock (as defined below) and any other
warrant or right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock shall not
accelerate as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (e) At the Effective Time, the Company Option Plan
shall be terminated and no further options or other rights to receive any
right to acquire the capital stock of the Company shall be granted under the
Company Option Plan following the date hereof, unless approved by Corvis
which approval shall be in its sole discretion.   (f) Shares of Corvis
Common Stock issued under Section 1.8(b) in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock which at the Effective Time are subject to transfer
restrictions, vesting requirements, and repurchase rights under the Company
Option Plan, including shares of Company Common Stock that were issued upon
the exercise of Company Options (the "Company Restricted Stock"), shall
be subject to the same transfer restrictions, repurchase rights, and vesting
as the Company Restricted Stock for which it is exchanged. Pursuant to
Section 11(a) of the Company Option Plan, the Company shall not take any
action or fail to take any action inconsistent with, and shall take such
action as is necessary or appropriate to cause each holder of such share of
Corvis Common Stock exchanged for Company Restricted Stock to become subject
to a Restricted Stock Agreement, substantially in the form attached here to
as Exhibit E.  ---------   (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, pursuant to Section 11(a) of the Company Option Plan, not take any
action inconsistent with or omit to take such actions, and shall take such
actions as is necessary or appropriate to cause the Company Options as of the
Effective Date to be evidenced by the form of Corvis Option attached hereto
as Exhibit F.  ---------   4     1.9 Capital Stock of Corvis Sub. Each
share of common stock, par value  --------------------------- $.0001 per
share, of Corvis Sub ("Corvis Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Corvis Sub evidencing
ownership of any Corvis Sub Common Stock shall from and after the Effective
Time evidence ownership of a like number of shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.10 Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The
number of shares of Corvis  ----------------------------------- Common Stock
or Corvis Options to be issued pursuant to Sections 1.6, 1.12 and 1.13 hereof
shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Corvis Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Corvis
Common Stock or Company Capital Stock, occurring after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.   1.11 Fractional Shares. No fraction of a
share of Corvis Common Stock  ----------------- shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Corvis Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Corvis Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall receive cash in an amount equal to the fair
value of such fractional interest. Any fraction of a share of Corvis Common
Stock issuable under any Corvis Option shall be rounded up to the next whole
share.   1.12 Adjustments for Reductions, Increases in Cash. 
---------------------------------------------   (a) If the amount of cash
and cash equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Time (A) less
each of the following: (i) the Company Transaction Expenses (as defined in
Section 8.4 below); (ii) the aggregate amount of trade payables and other
liabilities of the Company which were not paid in the Ordinary Course of
Business as required under Section 4.1 below) (the "Overdue Payables"); (iii)
the portion of the agreed value of the Transferred Equipment and In-Kind
Support furnished to the Company prior to the Effective Time that has not
been paid to Corvis (the "Equipment Debt"); and (iv) the amount owed as of
the Effective Time under the Comerica line of credit referenced in
Section 4.1(e) and under any other loan or borrowing made by the Company is
(B) less than the Required Cash Balance (as defined below) (the "Cash
Deficiency"), the number of shares of Corvis Common Stock, Corvis Restricted
Stock and Corvis Options issuable under Sections 1.6 and 1.8 shall be reduced
by a number of shares equal to the Cash Deficiency divided by $3.00.   (b)
If the amount of cash or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the
Effective Time is greater than the Required Cash Balance (the
"Cash Surplus"), the number of shares of Corvis Common Stock, Corvis
Restricted Stock and Corvis Options issuable under Sections 1.6 and 1.8 shall
be increased by a number of shares equal to (A) (i) the lesser of (I) the
Cash Surplus less the Company Transaction Expenses, the Overdue Payables, the
Equipment Debt, and the amount owed as of the Effective Time under the
Comerica line of credit referenced in Section 4.1(e) and under any other loan
or borrowing made by the Company or (II) the gross amount of proceeds
received by the Company from the sale of its Capital Stock from December 12,
2001 through the Effective Date (up to a maximum of $10.8 million) and from
the Comerica line of credit referenced in Section 4.1(e) below (less the
total amount owed under that Comerica   5    loan and any other loan or
borrowing made by the Company as of the Effective Date) less the Company
Transaction Expenses, the Overdue Payables, and the Equipment Debt (B)
divided by $3.00.   (c) Any reduction or increase in the number of shares of
Corvis Common Stock, Corvis Restricted Stock and Corvis Options under this
Section 1.12 shall be allocated as of the Effective Date as follows: 87% of
the aggregate reduction or increase in such shares shall be allocated to
reduce or increase, as applicable, the number of shares of Corvis Common
Stock issuable to the Company Preferred Stockholders in the proportions
provided in Section 1.6(c) above and 13% of the aggregate reduction or
increase in such shares shall be allocated to reduce or increase, as
applicable, the number of shares of Corvis Common Stock, Corvis Restricted
Stock or Corvis Options (excluding the Corvis Common Stock, if any, held by
the Company Preferred Stockholders) in the proportions provided in Section
1.13(b) below.   (d) The Required Cash Balance shall be determined based on
the applicable Closing Date as set forth in Schedule III hereto. If the
Closing Date is not on  ------------ the 15th or the last day of a calendar
month, the parties shall negotiate in good faith on an equitable adjustment
of the Required Cash Balance based on that Closing Date. The determination of
any Cash Deficiency or Cash Surplus shall be made in good faith by Corvis and
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. The amount of cash or
cash equivalents held by the Company on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be increased by the amount of expenses incurred and paid by the Company after
the date hereof and before the Effective Time at the specific written request
of Corvis.   1.13 Forfeiture of Stock Options Prior to Merger. 
-------------------------------------------   (a) If, at any time before the
Effective Time, the right to receive at the Effective Time any of Corvis
Options or Restricted Stock identified on Schedule II hereto are forfeited or
terminated as a result of the termination of ----------- employment of the
holder thereof prior to the Merger or otherwise expire (herein referred to as
the "Pre-Merger Terminated Options and Restricted Stock"), the Company
Preferred Stockholders shall receive in the aggregate, as additional Merger
Shares, a number of shares of Corvis Common Stock equal to 87% of
the aggregate of the Restricted Stock so terminated and 87% of the maximum
number of shares of Corvis Common Stock for which the Pre-Merger Terminated
Options would have been exercisable by the holder thereof immediately
following the Merger if they had not terminated, forfeited or expired
(assuming for that purpose only that the Pre-Merger Terminated Options were
fully vested) without effect for the exercise price of such terminated or
forfeited options. Those additional Merger Shares shall be allocated among
the Company Preferred Stockholders as provided in Section 1.6(c) above.  
(b) Each of the holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock
and unrestricted Company Common Stock (excluding the Company Preferred
Stockholders) as of the Effective Time shall receive, in the aggregate, a
number of additional Corvis Options and/or Corvis Common Stock (subject to
the restrictions under Section 1.8(e) above), as applicable, equal to 13% of
Pre-Merger Terminated Options and Restricted Stock multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable under Company Options and the shares of Company Restricted Stock and
unrestricted Company Common Stock held by such holder as of the Effective
Time and the denominator of which is the   6    aggregate number of all
shares of Company Common Stock issuable under all Company Options and all
shares of Company Restricted Stock and unrestricted Company Common Stock held
by all such holders as of the Effective Time (excluding for purposes of the
numerator and denominator the additional Corvis Options issuable under this
Section 1.13(b)). Such additional Corvis Options shall have the same exercise
price as the exercise price of such terminated Corvis Options. The number of
shares of Corvis Common Stock and/or Corvis Options to be distributed to a
holder pursuant to this Section 1.13(b) shall be allocated to such holder pro
rata as unrestricted Corvis Common Stock, Corvis Restricted Stock and/or
Corvis Options based on the proportion, if any, of unrestricted Common Stock,
Corvis Restricted Stock, and Corvis Options held by such holder immediately
prior to allocation.   1.14 Surrender of Certificates. 
-------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
Corvis shall designate a  -------------- bank or trust company (which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as Exchange Agent in the
Merger.   (b) Exchange Procedures. At the Effective Time, Corvis shall cause
to be  ------------------- delivered to the Exchange Agent certificates
representing the Merger Shares and cash sufficient to pay the consideration
in lieu of fractional shares. The Exchange Agent shall, promptly after the
Effective Time, deliver to each holder of record of Company Capital Stock
entitled to receive Merger Shares, a letter of transmittal and instructions
to surrender the certificates for such Company Capital Stock (each, a
"Company Certificate") in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Corvis Common Stock. Upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of

Assertion of Claims. No claim shall be brought under Sections 7.2 or

them, at any time prior to the applicable Survival Date, give the Principal
Stockholders\' Committee or Corvis (as appropriate) (a) written notice of the
existence of any such claim, specifying the nature and basis of such claim
and the amount thereof, to the extent known or (b) written notice pursuant to
Section 7.5 of any Third Party Claim, the existence of which might give rise
to such a claim. The failure to so provide such notice to the Stockholders
Committee or Corvis (as appropriate) will not relieve the Indemnifying
Persons from any liability which they may have to the Indemnified Persons
under this Agreement or otherwise (unless and only to the extent that such
failure results in any material loss or compromise of any rights or defenses
of the Indemnifying Persons and they were   40    not otherwise aware of
such action or claim). Upon the giving of such written notice as aforesaid,
the Indemnified Persons, or any of them, shall have the right to commence
legal proceedings prior or subsequent to the Survival Date for the
enforcement of their rights under Section 7.2 and 7.3 hereof.   7.5 Notice

Committee or Corvis (as appropriate) of any Third Party Claim that might give
rise to any Loss by the Indemnified Persons, stating the nature and basis of
such Third Party Claim, and the amount thereof to the extent known. Such
notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation
with respect to such Third Party Claim, including, without limitation, any
summons, complaint or other pleading that may have been served, any written
demand or any other document or instrument. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the failure to provide notice as aforesaid to the Stockholders\' Committee or
Corvis (as appropriate) will not relieve the Indemnifying Persons from any
liability which they may have to the Indemnified Persons under this Agreement
or otherwise (unless and only to the extent that such failure directly
results in the loss or compromise of any rights or defenses of the
Indemnifying Person and they were not otherwise aware of such action or
claim).   (b) The Indemnified Persons shall defend any Third Party Claims
with counsel of their own choosing, and shall act reasonably and in
accordance with their good faith business judgment in handling such Third
Party Claims. The Stockholders\' Committee or Corvis (as appropriate) and the
Indemnifying Persons, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Persons, on the
other hand, shall make available to each other and their counsel and
accountants all books and records and information relating to any Third Party
Claims, keep each other fully apprised as to the details and progress of all
proceedings relating thereto and render to each other such assistance as may
be reasonably required to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any and
all Third Party Claims. The Indemnifying Person(s) shall be entitled to
participate, with counsel of its/their own choosing, in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, at its/their own expense, provided that final decisions as
to the defense of such action shall be made by the Indemnified Person after
consultation with the Indemnifying Party(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Indemnified Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Person(s), effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the Indemnifying Person is an actual or potential party to
such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Person from all
liability arising out of such action or claim, and (ii) does not include
a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to
act, by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Person.   7.6 Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The representations and 
------------------------------------------ warranties made by the Company in
Article II and the Principal Stockholders in the Stockholders Agreement and
Corvis and Corvis Sub under Article III shall survive the Effective Time
until the later of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) 60
days after delivery of the audited financial statements of the Company for
fiscal year 2002 but in no event later than 60 days following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date.   41     7.7 Related Agreements.
Nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to  ------------------ limit,
terminate or restrict any of the rights and remedies Corvis or the Surviving
Corporation may have relating to or arising from any breach or default under
the Related Agreements.   7.8 Stockholders\' Committee. 
-----------------------   (a) Upon approval of the Merger, the Principal
Stockholders shall be deemed, for themselves and their personal
representatives and other successors, to have constituted and appointed,

Company, the giving and receiving of all notices and consents and the

or provision hereof or of the General Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and the
execution and delivery of any agreements and releases in connection with the
settlement of any dispute or claim under Article VII hereof or the General
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The vote of a majority of the Stockholders\'
Committee shall be required to take any action on behalf of the Principal
Stockholders pursuant to the authority granted to them under this Section
7.8.   (b) In the event of the death, incapacity, removal or resignation of
any of the members of any of the Stockholders\' Committee or a vacancy
thereon for any other reason, the remaining members of the Stockholders\'
Committee shall promptly appoint a further substitute or substitutes and
shall advise Corvis thereof. As between the Stockholders\' Committee and the
Principal Stockholders of the Company, the members of the Stockholders\'
Committee shall not be liable for, and shall be indemnified by the Principal
Stockholders or provided with insurance against, any good faith error of
judgment on their part or any other act done or omitted by them in good faith
in connection with their duties as members of such Committee, except for
gross negligence or willful misconduct.   ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION,

any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, including but
not limited to the covenant to secure the required employment agreements and

not been cured within 15 days after notice to the Company; or   (f) By the

reason other than pursuant to Section 8.1(e) above (the
"Applicable Termination"), Corvis agrees to make the following investments in
the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.3.  
43     (a) Within 30 days after the Applicable Termination, Corvis will,
upon the written request of the Company, transfer to the Company title to
equipment and other personal property to be identified by mutual agreement of
the parties (the "Transferred Equipment") and shall provide the in-kind
physical facilities support (the "In-Kind Support") to be mutually agreed
upon by the parties. The Transferred Equipment and In-Kind Support shall have
an aggregate fair market value of $8,000,000 and the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to reach agreement on that fair market value. In addition, with
the prior written consent of Corvis and the Company, Corvis may make
available Transferred Equipment or In-Kind Support prior to the Effective
Time for a purchase price to be negotiated by the parties. All such
Transferred Equipment shall be in good working condition, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and good title to such Transferred Equipment shall be conveyed
to the Company free and clear of any Liens. Except for the foregoing, Corvis
disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, of any kind or nature
relating to the Transferred Equipment, including warranties of fitness for a
particular purpose and warranties of merchantability. The parties will work
in good faith to substitute different items or equipment of comparable value
if necessary or appropriate as a result of the changing needs of the parties
or the unavailability of the stipulated equipment. The parties hereby agree
that the value of such Transferred Equipment and In-Kind Support is Eight
Million Dollars ($8,000,000). In consideration for the contribution of the
Transferred Equipment and In-Kind Support, the Company shall issue to Corvis,
as and when the Transferred Equipment and In-Kind Support are received,
shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at the same price, terms and
conditions as shares of Series B Preferred Stock are issued to
Optical Capital Group, L.P. ("OCG") with respect to OCG\'s investment of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(d)
below.   (b) Within 30 days after the Applicable Termination, upon the
written request by the Company, Corvis will purchase additional shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in cash. In
consideration for that Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) investment, the
Company shall issue to Corvis shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at the
same price, terms and conditions as shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
issued to OCG with respect to OCG\'s investment of Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) pursuant to Section 8.3(d) below.   (c) No later than 180 days
after the Applicable Termination, Corvis will, upon written request of the
Company, invest an additional Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (subject to
reduction as provided below) in the Company. In consideration for that
additional investment, the Company shall, at the option of Corvis, issue
shares of (i) the same series of Preferred Stock as the Company has sold to
any other investor (the "Additional Investor") at any period after the
Applicable Termination and such investment shall be on no less
favorable price, terms and conditions as that Additional Investor acquired
such shares, or (ii) Series B Preferred Stock at the price and terms provided
to OGG with respect to its investment under Section 8.3(d) below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the additional $5 million investment under
this Section 8.3(c) shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amounts in
excess of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) received or contractually
committed to the Company in a private placement of its securities after the
Applicable Termination (exclusive of the following amounts committed for
investment as of the date hereof: $4.6 million recent Series B escrow
takedown; $1.2 million purchase by U.S. Ventures of Series B Preferred Stock;
$7 million line of credit funding from Comerica and the existing OGG
commitment to invest an additional $5 million in the Company).   44    
(d) As a condition for Corvis making the investments referenced in 8.3(a),
(b) and (c) above, OCG shall purchase Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of
Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with its contractual commitment.  
(e) In the event that Corvis makes the contributions referenced in
this Section 8.3, following the Applicable Termination, the Company agrees
that for a period of three (3) years thereafter in response to any bids or
requests for proposal submitted to the Company by potential customers for the
purchase of both terrestrial and undersea optical networking equipment, the
Company will specify the use of Corvis as the provider of terrestrial
equipment provided that the bid or request for proposal permits the Company
to select or recommend the terrestrial equipment provider.   8.4 Fees,
Expenses and Additional Investment. Subject to Section 1.12 
---------------------------------------- above, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
