 **(a) ** Buyer will provide offers to employ as of the Closing Date each individual who is an employee (including, without limitation, employees who are on approved family or medical leave, short-term disability or other approved leaves of absence) of Seller with respect to the Hospital Businesses immediately prior to Closing in his or her current position (i.e. job duties, title, responsibilities and location), at his or her current salary or wages and at benefit levels such that his or her salary or wages and benefits are substantially the same, in the aggregate, as are the salary or wages and benefits applicable to such employee immediately prior to Closing.  Seller acknowledges that all employment offers will be made subject to the satisfactory completion by Buyer of its customary employee background checks and pre-employment screenings. Buyer will keep positions available for employees of Seller who are on approved family or medical leave, short-term disability or other approved leaves of absence on the Closing Date. Employees employed under written Contracts will not be offered employment pursuant to this Section, but shall be employed pursuant to the terms of the Assumed Contracts, if any, relating to such employees. Any workforce reduction after the Closing shall be conducted by Buyer in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Buyer will continue to maintain all Seller Employee Benefit Plans (except plans to which Code Section 403(b) applies) after the Closing until at least June 30, 2011 and, after such date, such Seller Employee Benefit Plans may be amended, modified, replaced or terminated in accordance with the provisions of such Seller Employee Benefit Plans, as amended, and applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, Buyer (i) will continue to maintain retiree life insurance benefits under Prudential Insurance Company of America Sinai Hospital of Detroit Insurance Continuance Fund Contract # 0041391 ("Sinai Plan") for retirees listed on Schedule 6.3(a) until all benefits have been paid in accordance with the terms of the Sinai Plan, (ii) agrees, for the period beginning on the Closing and ending June 30, 2011, to provide a rate of employer contributions under its 401(k) plan for Hired Employees which is equal to the rate of employer contributions in effect under the Seller's DMC 403(b) Matching Plan immediately prior to the Closing and, in Buyer's discretion, this rate of employer contributions may continue after such date, and (iii) agrees to provide Hired Employees who would have been credited with three years of vesting service under DMC's 403(b) Matching Plan had they continued employment with Seller continuously through June 30, 2011, a vesting schedule for matching contributions in Buyer's 401(k) plan equal to the vesting schedule for matching contributions under Seller's DMC 403(b) Matching Plan immediately prior to the Closing. Further, Buyer will allow the Hired Employees to participate in Buyer's 401(k) plan effective as of the Closing Date and will accept rollovers (including rollovers of any outstanding loans made as part of a direct rollover) by Hired Employees into Buyer's 401(k) plan from Seller's DMC 403(b) Matching Plan, to the extent any such rollover qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code.

  

 **(b) ** Nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of Buyer to terminate at will the employment of any Hired Employee (except as otherwise provided in Assumed Contracts with such employees), or limit the right of Buyer to apply its existing personnel policies and procedures to the Hired Employees. Nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of Buyer to make changes after Closing to the terms and conditions of Seller Employee Benefit Plans offered to the Hired Employees and assumed under this Agreement, or to terminate such plans (subject to the requirement in Section 6.3(a) that Buyer maintain all Seller Employee Benefit Plans after the Closing until at least June 30, 2011), provided such changes are effected in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such Seller Employee Benefit Plans.

  

 **(c) ** Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall recognize each union that is a party to an unexpired collective bargaining agreement with any Seller as the sole and exclusive representative of the bargaining units covered by such collective bargaining agreement. In addition, upon the Closing, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall be bound by the terms of each such collective bargaining agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to impose any such collective bargaining agreement on any employees not includable as a matter of law in the bargaining unit described in each such collective bargaining agreement.

  

 **(d) ** With respect to the Hired Employees and their eligible dependents, Buyer will count service with Seller as service with Buyer for purposes of satisfying any eligibility waiting periods and the "pre-existing condition" exclusions under any applicable Employee Welfare Benefit Plan offered to the Hired Employees. Buyer shall give all Hired Employees credit for their accumulated and unused vacation, sick and personal days, to the extent the same constitute Accrued CTO, and for their Unbooked Employee Benefits; such amounts shall not be subject to reduction, offset or any other limitation under Buyer's vacation, holiday, sick pay or paid time-off policies and procedures. Buyer shall give all Hired Employees credit after Closing for their years of service with Seller for the purposes of determining how much vacation, holiday and sick pay, severance pay and other benefits the Hired Employees are entitled to under the applicable Employee Welfare Benefit Plan offered to the Hired Employees and for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under any Employee Pension Benefit Plans offered to the Hired Employees. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer will assume sponsorship of and maintain in all respects to the extent required under Section 6.3(a) (including making any required contributions) all Seller Employee Benefit Plans (except plans to which Code Section 403(b) applies).

  

 **(e) ** Buyer shall be treated as a "successor employer" to Seller for purposes of providing coverage under COBRA with respect to any "qualified beneficiary" under a Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan," and as such, Buyer shall assume the obligation (and all liability associated with such obligation) to provide coverage under COBRA to such "qualified beneficiaries." For the purposes hereof, "qualified beneficiary," "group health plan," and "successor employer" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

 **(f) ** Buyer will credit each Hired Employee and their eligible dependents under the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans offered to the Hired Employee with any deductibles, co-payments or other cost-sharing amounts incurred by the Hired Employee or eligible dependent under Seller's Employee Welfare Benefit Plans for the current plan year and before the Closing Date.

  

 **(g) ** Buyer will provide tuition reimbursement to the Hired Employees enrolled in a qualified educational program at Closing, for the year in which the Closing occurs, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Seller's tuition reimbursement plan.

  

 **(h) ** The parties intend to comply with the requirements of § 4204 of ERISA in order that the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall not be deemed a complete and partial withdrawal liability from any Multiemployer Plan. Accordingly, Seller and Buyer agree:

  

 **(i)** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall contribute to each Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations of Seller for substantially the same number of "contribution base units" for which Seller had an "obligation to contribute" to each Multiemployer Plan pursuant to each collective bargaining agreement.

  

 **(ii)** To the extent required by §4204 of ERISA, unless exempted under PBGC Regulation Sections 4204.11, 4204.12 or 4204.13, Buyer shall provide to each Multiemployer Plan, for a period of five consecutive plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the Closing Date, either a bond issued by a surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of § 412 of ERISA or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to each Multiemployer Plan. The amount of such bond or escrow deposit to each Multiemployer Plan shall be equal to the greater of (A) the average annual contribution that Seller was required to make under such Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations of the Hospital Businesses for the three plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, or (B) the annual contribution that Seller was required to make under such Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations of the Seller for the last plan year immediately preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  

 **(iii)** If Buyer completely or partially withdraws from any Multiemployer Plan prior to the end of the fifth plan year beginning after the Closing Date, and the resulting liability of Buyer with respect to the Multiemployer Plan is not paid, then it is acknowledged and agreed that Seller shall be secondarily liable in an amount not to exceed the amount of withdrawal liability Seller would have had to pay to such Multiemployer Plan as a result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement but for §4204 of ERISA. Buyer shall indemnify Seller against any liability incurred by Seller pursuant to this clause (iii).

  

 **(iv) ** Seller shall cooperate with Buyer if Buyer wishes to prepare and submit to any Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC a request for a variance of exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of §4204(a)(i)(B) of ERISA (as described in Section6.3(h)). Unless and until such a variance or exemption is granted, Buyer shall comply with the bond/escrow requirement except to the extent provided in PBGC Regulation Section 4204.11(d).

  

 **(i) ** If any Reportable Event occurs with respect to any Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan and such Reportable Event requires notice to be given on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall comply with such notice requirements.

 **10.7 _Effect of Termination_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.5(a), other than pursuant to Sections 10.5(a)(iii), 10.5(a)(iv) or 10.5(a)(v) (but only to the extent provided in Section 10.7(b)), no Party shall have any claim against the other, whether under the terms of this Agreement or under applicable Laws; provided, however, if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(ix), Buyer's only obligation to Seller hereunder shall be to pay to Seller in cash a termination fee of $50,000,000. If the circumstances that require Seller or Buyer to pay liquidated damages to the other as a consequence of a termination of the Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.5(a)(iii), 10.5(a)(iv) or 10.5(a)(v) as provided in Section 10.7(b) or (c) are not met, then no Party shall have any claim against the other, whether under the terms of this Agreement or under applicable Laws.

  

 **(b) ** Buyer understands and acknowledges that in the event that Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(iii) or Section 10.5(a)(v), in either case as a result of an intentional breach by Buyer (but in the case of Section 10.5(a)(iii) only to the extent such breach was both intentional and results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate (i) Losses of $25,000,000 or more or (ii) an adverse effect on EBITDA of Vanguard and its consolidated subsidiaries in excess of $10,000,000 on an annualized basis), Seller will have incurred substantial monetary damages that are not readily subject to determination. Therefore, in order to avoid uncertainty and to clearly establish the damages that Seller would sustain in the event that Seller terminates this Agreement for the reasons described in this Section10.7(b), Buyer shall pay to Seller as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the amount of $50,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement arising from Buyer's failure to satisfy its obligations on the Closing Date after all conditions precedent to Buyer's obligations contained herein have been satisfied shall entitle Seller to recovery of $50,000,000 liquidated damages pursuant to this Section 10.7(b).

  

 **(c) ** Seller understands and acknowledges that in the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(iii) or Section 10.5(a)(iv), in either case as a result of an intentional breach by Seller (but in the case of Section 10.5(a)(iii) only to the extent such breach was both intentional and results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate (i) Losses of $25,000,000 or more or (ii) an adverse effect on EBITDA of the Hospital Businesses in excess of $10,000,000 on an annualized basis), Buyer will have incurred substantial monetary damages that are not readily subject to determination.  Therefore, in order to avoid uncertainty and to clearly establish the damages that Buyer would sustain in the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement for the reasons described in this 10.7(c), Seller shall pay to Buyer as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the amount of $50,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement arising from Seller's failure to satisfy its obligations on the Closing Date after all conditions precedent to Seller's obligations contained herein have been satisfied shall entitle Buyer to recovery of $50,000,000 liquidated damages pursuant to this Section 10.7(c).

  

 **(d) ** In the event Buyer is obligated to pay to Seller the $50,000,000 termination fee described above or the $50,000,000 in liquidated damages as described above, in no event shall Seller and its Affiliates be entitled to receive any damages in excess of $50,000,000, in the aggregate, inclusive of such termination fee or such liquidated damages provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for all losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Vanguard, or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 **(e) ** In the event Seller is obligated to pay to Buyer the $50,000,000 in liquidated damages as described above, in no event shall Buyer and Vanguard be entitled to receive any damages in excess of $50,000,000, in the aggregate, inclusive of such liquidated damages provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for all losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Seller, or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 **(f) ** Upon termination of this Agreement, Buyer's right of access shall terminate, each Party shall promptly return every document furnished it by the other Party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after execution of this Agreement, and all copies thereof, and will destroy all copies of any analyses, studies, compilations or other documents prepared by it or its representatives to the extent they contain any information with respect to the business of the other Parties or their Affiliates, and will cause its representatives to whom such documents were furnished to comply with the foregoing.

  

 **(g) ** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 10.7 are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement. This Section 10.7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 **(b) ** Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Seller, or any successor to Seller, shall be permitted at any time and from time to time to engage in the health care businesses described on _Schedule 11.2_, or to make grants to fund any health care related activities or businesses described on _Schedule 11.2_; (ii) Seller may exercise the Warrants and hold an equity interest in Vanguard, which the Parties acknowledge is not an Affiliate of Seller subject to the limitations of this Section; and (iii) Seller may advertise generally for employment opportunities and issue other notices of employment opportunities to the public at large and employ Hired Employees who accept offers of employment pursuant to such general advertisements and public notices.

  

 **(c) ** Seller acknowledges that any remedy at law for any breach of this Section would be inadequate and consents to the granting by any court of an injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order that a breach or threatened breach of this Section may be effectively enjoined.

  

 **11.3 _Change of Corporate Names_** ** __**. Promptly after Closing, Seller shall change its corporate or other legal entity names to names not including "DMC," "The Detroit Medical Center," the commonly known names of any of the Hospitals or any of the Hospital Businesses, or any variation of the foregoing related to or suggesting activities falling within the sphere of activities restricted under Section 11.2; provided that DMC may change its name to "The Detroit Medical Center Foundation," "DMC Foundation" or another name substantially similar thereto.

 **11.4 _Further Assurances_** ** __**. At any time and from time to time at and after the Closing, upon request of Buyer, Seller shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of attorney, confirmations and assurances as Buyer may reasonably request to more effectively convey, assign and transfer to and vest in Buyer full legal right, title and interest in and actual possession of the Assets and the Hospital Businesses, and to generally carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 **ARTICLE 12** 
  **POST-CLOSING COVENANTS OF BUYER**

  

 **12.1 _Buyer Advisory Board; Hospital Advisory Board_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** As of Closing, VHS of Michigan shall establish an Advisory Board (the "VHS Michigan Advisory Board") which shall be comprised of up to 11 members, a majority of whom shall be appointed by VHS of Michigan and the remainder of whom shall be appointed by DMC. Subject to the overall control and direction of the board of directors of VHS of Michigan, the VHS Michigan Advisory Board will oversee the conduct of the business of the Hospitals and the Hospital Businesses after Closing, will nominate members for each of the Hospital Advisory Boards, and will report to, and generally provide advice and make recommendations to, VHS of Michigan concerning the conduct of the business of the Hospitals, the Hospital Businesses, and the operating and capital budgets thereof. DMC may remove, with or without cause, any individual appointed by DMC to the VHS Michigan Advisory Board. VHS of Michigan may remove, with or without cause, any individual appointed by VHS of Michigan to the VHS Michigan Advisory Board. If, as a result of death, disability, retirement, resignation, removal or otherwise, there shall exist any vacancy on the VHS Michigan Advisory Board, the Person entitled under this Section 12.(a) to appoint such individual whose death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal resulted in such vacancy may appoint another individual to fill such capacity and serve as a member of the VHS Michigan Advisory Board. As of Closing, the VHS Michigan Advisory Board shall adopt bylaws that more precisely articulate the relationship between VHS of Michigan and the VHS Michigan Advisory Board and that govern its internal structure, activities and meetings (including the frequency thereof) that are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to DMC and VHS of Michigan. The VHS Michigan Advisory Board will remain in existence for a period of at least ten years.

  

 **(b) ** Immediately after the Closing, the members of the current executive management team of Seller (comprising for this purpose the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Nursing Officer, the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Medical Officer of DMC and the President of each of the Hospitals), who accept Buyer's offer of employment pursuant to Section 6.3(a), will be employed to manage the Hospitals and the Hospital Businesses in such respective capacities, subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreement and the authority of the applicable Buyer's board of directors.

  

 **(c) ** As soon as practicable following Closing, VHS of Michigan, acting in concert with or through the VHS Michigan Advisory Board, will appoint and maintain separate advisory boards for each of the Hospitals (each, a "Hospital Advisory Board"). Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each Hospital Advisory Board will advise the Hospital with which it is associated on quality assurance and accreditation matters. In its advisory capacity, each Hospital Advisory Board shall also review and advise Buyer on management's recommended capital and operational budgets for the Hospital with which it is associated. The membership of each initial Hospital Advisory Board shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

 **12.2 _Indigent and Low Income Care_** ** __**. Buyer acknowledges that the Hospitals have historically provided significant levels of care for indigent and low-income patients and have also provided care through a variety of community-based health programs. Buyer will maintain and adhere to (a) Seller's historic policy on charity care, a copy of which is attached as _Schedule 12.2_, or (b) at Buyer's discretion, the charity care policy utilized by any Affiliate of Buyer from time-to-time so long as such policy is no less favorable to indigent and low-income patients in any respect than the policy attached as _Schedule12.2_ , and provide charity care according to such policy (described in Section 12.2(a) or 12.2(b)) for at least ten years from and after Closing. Upon request of Seller at any time during the 180 day period prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date to determine whether Buyer should extend its commitment to adhere to Seller's charity care policy and provide charity care at the Hospitals according to the historic policy of Seller, it being understood that such negotiations shall be limited in scope to the extension of Seller's charity care policy at the Hospitals after the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

 **12.3 _Commitments to Maintain the Hospitals and Provide Core Services_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** For at least ten years from and after the Closing Date and unless otherwise agreed by Seller, Buyer shall maintain each of the Hospitals as a general acute care hospital licensed in the State of Michigan, or as a rehabilitation hospital licensed in the State of Michigan in the case of Rehabilitation Hospital of Michigan. The Parties acknowledge that the Hospitals provide a large share of the State of Michigan's graduate medical education and care to beneficiaries of the Medicaid program and to the uninsured. Reductions in state or federal funding and reimbursement that apply proportionately to the Hospitals and all other general acute care hospitals in the State of Michigan shall not constitute a basis for Buyer to request approval from Seller to close any Hospital. The Parties also acknowledge that this provision is not intended to preclude Buyer from requesting approval from Seller to close a Hospital in the event of discriminatory reductions in state or federal funding and reimbursement for graduate medical education or services provided to beneficiaries of the Medicaid program or to the uninsured. Reductions in state or federal funding and reimbursement to the Hospitals that are materially disproportionate to reductions in funding and reimbursement to all other general acute care hospitals in the State of Michigan and that cause one or more of the Hospitals to suffer material declines in EBITDA, shall constitute a basis for Buyer to request the approval of Seller to close such affected Hospitals, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon such time as Buyer, if at all, is permitted to cease maintaining the operation of any Hospital prior to the date which is ten years from and after the Closing Date, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, once Buyer has initiated the process of ceasing the operation of such Hospital, Buyer shall be relieved of its obligations under each of Sections12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.7, but in each case only with respect to such Hospital.

  

 **(b) ** For at least ten years from and after the Closing Date and unless otherwise agreed by Seller, Buyer shall provide at each Hospital, at a minimum, those services described on _Schedule 12.3_ for such Hospital (the "Core Services"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a consequence of any facts or circumstances that are in existence or occur prior to Closing, Buyer is not able to provide a Core Service after Closing, Buyer shall be relieved of its obligation to provide such Core Service until such time as the facts or circumstances that prevent Buyer from providing such Core Services have been remedied by Buyer. Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remedy any such facts and circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable after Closing (but only to the extent such remedy is economically feasible, as determined in the good faith reasonable discretion of Buyer).  Additionally, if a casualty has occurred prior to Closing which has not been fully repaired as of the Closing Date that prevents Seller from providing a Core Service, Buyer shall not be obligated to provide such Core Service until such time as Buyer has repaired the casualty (but only to the extent such repair is economically feasible, as determined in the good faith reasonable discretion of Buyer) that prevents Buyer from providing such Core Service after Closing. Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to repair any such casualty as soon as reasonably practicable after Closing (but only to the extent such repair is economically feasible, as determined in the good faith reasonable opinion of Seller).

  

 **12.4 _Capital Expenditures_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** During the five year period immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer shall make routine capital expenditures in respect of the Hospital Businesses in an average amount of at least $70,000,000 per year, but not less than $50,000,000 in the first year after Closing, and not less than $50,000,000 on average per year for each of the next four years thereafter taking into consideration all routine capital expenditures made by Buyer in all prior years since Closing, and in the amount of at least $350,000,000 in the aggregate over that period. For purposes of this Section 12.4(a), routine capital expenditures shall include (i) capital expenditures for any capital project that is not a Specified Capital Project, (ii) capital expenditures made pursuant to Section 12.4(b) in excess of the CapEx Commitment (but only to the extent that all Specified Capital Projects have been completed), and (iii) capital expenditures described in Section 12.4(f), but shall exclude (iv) capital expenditures for Specified Capital Projects and (v) capital expenditures for capital projects that are in progress as of the Closing Date and that are identified on  _Schedule 12.4_. Additionally and for purposes of this Agreement, the term "capital expenditure" shall mean an expenditure which is required to be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures as applied in the United States.

  

 **(b) ** In addition to Buyer's obligations under Section12.4(a), (i) during the five year period immediately following the Closing Date Buyer will Expend funds for the Specified Capital Projects in the aggregate amount of at least $500,000,000 (the "CapEx Commitment"), and (ii) as of each anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will have Expended not less than the Anniversary Date CapEx Commitment required to be so Expended by such date. _Schedule 12.4_ sets forth (1) Seller's current estimated cost of each Specified Capital Project described therein, (2) the anticipated time schedule for the commencement and completion of each Specified Capital Project, and (3) the estimated amount of capital to be Expended by Buyer on each Specified Capital Project. Buyer will in good faith undertake and diligently pursue to completion each of the Specified Capital Projects within the time schedule for such project specified on _Schedule 12.4_. Buyer may make modifications to a Specified Capital Project that constitute more than a ten percent reduction in the scope of, or a $5,000,000 reduction in, such Specified Capital Project, in each case, only with the consent of DMC, other than modifications that expand the scope of a Specified Capital Project; provided, however, DMC's approval of any requested modification to a Specified Capital Project shall not result in a reduction of Buyer's overall $500,000,000 CapEx Commitment. In the event that Buyer requests reduction in the scope of a Specified Capital Project by more than ten percent in order for such project to be completed on the budget for such project set forth on  _Schedule 12.4_ , Buyer and DMC shall reasonably and in good faith determine the manner in which such project is to be completed. Buyer shall have no obligation to Expend more than $500,000,000 in the aggregate for all of the Specified Capital Projects. The amount of any capital expenditures made by Buyer to an Affiliate of Buyer shall not be included in any determinations of whether Buyer has satisfied its obligations under Sections 12.4(a) or 12.4(b).

  

 **(c) ** Subject to Force Majeure, if at the end of any CapEx Year after Closing other than the fifth CapEx Year Buyer has failed to Expend the Anniversary Date CapEx Commitment required to have been Expended at the end of such CapEx Year, then within 30 Business Days after the expiration of such CapEx Year, Buyer will deliver to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the CapEx Shortfall as of the end of such CapEx Year. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement that is in form and substance satisfactory to each of Seller and Buyer in its good faith reasonable discretion (the "CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement"), the Escrow Agent shall thereafter disburse such funds solely for the purpose of funding capital Expended by Buyer in respect of the Specified Capital Projects. 

  

 **(d) ** Within 30 Business Days after the expiration of the fifth CapEx Year after Closing, subject to Force Majeure, Buyer will deliver to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount, if any, equal to (i) the CapEx Commitment _minus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of capital Expended by Buyer pursuant to Section 12.4(b) during the five CapEx Years after Closing (including amounts disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement to fund capital expenditures for Specified Capital Projects), _minus_ (ii) any funds held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement (or otherwise held in an escrow account with an escrow agent and pursuant to an escrow agreement, each of which is reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, which escrow has been restricted for use only for the CapEx Commitment) as of the end of the fifth CapEx Year. Subject to Section12.4(e), the Escrow Agent shall thereafter disburse such funds solely for the purpose of funding capital Expended by Buyer for the Specified Capital Projects, so long as Buyer is diligently pursuing in good faith the construction and completion of any Specified Capital Projects which had not yet been completed as of the end of the fifth CapEx Year after Closing.

  

 **(e) ** On the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to Force Majeure, the Escrow Agent shall continue to retain all funds held by the Escrow Agent up to (but not in excess of) $50,000,000 and shall disburse such funds solely for the purpose of funding capital Expended by Buyer for the Children's Hospital tower project, so long as Buyer is diligently pursuing in good faith the construction and completion of the Specified Capital Project constituting the Children's Hospital tower, and, subject to Section 12.4(f), shall immediately disburse all funds held by the Escrow Agent in excess of $50,000,000 to the order of DMC. On the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to Section 12.4(f), the Escrow Agent shall immediately disburse all remaining funds held by the Escrow Agent to the order of DMC. Additionally and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Buyer ceases to diligently pursue in good faith the construction and completion of any Specified Capital Project after the expiration of the fifth CapEx Year, the Escrow Agent shall disburse all funds held for such Specified Capital Project pursuant to the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement, together with any earnings thereon, to the order of DMC. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon DMC's receipt of all remaining funds held by Escrow Agent, Buyer shall have no further obligations under Sections 12.4(b) through 12.4(f) (other than any of such obligations that are in dispute on such date) and, to the extent it remains outstanding, the Warrant Certificate shall be immediately returned to Vanguard and immediately cancelled.

  

 **(f) ** If, prior to the date the Escrow Agent is required to disburse any funds to the order of DMC pursuant to Section12.4(e), Buyer completes all of the Specified Capital Projects but has not fully Expended the CapEx Commitment, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.4(e), Escrow Agent shall retain all funds held by the Escrow Agent and shall disburse such funds solely for the purpose of funding capital Expended by Buyer for additional capital projects or capital expenditures recommended by Buyer and approved by Seller in its good faith reasonable discretion, until all such funds are fully Expended.

  

 **(g) ** The CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Escrow Agent shall invest all funds held pursuant to the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement in investments described in the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement pursuant to the instructions of Buyer. All earnings on funds held by the Escrow Agent shall be disbursed to the Party to whom such funds are disbursed. Buyer shall pay all costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 **(h) ** At Closing and as collateral to secure Buyer's CapEx Commitment described in Section 12.4(b), Vanguard will deliver to the Escrow Agent (without any consideration from DMC) a warrant certificate in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ (the "Warrant Certificate") providing for warrants issuable to DMC to purchase shares of common stock of Vanguard having an aggregate value (as determined by the Independent Appraiser) as of the date of the most recent valuation prepared by the Independent Appraiser of $500,000,000. The Independent Appraiser shall opine on the value of Vanguard's common stock as of a date not earlier than June 30, 2010 based upon the amount upon which Vanguard's common stock could be bought or sold in a transaction between willing parties, each having full knowledge of all material facts and circumstances, and absent a forced liquidation or sale, taking into consideration, without limitation, the following: Vanguard's history; general, industry-specific and Vanguard-specific economic outlooks; historical trends of Vanguard's earnings, expenses and financial condition; Vanguard's earnings and dividend paying capacity; Vanguard's discounted cash flows; pro-forma adjustments; the number of Vanguard's outstanding common shares, options and warrants; the risks associated with Vanguard's earnings, capital structure, competition and similar factors; and market values, trading multiples and comparable earnings information of Vanguard's peer companies and publicly-traded hospital companies. ** ** The Independent Appraiser shall prepare such valuation in a manner that is consistent with, and uses the same methodologies and procedures used by the Independent Appraiser in, the most recent valuation of Vanguard's common stock prepared by the Independent Appraiser. Vanguard shall deliver to DMC a copy of the June 30, 2010 valuation within ten Business Days after its delivery to Vanguard and will thereafter, until such time as the Warrants have been exercised or the Warrant Certificate has been cancelled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, deliver to DMC all other valuations of Vanguard prepared by the Independent Appraiser within ten Business Days after their delivery to Vanguard. The Escrow Agent shall hold and disburse the Warrant Certificate pursuant to the terms of Section 12.5 and an escrow agreement that is in form and substance satisfactory to each of DMC and Vanguard in its good faith reasonable discretion (the "Warrant Escrow Agreement").

  

 **(i) ** In the event of discriminatory reductions in state or federal funding and reimbursement for graduate medical education or services provided to beneficiaries of the Medicaid program or to the uninsured that are applicable to the Hospitals, that are materially disproportionate to reductions in such funding and reimbursement to all other general acute care hospitals in the State of Michigan and that cause one or more of the Hospitals to suffer material declines in EBITDA, and Buyer provides Seller written notice thereof, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Section 12.4 or in Sections 1.1 or 12.5, without further action of the Parties: (i) the Anniversary Date CapEx Commitment shall be modified so that such commitment is (A) $400,000,000 as of the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (B) $480,000,000 as of the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date and (C) $500,000,000 as of the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, but without any change or modification to the obligation of Buyer to Expend funds in accordance with Sections 12.4(b) and (c) in the first four CapEx Years after Closing; (ii) the "five year period" described in Section 12.4(b) shall thereafter be interpreted to mean the period ending upon the expiration of the seventh CapEx Year; (iii) references in each of Sections 12.4(c), 12.4(d) and 12.5 to the "fifth CapEx Year" where it appears therein shall be references to the "seventh CapEx Year;" (iv) the reference to the "five CapEx Years after Closing" in Section 12.4(d) where it appears therein shall be references to the "seven CapEx Years after Closing;" (v) Section 12.4(e) shall no longer be applicable (other than the last sentence thereof); (vi) on December 31, 2017, the Escrow Agent shall disburse all funds held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the CapEx Shortfall Escrow Agreement, together with all earnings thereon, to the order of DMC; and (vii) the anticipated time schedule for undertaking each Specified Capital Project shall be deemed to be extended to take into consideration the additional period of time within which Buyer has to Expend the full amount of the CapEx Commitment.

  

 **12.5 _The Warrants_** ** __**. 

  

 **(a) ** At Closing, Vanguard shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an initial Warrant Certificate for the Warrants. Within 30 Business Days after the expiration of each CapEx Year after the Closing Date, up to and including the date which is 30 Business Days after the expiration of the fifth CapEx Year after the Closing, Vanguard may deliver to the Escrow Agent a new Warrant Certificate (in exchange for the return of any Warrant Certificate previously delivered to the Escrow Agent) for warrants issued to DMC to purchase a number of shares of common stock of Vanguard equal to the product of the Warrant Shares and the Remaining CapEx Ratio as of the expiration of the applicable CapEx Year after the Closing (the "Adjusted Warrant Shares") with an exercise price of $.01 per share. At such time as the amount of the Adjusted Warrant Shares equals zero, Vanguard shall provide notice thereof to Escrow Agent and Escrow Agent shall immediately return to Vanguard any Warrant Certificate previously delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon DMC's receipt of the Warrant Certificate, Buyer shall be relieved of its obligations under Sections 12,4(b) through 12.4(f) to the extent of the then value of the shares of common stock then purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant (it being understood that such determination shall be made as of the date of DMC's receipt of the Warrant Certificate, and shall not be subject to further adjustment, including as a result of any subsequent change in the valuation of Vanguard's common stock), based on the valuation of Vanguard's common stock prepared by the Independent Appraiser as of the date of the exercise of the Warrant, which appraisal shall be obtained by Vanguard, at its sole cost and expense, within a reasonable period of time after the date the Warrant is exercised. If such value of the shares of common stock upon exercise of the Warrant is greater than the Remaining CapEx Commitment, DMC shall surrender to Vanguard, after exercise, a number of shares of common stock of Vanguard having an aggregate value equal to the value of the common stock in excess of the Remaining CapEx Commitment (it being understood that such determination shall be made as of the date of DMC's receipt of the Warrant Certificate, and shall not be subject to further adjustment, including as a result of any subsequent change in the valuation of Vanguard's common stock).

  

 **(b) ** If Buyer shall fail at any time to timely deposit any required CapEx Shortfall amounts with the Escrow Agent (provided that Buyer has not otherwise deposited cash amounts in an escrow account with an escrow agent and pursuant to an escrow agreement, each of which is reasonably satisfactory to DMC, Buyer and Vanguard, which escrow account has been restricted for use only for the CapEx Commitment, which cash amounts equal or exceed the amounts which were required to have been so deposited to satisfy any CapEx Shortfall), then, after 30 days notice of such default to Vanguard by Seller, and subject to Vanguard's failure to cure such default during such 30-day period (each a "CapEx Shortfall Default"), DMC shall be entitled to obtain from the Escrow Agent the Warrant Certificate then in the possession of the Escrow Agent and the Warrant Shares or Adjusted Warrant Shares, as applicable, shall be immediately exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Certificate upon DMC's receipt of such Warrant Certificate.

  

 **(c) ** Provided that Buyer has deposited any required CapEx Shortfall with the Escrow Agent (or Buyer has otherwise deposited cash amounts in an escrow account with an escrow agent and pursuant to an escrow agreement, each of which is reasonably satisfactory to DMC, Buyer and Vanguard, which escrow has been restricted for use only for the CapEx Commitment, which cash amounts equal or exceed the amounts which were required to have been so deposited to satisfy any CapEx Shortfall), if Vanguard should wish to consummate an initial public offering of its common stock at any time while the Warrant Certificate remains outstanding (whether the Warrant Certificate is then held by Escrow Agent or DMC), in order to provide for the cancellation of the Warrant Certificate to facilitate such initial public offering, then at any time after Vanguard files its S‑1 Registration Statement with the SEC, but prior to its initial public offering of its common stock: (i) Vanguard may, but is not required to, deliver to the Escrow Agent or DMC (in exchange for the Warrant Certificate then in the possession of the Escrow Agent or DMC, which Warrant Certificate shall be immediately cancelled) a subordinated unsecured promissory note in substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ payable to DMC in a principal amount equal to the Remaining CapEx Commitment at such time (the "Note"), and the principal amount of such Note shall be automatically reduced on a continuous basis by the amount of any reduction in the Remaining CapEx Commitment; or (ii) DMC and Vanguard shall enter into such other satisfactory arrangements in respect of cancellation of the Warrant Certificate as shall be agreed to by DMC and Vanguard, in their sole discretion.

  

 **(d) ** In the event Vanguard delivers the Note in exchange for the Warrant Certificate as set forth in Section 12.5(c), the Escrow Agent shall release the Note to DMC upon the occurrence of a CapEx Shortfall Default; provided that upon a CapEx Shortfall Default, the Note shall be in default upon delivery thereof to DMC (the "Note Delivery Date"). The Note will accrue interest from and after the date of the CapEx Shortfall Default at a market rate of interest for debt of its kind, with payment terms to be determined on the Note Delivery Date so as not to cause Vanguard to default under its then principal credit agreement or any indenture relating to debt securities that are publicly-held or are traded in the Rule 144A market. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon DMC's receipt of the Note, Buyer shall have no further obligations under Sections 12.4(b) through 12.4(f).

  

 **(e) ** In the event the Warrant Certificate remains outstanding on the date which is 60 Business Days after the expiration of the fifth CapEx Year after the Closing, the Warrant Certificate then in the possession of the Escrow Agent shall be delivered to DMC and shall be immediately exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Certificate upon DMC's receipt of such Warrant Certificate; provided, however, in the event Buyer has fully complied with its obligations set forth in Section 12.4(e) and in the first sentence of Section 12.4(d), the Warrant Certificate shall be of no force or effect, shall immediately be returned to Vanguard and immediately cancelled.

  

 **12.6 _Retention of Medical Staff_** ** __**. As of the Closing, Buyer shall permit all members of the Hospitals' medical staffs, whether active, honorary, temporary or otherwise, to retain their current medical staff appointments until the expiration of their current appointments. The foregoing will not limit the ability of Buyer's board of directors or Buyer's medical executive committee to suspend medical staff appointments or clinical privileges in accordance with the terms and provisions of the medical staff bylaws of Buyer. From and after Closing, Buyer will work with the medical staffs of the Hospitals to evaluate, and where feasible, pursue opportunities for medical staff/clinical integration where doing so offers opportunities for advancement in quality and cost-effectiveness of care.

  

 **12.7 _No Sale of Hospitals_** ** __**. For at least ten years from and after the Closing Date and without the consent of Seller, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of the assets constituting one or more of the Hospitals or all or substantially all of Buyer's equity interest in any Subsidiary of Buyer that owns one or more of the Hospitals to any Person, other than in connection with a transfer to a Permitted Transferee. Nothing in this Section shall limit or impair the ability of Buyer (a) to operate and conduct the business of the Hospitals as Buyer sees fit in its sole discretion, subject to its obligations in this Agreement or (b) to sell any assets or property comprising any of the Hospitals so long as Buyer continues to maintain each Hospital as a general acute care hospital that provides the Core Services required to be provided by such Hospital, all as required by Section 12.3.

  

 **12.8 _Commitment to Education Mission_** ** __**. After Closing, Buyer is committed to supporting fully Seller's historic education mission for undergraduate and graduate medical education, nursing education, and allied health services education.

  

 **12.9 _Commitment to Research Mission_** ** __**. Buyer is committed to supporting Seller 's historic research mission. To this end and as of Closing, Buyer will assume Seller's obligations and commitment to Wayne State University pertaining to Wayne State University's arrangements with the National Institutes of Health for the Perinatal Research Branch operation.

  

 **12.10 _Karmanos Cancer Center_** ** __**. Buyer is committed to supporting Seller's historic partnership with the Karmanos Cancer Center. To this end and as of Closing, Buyer will assume all Contracts between Seller and Karmanos Cancer Center.

  

 **12.11 _Health and Wellness Initiatives_** ** __**. After Closing, Buyer shall enhance current health and wellness initiatives, community outreach and prevention programs, and quality improvement programs of Seller.

  

 **12.12 _Supplier Diversity Program_** ** __**. After Closing, Buyer will support fully the Supplier Diversity Program of Seller, a copy of which is attached as  _Schedule 12.12_, in an effort to provide opportunities for minority-owned, women-owned, and Detroit-based businesses to work with and provide goods and services to Buyer and the Hospitals.

  

 **12.13 _Project Genesis_** ** __**. After Closing, Buyer will support the Project Genesis summer employment/internship program for Detroit Public High School students.

  

 **12.14 _Detroit Based Systems_** ** __**. For a period of at least ten years after Closing, Buyer will operate the Hospitals as a Detroit-based system, and will maintain its regional headquarters in Detroit, Michigan.

  

 **12.15 _National Support Centers_** ** __**. If after Closing Vanguard seeks to establish national centers for system support services, the City of Detroit will be given a full opportunity to present to Vanguard proposals for basing such centers in Detroit before Vanguard makes a final decision on where to locate such centers.

  

 **12.16 _Naming Conventions_** ** __**. After Closing Buyer will honor all donor agreements for the naming of buildings, facilities or programs at the Hospitals.

  

 **12.17 _Annual Reporting Requirements_** ** __**. For at least the first six years from and after the Closing Date, on or before 60 days after each anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to DMC a written report that describes in reasonable detail and demonstrates Buyer's performance under and compliance with the covenants of Buyer set forth in this Article 12. Such report will be reviewed pursuant to the agreed upon procedures set forth in _Schedule 12.17_ by an independent certified public accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer; provided, however, that such independent certified public accounting firm will only review Buyer's compliance with Section 12.4. Seller (and its agents and others acting on behalf of Seller) and such independent certified public accounting firm shall have access to the books and records of Buyer and Vanguard for purposes of verifying the information contained in the annual report submitted by Buyer. Each such report shall include, without limitation, information and data pertaining to Buyer's charity care activities, capital expenditures, educational and research mission activities, health and wellness initiatives activities and supplier diversity activities. Additionally and within 30 days after the delivery of each annual report, Vanguard shall make a presentation to the board of trustees of DMC regarding such annual report and Vanguard's plan for and position in the Detroit, Michigan market.

  

 **12.18 _Post Closing Assistance to Seller_** ** __**. 

  

 **(a) ** Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at any time after Closing upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, Buyer will make its records pertaining to the operation of the Hospital Businesses prior to Closing available to Seller in a timely manner. In addition, Buyer will (i) provide reasonable assistance in the gathering and providing of financial information to Seller's accountants as reasonably requested for the preparation of financial statements and Tax Returns for Seller and its Affiliates for periods prior to Closing and (ii) provide such other assistance as Seller may reasonably request in the winding up of its business and affairs as the owner and operator of the Hospital Businesses. 

  

 **(b) ** For 12 months after the Closing Date, Buyer will provide Seller with a reasonable amount of office space and comply with the provisions of Section 12.18(a) at no cost to Seller other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, if any. From and after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its actual reasonable costs of complying with Section 12.18(a). Buyer shall provide such information, cooperation and assistance without warranty of any kind to Seller, including a warranty about the reliability of the contents of such information.

  

 **(c) ** Additionally and as of the Closing Date, DMC and Buyer shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Buyer will (i) employ the employees who will provide services to DMC after Closing for up to 12 months after Closing and DMC will have the right to utilize such employees and will reimburse Buyer for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the employment of such employees (salaries, wages and benefits), (ii) provide reasonable assistance to Seller in connection with Seller's obligations under its provider agreements with Government Payment Programs, including, without limitation, reasonable assistance in the preparation of terminating cost reports and prosecution and defense of claims attendant to such provider agreements, (iii) at no cost to Seller, provide ministerial services in respect of the DMC Non-ERISA 403(b) Plan at a level currently provided by Seller, and (iv) provide such other services as DMC and Buyer may mutually agree. The Transition Services Agreement will otherwise be upon such terms and conditions as are mutually acceptable to DMC and Buyer.

  

 **ARTICLE 13** 
  **OTHER POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS**

  

 **13.1 _Post-Closing Maintenance of and Access to Information_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** The Parties acknowledge that after Closing each Party may need access to information and documents (regardless of medium) in the control or possession of another Party for the purposes of concluding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, preparing Tax Returns or conducting Tax audits, obtaining insurance, complying with the Government Payment Programs and other Legal Requirements, and prosecuting or defending third party claims. Accordingly, each Party shall keep, preserve and maintain in the ordinary course of business, and as required by Legal Requirements and relevant insurance carriers, all books, records (including patient medical records), documents, databases and other information (regardless of medium) in the possession or control of such Party and relevant to the foregoing purposes at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof.  Thereafter, each Party shall notify the other Parties, and offer to the other Parties reasonable access to such documents, prior to the destruction thereof.

  

 **(b) ** Each Party shall cooperate fully with, and make available for inspection and copying by, the other Parties, their employees, agents, counsel and accountants and/or Governmental Authorities, upon written request and at the expense of the requesting Party, such books, records, documents and other information to the extent reasonably necessary to facilitate the foregoing purposes. In addition, each Party shall cooperate with, and shall permit and use its best efforts to cause its former and present trustees, directors, officers and employees to cooperate with, the other Parties on and after Closing in furnishing information, evidence, testimony and other assistance in connection with any action, proceeding, arrangement or dispute of any nature with respect to the subject matters of this Agreement.

  

 **(c) ** The exercise by any Party of any right of access granted herein shall not materially interfere with the business operations of the other Parties.

  

 **13.2 _Cost Reports_** ** __** **. ** Seller, with the reasonable assistance of Buyer, shall prepare and timely file consistent with current laws all Government Payment Program cost reports relating to the Hospitals for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or required as a result of the transfer of the Assets to Buyer and the consummation of the transactions described herein ("Seller Cost Reports"). Buyer shall forward to Seller any and all correspondence relating to the Seller Cost Reports within five Business Days after receipt by Buyer. Buyer shall remit any receipts of funds relating to the Seller Cost Reports promptly after receipt by Buyer (and in all events within ten Business Days after receipt by Buyer) and shall forward to Seller any demand for payments within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Buyer. Seller shall retain all rights and liabilities related to or in respect of the Seller Cost Reports including any amounts receivable or payable in respect of such reports. Such rights shall include, without limitation, the right to appeal any determinations relating to the Seller Cost Reports. Buyer will cooperate with Seller in regard to the preparation, filing, handling, and appeal of any Seller Cost Reports. Such cooperation shall include the providing of statistics regularly maintained by the Hospitals, obtaining copies of files retained at the Hospitals, and coordinating with Seller pursuant to reasonable and adequate notice with respect to Medicare and Medicaid exit conferences or meetings. Seller shall retain the originals of the Seller Cost Reports, correspondence, work papers, and other documents relating to the Seller Cost Reports. Seller will furnish copies of such cost reports, correspondence, work papers, and other documents to Buyer upon request.

  

 **13.3 _Misdirected Payments_** ** __**. If, after Closing, Buyer receives any amount relating to the Seller Cost Reports (whether for discharges occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date), Buyer shall promptly tender such amounts to Seller. As part of the Assets acquired by Buyer hereunder, Buyer, after Closing, shall be entitled to receive from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan all cost report settlements, whether for discharges occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date. After Closing, Seller shall remit to Buyer with reasonable promptness any monies received by Seller after Closing constituting or in respect of the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, including any insurance proceeds. 

  

 **13.4 _Collection of Pre-Closing Receivables and Special Accounts_** ** __**. Buyer shall, as agent for and in the name of Seller and on Seller's behalf, submit and process claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, and, to the extent that only Seller is permitted to directly receive payment, any other Government Payment Programs ("Governmental Payors") for services provided by the Hospital Businesses on or prior to the Closing Date. All of the payments with respect to such claims shall continue to be deposited into Seller's bank accounts (the "Special Accounts"). At least 30 days prior to Closing, Seller shall identify in a written notice to Buyer all Special Accounts and the banks where such accounts are maintained (the "Special Account Banks"). The Special Accounts shall be and remain under the exclusive domain and control of Seller. Seller shall, however, effective as of the Closing Date, enter into and maintain a Depository Agreement with the Special Account Banks relating to the Special Accounts in the form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer ("Depository Agreement") or in such other form as is acceptable to the Special Account Banks, Buyer and Seller, which in any event shall include provisions that: (a) provide for the daily sweep of funds from the Special Accounts into the bank account or accounts designated by Buyer (the "Buyer Account"); (b) provide for the immediate notification by the Special Account Banks to Buyer in the event that Seller terminates or modifies any instructions to the Special Account Banks or the Depository Agreement; and (c) are otherwise consistent with the terms of this Agreement and any other agreement between Buyer and Seller with respect to the Special Accounts, but which shall in no event contravene a Governmental Payor's restrictions on Seller's assignment or reassignment of payments from the Governmental Payor; provided that in the event that such provisions would contravene such restrictions, the Parties shall, to the extent the provisions thereof are permitted by and consistent with applicable Law, use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to amend this Section 13.4 to restore the Parties to the equivalent economic position that they would have been in if such restriction did not exist. After the Closing Date, Sellers shall not: (i) take any actions that interfere with the transfer of funds from the Special Accounts to the Buyer Account as provided in this Section 13.4 and in the Depository Agreement; (ii) remove, withdraw or authorize the removal or withdrawal of any funds from the Special Accounts for any purpose except to accomplish the transfer of funds provided in this Section 13.4 or in the Depository Agreement; (iii) instruct any Governmental Payor to make payments to any account or location other than the Special Accounts; or (iv) take any other actions contrary to the terms of this Section 13.4; and Seller acknowledges and agrees that any such actions will, notwithstanding Seller's ultimate control over the Special Accounts, constitute a material breach of Seller's covenants in favor of Buyer hereunder. Buyer understands and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, amounts relating to settlements of any Seller Cost Reports (including, without limitation, the Net Cost Report Receivable for Medicare cost report years 2008 and 2009 (but subject to the terms of the Advance Agreement described in Section 13.6), but specifically excluding the Net Cost Report Receivable for Medicare cost report year 2010) will not be included in any funds that are transferred to the Buyer Account or otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 13.4.

  

 **13.5 _Cost Report Liabilities_** ** __** **.** Notwithstanding that Seller is retaining all liabilities associated with Seller's provider agreements with the Medicare program (as more particularly set forth in the Excluded Liabilities), Buyer shall reimburse Seller, or otherwise pay at the request of Seller, upon the receipt of supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to Buyer, those liabilities of Seller from and after Closing in respect of any Seller Cost Report adjustments or other amounts payable, in each case to the extent relating to reimbursement for direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) and Medicare disproportionate share payments (collectively, "Resident and DSH Liabilities"); provided, however, in no event shall Buyer's obligations under this Section 13.5 exceed $25,000,000. Although the obligations of Buyer under this Section 13.5 are included among the covenants, agreements and obligations of Buyer described in Section 14.2(a), the liability of Buyer under Section 14.2(a) as it relates solely to this Section 13.5 shall not exceed $25,000,000, it being the intent of the Parties that Buyer shall have no liability under this Section 13.5 or under Section 14.2(a) as it relates solely to this Section 13.5 in excess of such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, such $25,000,000 limitation described in this Section 13.5 shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by amounts actually paid by, or on behalf of, Seller after the Closing in respect of any Resident and DSH Liabilities.

  

 **13.6 _Advances by Buyer_** ** __**. Buyer shall advance amounts to Seller as necessary for Seller to satisfy Seller's obligations under the Excluded Liabilities in an amount not to exceed the aggregate of Net Cost Report Receivable for Medicare cost report years 2008 and 2009 that are taken into consideration in the calculation described in Section 2.5(a)(ii)(B). The amount of any individual advance shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the aggregate of Net Cost Report Receivable for Medicare cost report years 2008 and 2009 on the date that Seller requests the advance or (ii) the difference between the Excluded Liability to be satisfied by Seller and the amount of funds held by Seller that are available to satisfy such Excluded Liabilities. Seller's obligations to repay any advance will be secured by Seller's interest in the Net Cost Report Receivable for Medicare cost report years 2008 and 2009 and shall mature upon the receipt of such Net Cost Report Receivable. The rights and obligations of the Parties in respect of such advances will be set forth in an Advance Agreement that will be upon terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer and Seller in their reasonable good faith discretion and that will be executed and delivered at Closing.

  

 **ARTICLE 14** 
  **INDEMNIFICATION**

  

 **14.1 _Indemnification by Seller_** ** __**. Subject in all events to the terms of Section 2.4, and further subject to the terms of this Article, from and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer's Indemnified Persons, and each of them, from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer's Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly, as a result of or arising from liabilities described in subsections (v), (vi) or (vii) of the definition of Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, Seller's obligations in this sentence shall exclude any Losses for which Buyer is obligated to pay to, or on behalf of, Seller pursuant to Section 13.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject in all events to the terms of Section 2.4, Seller's indemnification obligations contained in this Section 14.1 shall not exceed the amount determined in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(ii)(B)(I) as of the Closing Date _minus_ any amounts paid by Seller after Closing in respect of the liabilities described in subsections (v), (vi) or (vii) of the definition of Excluded Liabilities.

  

 **14.2 _Indemnification by Vanguard and Buyer_** ** __**. In connection with the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities and subject to and to the extent provided in this Article, Vanguard and Buyer shall each, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller's Indemnified Persons, and each of them, from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by Seller's Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly, as a result of or arising from:

  

 **(a) ** The nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other obligation of Vanguard or Buyer set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing Date or in any other agreement or instrument delivered by Vanguard or Buyer at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, except as may be waived by Seller;

  

 **(b) ** The Assumed Liabilities; and

  

 **(c) ** Any liability or claim of Seller arising after the Closing Date under the WARN Act or any state or local counterparts as a result of Buyer's failure to hire any employee or termination after Closing of any employee hired by Buyer in accordance with Section 6.3.

  

 **14.3 _Notice and Procedure_** ** __**. All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying Party under this Article shall be asserted and resolved as provided in the following provisions of this Article 14.

  

 **14.4 _Notice and Control of Litigation_** ** __**. If any claims or liability for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable for Losses to an Indemnified Party is asserted in writing by a Person other than any Buyer's Indemnified Persons or Seller's Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the same within 30 days after receipt of such written assertion of a claim or liability. Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to this Article to the extent such failure to notify in the time required above materially adversely affects the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such matter. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within 30 days after notice of such claim that the Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, at its sole cost and risk defend the claim and control the defense, settlement and prosecution of any litigation. If within 30 days after notice of such claim the Indemnifying Party either notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of indemnity with respect to the claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will defend the claim, or if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within such 30 days that the Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against the claim but fails thereafter to diligently prosecute or settle the claim, the Indemnified Party will have the right (but not the obligation) to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim at the cost and risk of the Indemnifying Party. Anything in this Section notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages or other money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its own cost and expense, to defend, compromise and settle such claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability in respect to such claim, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of the claim on behalf of the Indemnified Party if (1) the Persons against whom the claim is made, or any Indemnified Persons, include both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party, and (2) representation of both such Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case any Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend the claim on its own behalf and to employ counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. All Parties agree to cooperate fully as necessary in the defense of such matters (including making any counterclaim or cross-claim against any Person other than another Party). 

  

 **14.5 _Notice of Claim_** ** __**. If an Indemnified Party has a claim against any Indemnifying Party that is not described in Section 14.4, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party describing the claim. Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying Party within the time frame required above, the indemnity with respect to the subject matter of the required notice shall be limited to the damages that would have nonetheless resulted absent the Indemnified Party's failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above after taking into account such actions as could have been taken by the Indemnifying Party had it received timely notice from the Indemnified Party.

  

 **14.6 _Mixed Claims_** ** __**. Notice of any claims composed in part of third party claims and claims that are not third party claims may be given pursuant to either Section 14.4 or14.5, and the giving of a notice under Section 14.4 when a notice is properly due under Section 14.5, or the giving of a notice under Section 14.5 when a notice is properly due under Section 14.4, shall not impair the Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party has been irreparably prejudiced thereby.

  

 **14.7 _Presumption of Liability_** ** __**. If the Indemnifying Party either fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days following its receipt of notice of the claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of indemnity with respect to a claim or assumes the defense of a claim, the claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

  

 **14.8 _Disputed Claims_** ** __**. If the Indemnifying Party timely notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of indemnity with respect to the claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed promptly and in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute within 60 days following receipt of the notice and, if such dispute is not resolved through negotiations during such 60-day period, it shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of Article 15.

  

 **14.9 _Payment of Losses_** ** __**. The Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any Losses to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after notice of the claim is given or on such later date (i) in the case of a claim described in Section 14.4 that the Indemnified Party suffers Losses, or (ii) in the case of a claim described in Section 14.5, promptly after the Indemnified Party suffers Losses in respect of the claim. In the event the Indemnified Party is not paid in full for its claim in a timely manner after the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify and the amount thereof has been determined, the amount due shall bear interest from the date that the Indemnified Party suffered Losses in respect of the claim until paid at the interest rate provided in Section 16.19.

  

 **14.10 _Limitations/DMC Assistance_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** No claim pursuant to this Article 14 may be asserted under this Agreement unless the Indemnified Party making the claim gives the Indemnifying Party against whom the claim is to be made notice of such claim before the end of the applicable survival period (as provided in Section14.11), provided that such claim shall survive the expiration of the survival period if notice thereof, as required hereby, was previously given.

  

 **(b) ** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any amounts which are due and owing from Seller to Buyer after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement may be offset by Buyer against (i) monies due to Seller or (ii) performance to which Seller is otherwise entitled from Buyer, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including Buyer's obligations to Seller under this Article 14. Prior to exercising any such right of offset, Buyer must give Seller written notice of Buyer's intent to exercise such right. Seller shall have a period of 15 Business Days to deliver the amounts due Buyer prior to exercising any right of offset.

  

 **(c) ** From and after Closing, DMC shall reasonably assist and cooperate with Buyer in Buyer's efforts to pursue claims and enforce rights against third parties relating to events and circumstances that occurred prior to Closing and to defend against claims asserted by third parties relating to events and circumstance that occurred prior to Closing. DMC will not be required to expend any funds in connection with such cooperation and assistance.

  

 **14.11 _Survival_** ** __**. Notwithstanding any right of Seller to investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Buyer and Vanguard contained in this Agreement, Seller has the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Buyer and Vanguard contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any right of Buyer or Vanguard to investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Buyer and Vanguard have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement. The representations and warranties of each of Seller, Buyer and Vanguard contained herein shall remain in full force and effect until the Closing has occurred, and such representations and warranties shall expire upon, and be of no force or effect after, the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements (other than representations and warranties) in this Agreement made by Seller, Buyer and Vanguard shall survive the Closing indefinitely, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.

In the event of a dispute between the Parties arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Parties shall utilize the procedures specified in this Article except (a) when otherwise modified by written agreement of the Parties at the time or after such time the dispute arises; (b) for any dispute that relates to the exercise of a right to terminate the Agreement, (c) for any dispute that arises out of a third party lawsuit, (e.g., a potential cross-claim), notwithstanding that the dispute otherwise arises under the Agreement, (d) as necessary to allow any Party to exercise its remedy of specific performance under this Agreement, (e) as necessary to allow either Party to pursue injunctive relief, or (f) when otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

 **15.2 _Initiation of the Procedure_** ** __**.

The Party receiving such notice (the "Responding Party") shall have ten days within which to designate, in a written notice given to the Initiating Party, an individual with authority to settle the dispute on its behalf. The individuals so designated shall be known as the "Authorized Individuals."

  

 **15.3 _Unassisted Settlement_** ** __**. The Authorized Individuals shall make such investigations as they deem appropriate and promptly thereafter (but in no event later than 15 days from the date of designation of the Responding Party's Authorized Individual) shall commence discussions concerning resolution of the dispute. If the dispute has not been resolved within 55 days from the date that the Initiating Party gave written notice pursuant to Section 15.2 (such 55th day being the "Submission Date"), it shall be submitted to alternative dispute resolution (the "ADR") as provided below.

  

 **15.4 _Selection of the Neutral_** ** __**. The Parties shall have ten days from the Submission Date to select a mutually acceptable Person who is not an Affiliate or employee of any Party to resolve the dispute (the "Neutral"). If no Neutral has been selected within such time, any Party to the dispute may request that the American Arbitration Association, the Center for Public Resources, or another mutually agreed-upon provider of neutral dispute resolution services, supply within ten days a list of potential Neutrals with qualifications specified by the Parties. Within five days after receipt of the list, the Parties shall independently rank the proposed candidates, simultaneously exchange rankings and select as the Neutral the individual receiving the highest combined ranking who is available to serve.

  

 **15.5 _Time and Place for the ADR_** ** __**. In consultation with the Neutral, the Parties shall promptly designate a mutually convenient time and place for the ADR in Detroit, Michigan (and unless circumstances require otherwise, such time shall be no later than 60 days after selection of the Neutral).

  

 **15.6 _Exchange of Information_** ** __**. In the event any Party has a substantial need for information in the possession of the other Party in order to prepare for the ADR, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree on procedures for the expeditious exchange of such information, with the help of the Neutral if necessary.

In addition, each Party may bring such other Persons (the maximum number of which shall be agreed upon by the Parties in advance) as may be needed to respond to questions, contribute information and participate in the negotiations, with the assistance of the Neutral, if necessary.

  

 **15.9 _Conduct of the ADR_** ** __**. The Parties, in consultation with the Neutral, will agree upon a format for the meetings designed to assure that the Neutral and the Authorized Individuals have an opportunity to hear an oral presentation of each Party's views on the matter in dispute, and that the Authorized Individuals attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter in dispute, with or without the assistance of counsel or others, but with the assistance of the Neutral. To this end, the Neutral is authorized to conduct both joint meetings and separate private caucuses with the Parties. The Neutral will keep confidential all information learned in private caucus with either Party unless specifically authorized by such Party to make disclosure of the information to the other Party.

  

 **15.10 _The Neutral 's Views_** ** __**. The Neutral shall (a) unless requested not to do so by the Parties, provide his opinion to the Parties on the probable outcome should the matter be litigated, and (b) if requested to do so by the Parties, make one or more recommendations as to the terms of a possible settlement, upon any conditions imposed by the Parties (including a minimum and maximum amount). The Neutral shall base his opinions and recommendations on information then available to the Parties, excluding only such information disclosed by any Party to the Neutral in confidence but not disclosed to the other Party or Parties. The opinions and recommendations of the Neutral shall not be binding on the Parties.

  

 **15.11 _Termination of the ADR_** ** __**. The Parties shall participate in the ADR until the ADR is conducted in accordance with Section 15.9 and 15.10 and has concluded (as designated by the Neutral or by a written declaration by a Party to the effect that further efforts at mediation would not contribute to a resolution of the Parties' dispute). The Parties shall not terminate negotiations concerning resolution of the matters in dispute until at least ten days after the conclusion of the ADR. No Party shall commence a lawsuit or seek other remedies prior to the conclusion of the ten-day post-ADR negotiation period, provided that either Party may commence litigation within five days prior to the date after which the commencement of litigation could be barred by an applicable statute of limitations or doctrine of laches, or in order to request a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent irreparable harm, in which event the Parties shall continue nevertheless (unless prohibited by court order) to participate in the post-ADR negotiations to the conclusion of the ten-day post-ADR negotiation period.

  

 **15.12 _Fees of the Neutral; Disqualification_** ** __**. The Parties shall share the fees of the Neutral equally. The Neutral shall be disqualified as a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for either Party with respect to the matters in dispute and any litigation or other matters relating thereto. 

  

 **15.13 _Confidentiality_** ** __**. The ADR is intended to constitute a compromise and/or mediation for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. No stenographic, visual or audio record shall be made of the ADR. All communications, writings, conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions said, prepared or made for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to an ADR by any Party, its agents, employees, representatives or other invitees, and by the Neutral (who will be the Parties' joint agent for purposes of the ADR) are confidential and, where appropriate, shall be deemed to be work product and privileged. Such conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions shall not be discoverable or admissible for any purposes, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding in which testimony can be compelled to be given, and shall not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert, witness or representative of any Party, provided that evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or admission as a result of its use in the ADR.

  

 **ARTICLE 16** 
  **GENERAL**

  

 **16.1 _Schedules_** ** __** ** ** The Schedules (and all supplements to the Schedules and additional Schedules permitted by this Section 16.1) shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any fact disclosed on one Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed on each other applicable Schedule. Nothing in the Schedules shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless it is readily apparent that the Schedule or exception applies to such representation or warranty and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing of a document in a Schedule shall not be deemed to disclose the contents of such document as an exception to any representation or warranty, unless such document has been made available to the other Parties. The disclosure of any information in a Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that such information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties of a Party or that it is material, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a level or standard of materiality for purposes of this Agreement. Any Contracts, documents or other materials delivered by any of Seller or its advisors, or made available, to any of Vanguard and Buyer shall be deemed to be delivered to each of Vanguard and Buyer. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall supplement the Schedules, deliver new Schedules or deliver written disclosures as necessary to make each of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article 3 true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that without Buyer's written consent, (i) Seller may not supplement any Schedule relating to the representations and warranties in Section 3.6 pertaining to the Financial Statements, and (ii) no such supplement or written disclosure shall disclose any circumstance or event that result in or are reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, (iii) Losses of $25,000,000 or more, (iv) an adverse effect on EBITDA of the Hospital Business of at least $10,000,000 on an annualized basis or (v) a breach under the Principal Credit Agreement (assuming that Buyer had consummated the transactions described herein and the underlying facts and circumstances disclosed in such updated Schedule or written disclosure would constitute a breach under the Principal Credit Agreement).

  

 **16.2 _CON Disclaimer_** ** __**. This Agreement shall not be deemed to be an acquisition or obligation of a capital expenditure or of funds within the meaning of the certificate of need laws of any state, until the appropriate Governmental Authorities shall have granted a certificate of need or other appropriate approval or determined that no certificate of need or other approval is required.

  

 **16.3 _Tax and Government Payment Programs Effect_** ** __**. None of the Parties (nor such Parties' counsel or accountants) has made or is making in this Agreement any representation to any other Party (or such Party's counsel or accountants) concerning any of the Tax or Government Payment Programs effects or consequences on the other Party of the transactions provided for in this Agreement. Each Party represents that it has obtained, or may obtain, independent Tax and Government Payment Programs advice with respect thereto and upon which it, if so obtained, has solely relied.

  

 **16.4 _Reproduction of Documents_** ** __**. This Agreement as originally executed and all documents relating hereto, including consents, waivers and modifications which may hereafter be executed, the Closing Documents, financial statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished to any Party, may be reproduced by any Party by any photographic, microfilm, electronic or similar process and the Parties may destroy any original documents so reproduced. The Parties stipulate that any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in the ordinary course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence; provided that an originally executed copy of the Agreement or any other such document shall control over any purported reproduction thereof to the extent of any differences between the two.

  

 **16.5 _Consented Assignment_** ** __**. Subject to the terms of Section 5.5(b) and 9.3(f), Buyer shall assume the risk that an attempted assignment of any Assumed Contract, claim or right without the consent of the counterparty thereto would be ineffective or would materially affect Buyer's rights thereunder such that Buyer would not in fact receive all the rights of Seller thereunder. If an attempted assignment without the consent of the counterparty to an Assumed Contract, claim or right would be ineffective or would materially affect the rights thereunder of Seller so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide Buyer the benefits under any such Assumed Contract, claim or right, including enforcement of any and all rights of Seller against the other Person arising out of the breach or cancellation by such other Person or otherwise. After Closing, the Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the consent to the assignment of such Contract, claim or right.

  

 **16.6 _Time of Essence_** ** __**. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement, provided that if the day on or by which a notice must or may be given or the performance of any Party's obligation is due is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday for banks in Detroit, Michigan, then the day on or by which such notice is due must or may be extended to the first Business Day thereafter. This Section 16.6 may be waived only in a writing expressly referring hereto. 

  

 **16.7 _Consents, Approvals and Discretion_** ** __**. Except as herein expressly provided to the contrary, whenever this Agreement requires any consent or approval to be given by any Party or any Party must or may exercise discretion, such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such discretion shall be reasonably exercised. DMC shall have the right and authority to consent on behalf of each Seller and Vanguard shall have the right and authority to consent on behalf of each Buyer.

  

 **16.8 ** **_Choice of Law; Forum_** ** __**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan without regard to such State's conflicts of laws rules, and all remedies for dispute resolution arising under this Agreement, including mediation, shall be conducted in Detroit, Michigan.

  

 **16.9 _Benefit; Assignment_** ** __**. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their legal representatives, successors and assigns. No Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, after Closing, DMC may assign all or any part of its restricted endowment funds and up to $4,500,000 of other assets to another nonprofit tax-exempt Person without subjecting such Person to any obligation or duty hereunder, without the consent of Buyer or Vanguard so long as (a) DMC provides prior written notice thereof to Vanguard, (b) such assignment by DMC shall not relieve DMC of its obligations hereunder and (c) such Person, if considered to be a Seller in Section 11.2, would not be in violation of Section 11.2 immediately prior to such assignment. Alternatively, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, after Closing, DMC may assign all or substantially all of its assets except its restricted endowment funds and up to $4,500,000 of other assets to another nonprofit tax-exempt Person whose board of trustees includes substantially the same individuals who are members of the board of trustees of DMC on the date of such assignment in conjunction with the delegation by DMC of all of its obligations and duties hereunder to such Person, with the effect of relieving DMC of its obligations hereunder, without the consent of Buyer or Vanguard so long as (x) DMC provides prior written notice thereof to Vanguard, (y) the Person to which funds, rights and obligations have been transferred agrees in writing to be fully bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (z) such Person, if considered to be a Seller in Section 11.2 would not be in violation of Section 11.2 immediately prior to such assignment.  Additionally, after Closing DMC may assign its rights to enforce the obligations of Buyer and Vanguard hereunder and its right to appoint members of the board of directors of VHS Michigan Advisory Board to any Person whose board of trustees includes substantially the same individuals who are members of the board of trustees of DMC on the date of such assignment without the consent of Buyer or Vanguard. At the request of Buyer prior to Closing, Seller shall transfer portions of the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to those wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Buyer designated in writing to Seller (the "Buyer Entities"). Upon the transfer of any Assets to a Buyer Entity, and in consideration thereof, such Buyer Entity shall be deemed to be a party hereto and shall be bound by and subject to the obligations of Buyer hereunder. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.11, the Buyer Entities shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

  

 **16.10 _Other Owners of the Assets_** ** __**. For purposes of all representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained herein, (a) Seller's obligations with respect to any Assets shall be joint and several with any wholly-owned Affiliate of Seller which is not a party to this Agreement, but which owns or controls any Assets (an "Other Asset Holding Entity"), (b) Seller's representations and warranties herein, to the extent applicable, shall be deemed to have been made by, on behalf of and with respect to, any such Other Asset Holding Entity in its ownership capacity, and (c) Seller has the legal capacity to cause, and it shall cause, any Other Asset Holding Entity to satisfy all of Seller's obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Assets. Seller hereby waives any defense to a claim made by Buyer under this Agreement based on the failure of any person who owns or controls the Assets, including any Other Asset Holding Entity, to be a party to this Agreement.

  

 **16.11 _Third Party Beneficiary_** ** __**. The terms and provisions of this Agreement (including provisions regarding employee and employee benefit matters) are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties, Seller's Indemnified Persons with respect to Article 14, the Buyer's Indemnified Persons with respect to Article 14, the Buyer Entities and, in each instance, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person. Any reference in this Agreement to one or more Seller Employee Benefit Plans includes provisions, if any, in such plans permitting their termination or amendment and any covenant in this Agreement to provide any Seller Employee Benefit Plans shall not be deemed or construed to limit (subject to Section 6.3(a)) the right of Buyer to terminate or amend such plan in accordance with its terms.

  

 **16.12 _Legal Fees and Costs_** ** __** **.** In the event any Party elects to incur legal expenses to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement by judicial means, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover such legal expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, costs and necessary disbursements, in addition to any other relief to which such Party shall be entitled.

  

 **16.13 _Enforcement of Agreement/Specific Performance_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically any term or provision hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled hereunder, at law or in equity.

  

 **(b) ** This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against, the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns as permitted hereunder, and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, trustee, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney or representative of any Party hereto shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth in a written agreement to which such other Person or entity is a party.

  

 **16.14 _Waiver of Breach, Right or Remedy_** ** __**. The waiver by any Party of any breach or violation by another Party of any provision of this Agreement or of any right or remedy permitted the waiving Party in this Agreement (a) shall not waive or be construed to waive any subsequent breach or violation of the same provision (b) shall not waive or be construed to waive a breach or violation of any other provision, and (c) shall be in writing and may not be presumed or inferred from any Party's conduct. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement and except for the obligation of the Parties to first utilize the ADR procedure in Article 15, no remedy conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be in addition to every other remedy granted in this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise.  The election of any one or more remedies by a Party shall not constitute a waiver of the right to pursue other available remedies. In addition to any other rights and remedies any Party may have at law or in equity for breach of this Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 **16.5 _Notices_** ** __**. Any notice, demand or communication required, permitted or desired to be given hereunder shall be deemed effectively given if given in writing (a) on the date tendered by personal delivery; or (b) on the date tendered for delivery by nationally recognized overnight courier or (c) on the date received by telegraphic or other electronic means (including facsimile transmission), in any event addressed as follows:

 **16.16 _Severability_** ** __**. If any provision of this Agreement is held or determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby: (a) such provision will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement; (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  

 **16.17 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_** ** __**. This Agreement supersedes all previous contracts, agreements and understandings and constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature existing between or among the Parties representing the within subject matter and no Party shall be entitled to benefits other than those specified herein. As between or among the Parties, any oral or written representation, agreement or statement not expressly incorporated herein, whether given prior to or on the Effective Date, shall be of no force and effect unless and until made in writing and signed by DMC, on behalf of each Seller, and Vanguard, on behalf of each Buyer and Vanguard, on or after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that any written disclosure delivered to, and acknowledged in writing by, Buyer on the Effective Date that references this Section 16.17 shall constitute a part of this Agreement. A written disclosure, provided in accordance with the previous sentence, that references a specific Section of this Agreement shall be as effective as a Schedule identifying such Section or a disclosure in respect of such Section. To the extent that there is any conflict between such written disclosure and this Agreement, the terms of such written disclosure shall control. Except as permitted by Section 16.1, this Agreement (including any Schedules and Exhibits thereto) may not be amended except in a written instrument executed by DMC, on behalf of each Seller, and Vanguard, on behalf of each Buyer and Vanguard.

  

 **16.18 _Multiple Counterparts_** ** __** **.** This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. The facsimile signature of any Party to this Agreement or any Contract delivered in connection with the consummation of the transactions described herein or a PDF copy of the signature of any Party to this Agreement or any Contract delivered in connection with the consummation of the transactions described herein delivered by electronic mail for purposes of execution or otherwise, is to be considered to have the same binding effect as the delivery of an original signature on an original Contract.

  

 **16.19 _Interest_** ** __**. Unless otherwise provided herein to the contrary, any monies required to be paid by any Party to another Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be due two Business Days after demand therefore and if not paid when due shall accrue interest from and after the due date to and including the date full payment is made at an annual rate equal to the prime rate in effect for the relevant period as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ under "Money Rates."

  

 **16.20 _Drafting_** ** __**. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted for or against any Person on the basis that such Person was the draftsman of such provision, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  

 **16.21 _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_** ** __**.

  

 **(a) ** Except for disclosure required by the applicable securities laws or other Legal Requirements, with respect to information provided by Seller and Buyer in connection with and relative to this proposed transaction, the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated September 17, 2009, in respect of confidentiality between Vanguard and Seller shall remain in effect until Closing.

  

 **(b) ** At all times before the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will consult with the other before issuing or making any reports, statements or releases to the public with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and will use good faith efforts to obtain the other Party's approval of the text of any public report, statement or release to be made on behalf of such Party. If either Party is unable to obtain the approval of its public report, statement or release from the other Party and such report, statement or release is, in the opinion of legal counsel to such Party, necessary to discharge such Party's disclosure obligations under Law, then such Party may make or issue the legally required report, statement or release and promptly furnish the other Party a copy thereof. Buyer understands and acknowledges that Seller will provide a copy of this Agreement to the Attorney General and that the Attorney General may disclose this Agreement to the public at large.

  

 **16.22 _Authority of DMC and Vanguard_** ** __**. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, DMC, on behalf of Seller, and Vanguard, on behalf of Buyer and Vanguard, shall have the authority to enter into amendments or modifications hereto, letter agreements pertaining hereto and grant or withhold consent as provided or permitted hereunder without the need to obtain the signature of any other Parties hereto. Each of DMC and Vanguard represent and warrant to the other that it has the power and authority to act on behalf of its Affiliates that are Parties hereto for all such purposes.

  

 **ARTICLE 17** 
  **GUARANTEE OF BUYER 'S OBLIGATIONS**

  

 Vanguard, as principle obligor and not merely as a surety, hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees the full, punctual and complete performance by Buyer of all of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Closing Documents subject to the terms hereof and thereof, and so undertakes to Seller that, if and whenever Buyer is in default, Vanguard will on demand from Seller duly and promptly perform or procure the performance of Buyer's obligations. The foregoing guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will remain in full force and effect until the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement have been duly performed or discharged and the obligations of Vanguard shall not be affected, modified, or impaired for any reason, including, without limitation, upon the happening from time to time of any of the following events, whether or not with notice to or the consent of Vanguard:

  

 **(a) ** The compromise, settlement, release, change, modification, or amendment (except to the extent of such compromise, settlement release, change, modification, or amendment) of any or all of the obligations, duties, covenants, or agreements of any Party under this Agreement or any Closing Document;

  

 **(b) ** The extension of the time for performance of payment of money pursuant to this Agreement, or of the time for performance of any other obligations, covenants, or agreements under or arising out of this Agreement or any Closing Documents or the extension or the renewal thereof; and

  

 **(c) ** The institution of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against or by Buyer, or the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, sale, or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Buyer.

  

The guarantee set forth in this Article shall continue to be effective or will
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of obligations
by Buyer is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Seller upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of Buyer or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made. The obligations of Vanguard hereunder
are independent of the obligations of Buyer, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against Vanguard without first pursuing any
claims against Buyer.
