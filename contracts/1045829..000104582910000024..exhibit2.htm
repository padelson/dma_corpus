shall mature upon the receipt of such Net Cost Report Receivable.&nbsp; The&nbsp;rights and obligations of the Parties in respect of such advances will be set forth in an Advance Agreement that will be upon terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer and Seller in
their reasonable good faith discretion and that will be executed and delivered at Closing.</p>

assertion of a claim or liability.&nbsp; Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to this Article to the extent such failure to notify in the

Indemnified Party against the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, at its sole cost and risk defend the claim and control the defense, settlement and prosecution of any litigation.&nbsp; If within 30 days after notice of such claim the Indemnifying Party either
notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of indemnity with respect to the claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will defend the claim, or if the Indemnifying Party notifies the

(2)&nbsp;representation of both such Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case any Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend the claim on its own behalf and to employ counsel

reorganization of Buyer or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.&nbsp; The obligations of Vanguard hereunder are independent of the obligations of Buyer, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Vanguard without first
