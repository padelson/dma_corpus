Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the sum of the Adjusted

contemplated by the Formation and Contribution Agreement and the Unit Purchase
Agreement had not occurred.

" _Baseline Working Capital_ " is equal to the sum of the Adjusted Working
Capital as of the end of each of the twelve months ending on the latest
calendar month prior to the Closing for which a balance sheet of the Company

Contribution Agreement and provided that any intercompany accounts between the
Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and NewCo and its subsidiaries,
on the other hand, are eliminated through consolidation) divided by

such appraiser to be chosen by the President of the American Arbitration
Association), with such appraiser allocating the Total Value by the relative
values of the Company and NewCo immediately preceding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Unit Purchase Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (as defined in the Unit Purchase Agreement), and such
appraiser shall complete and deliver to the parties such allocation within 30
days after its appointment. The allocation of the Total Value determined
pursuant to either (i) or (ii) above shall be final, non-appealable and
binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error or fraud and shall be
referred to herein as the " _Final Allocation_ ". Dow Jones and Reuters each
agree to report (and to cause their respective affiliates to report) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Unit Purchase Agreement and

faith prepare and deliver to Reuters a statement (the " _Closing Statement_
") indicating NewCos calculation of the Purchase Price and the components
thereof, together with reasonable supporting detail (all calculations shall be
done in the same manner as set forth in Section 1.3 and Schedule I). The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, applied in a manner consistent with NewCos financial
statements, including NewCos (and not Reuters or Dow Jones or DJBIs)
accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications,



 

\- 4 - valuation techniques and procedures, judgments, thresholds and estimation
methodology reflected or assumed therein, it being understood and agreed
that, for purposes of determining the Cash Balance and Adjusted Working
Capital, any amounts stated in a currency other than Dollars shall be
converted into Dollars in accordance with the methodology described in the
definitions of "Cash Balance" and "Adjusted Working Capital".

(b) _Purchase Price Audit Period_. After receipt of the Closing Statement,
Reuters shall have 30 days to review the Closing Statement, together with the
work papers used in the preparation thereof. Dow Jones shall (i) provide
Reuters and its representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to all relevant work papers, trial balances and other financial
information to the extent necessary or useful to complete the review of the
Closing Statement, and (ii) cooperate with Reuters and its representatives
reasonable requests with respect to the review of the Closing Statement,
including by providing on a timely basis all information necessary or useful
in reviewing the Closing Statement. Unless Reuters delivers written notice to
Dow Jones on or prior to the 30th day after Reuters receipt of the Closing
Statement specifying in reasonable detail the amount, nature and basis of all
disputed items, Reuters shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
the calculation of the Purchase Price set forth on the Closing Statement. If
Reuters notifies Dow Jones of its objection to the calculation of Purchase
Price as set forth on the Closing Statement, Dow Jones and Reuters shall,
within 30 days (or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing)
following such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their
differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive (other than as a result of manifest error or
fraud).

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period,
there are any amounts remaining in dispute, then such amounts remaining in
dispute shall be submitted to an accounting firm of national standing mutually
agreed to by Dow Jones and Reuters in good faith (the " _Neutral Auditors_
"). If Dow Jones and Reuters do not agree in good faith within ten days of the
end of the Resolution Period, the Neutral Auditors shall be chosen by the
President of the American Arbitration Association. The Neutral Auditors
shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of
this Section 1.6 and the presentations by Dow Jones and Reuters, and not by
independent review, only those issues still in dispute. Dow Jones and Reuters
shall instruct the Neutral Auditors to make its determination within 30 days
of the dispute being submitted for their determination and that the Neutral
Auditors determination shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to
Dow Jones and Reuters and the Neutral Auditors determination shall be final,
non-appealable and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error or
fraud. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be entered upon the
Neutral Auditors determination. The Neutral Auditors shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over, and resort to the Neutral Auditors as provided in this
Section 1.6(c) shall be the only recourse and remedy of the parties against
one another with respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating to the
adjustments pursuant to this Section 1.6. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Neutral Auditors shall be paid by Dow Jones, on the one hand, and Reuters, on
the other hand, in inverse proportion (based on value) as Dow 



 

\- 5 - Jones and Reuters, respectively, prevail on any disputed matters, as
determined by the Neutral Auditors. The term " _Final Closing Statement_ "
shall mean the definitive Closing Statement agreed to (or deemed to be agreed
to) by Dow Jones and Reuters in accordance with Section 1.6(b) or resulting
from the determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this
Section 1.6(c) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Dow Jones
and Reuters). The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Purchase Price set
forth in the Final Closing Statement.

(d) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. If the Estimated Purchase Price paid by Buyer
exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay Buyer within five
business days of the date the Purchase Price became the Final Purchase Price,
an amount equal to such excess (plus interest on such excess at the prime
rate, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated from and
including the Closing Date until but excluding the date of such settlement).
If the Estimated Purchase Price paid by Buyer is less than the amount of the
Final Purchase Price, then Dow Jones shall cause Buyer to pay Seller within
five business days of the date the Purchase Price became the Final Purchase
Price, an amount equal to such deficiency (plus interest on such deficiency at
the prime rate, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated
from and including the Closing Date until but excluding the date of such
settlement).

1.7. _Buyer_. No later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, Dow
Jones shall designate in writing to Reuters the name and jurisdiction of
organization of each Buyer. If Dow Jones designates more than one Buyer, such
designation shall also include the allocation of Shares among the Buyers.

\- 10 - 4.5. _Settlement of Intercompany Accounts_.

(a) Reuters and Dow Jones agree to prepare and deliver a schedule of the
Seller Settlement Amount and the Buyer Settlement Amount, calculated as of
the Closing Date, five business days prior to Closing. To the extent that
Reuters and Dow Jones are unable to agree on such schedule, each item in
dispute shall be excluded from such schedule (the " _Excluded Items_ ") for
purposes of the payments to be made on the business day prior to the Closing
Date set forth below (and, for the sake of clarity, any such Excluded Items
shall be excluded from calculating the estimated Adjusted Working Capital at
the Closing but shall be taken into account in calculating the Final Adjusted
Working Capital). On the business day prior to the Closing Date, Dow Jones and
Reuters agree that:

(i) If the Seller Settlement Amount is a positive number, Dow Jones and
Reuters shall cause NewCo to pay to Seller the Seller Settlement Amount;

(ii) If the Seller Settlement Amount is a negative number, Seller shall pay to
NewCo the Seller Settlement Amount; 

(iii) If the Buyer Settlement Amount is a positive number, Dow Jones may elect
to have NewCo pay to Buyer the Buyer Settlement Amount. If Dow Jones does not
so elect, NewCo will be deemed to have paid such amount to Buyer for purposes
of all purchase price adjustments set forth in Article 1 of this Agreement;
and

(iv) If the Buyer Settlement Amount is a negative number, Dow Jones may elect
to cause Buyer to pay to NewCo the Buyer Settlement Amount. If Dow Jones does
not so elect, Buyer will be deemed to have paid such amount to NewCo for
purposes of all calculations to be made under this Agreement.

Dow Jones and Reuters agree that all inter-company amounts included in the
calculation of the Seller Settlement Amount (other than the Excluded Items)
shall be deemed fully satisfied at Closing.

(b) Each of Dow Jones and Reuters acknowledges and agrees that it shall be
solely responsible for all taxes (including without limitation any
withholding taxes at either NewCo or any subsidiary thereof) on, or arising
out of, or relating to, the payment or the funding of the amounts in
accordance with this Agreement.

(c) _Changes in Structure_. At the request of the either Reuters or Dow Jones,
Reuters and Dow Jones each agree to cooperate with each other on considering
alternatives to the transactions set forth in Section 4.5(a) above. Reuters
and Dow Jones each agree to change the structure of any of these transactions
suggested by the other if



 

\- 11 - such change (i) is consistent with the purpose of such transactions and (ii)
would have at most a _de minimis_ adverse effect, financial or otherwise, on
it and its affiliates (including, in the case of Dow Jones, the Factiva
Group).

4.6. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

(a) _Non-Competition_. Reuters hereby agrees that, for a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of 24 months thereafter and
December 31, 2008 (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), none of Reuters, Reuters
Group PLC, or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Reuters Group_ "),
directly or indirectly, shall own any interest in, engage in, conduct or
operate, or allow the use of its trademarks for the purpose of branding, any
service anywhere in the world that provides non-real time (i.e., such service
does not include any substantial real-time content), subscription and/or fixed
fee based (as opposed to free or advertising and/or transactional based)
electronic information research services that:

(i) consist primarily of archival and/or current awareness (i) news from
Reuters Group and (ii) content from multiple third-party newswires,
newspapers, periodicals or trade publications, which third-party content
excluding content that is, or a substantially identical copy of which is,
freely available over the internet substantially contemporaneously with a
user being able to access such content over the Restricted Service (as
defined below), comprises at least 20% of the content of the service; and

(ii) are designed primarily for use by, or are primarily marketed to, business
and information professionals (excluding financial professionals, meaning
anyone primarily involved in trading operations, investor relations or
corporate finance or treasury) in for-profit business enterprises in their
professional capacity (excluding any for-profit business enterprises (x)
primarily involved in banking, lending, insurance, financial markets,
financial services, or otherwise in the financial industry, or (y) primarily
involved in media (i.e., enterprises that generate and/or distribute
content)); and

(iii) compete directly with products and services of the Company commercially
available as of the date hereof in a manner that would result in or would be
reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial condition or results of operations (including as the same
may be integrated into the operations of Buyer after the Closing Date) in the
Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) or Asia/Pacific (all of
the foregoing collectively, the " _Restricted Services_ ").

For the purpose of this Section 4.6(a) "Subsidiaries" shall mean direct or
indirect, majority-owned subsidiaries of Reuters Group PLC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 4.6(a) shall
be deemed to prohibit Reuters, Reuters Group PLC or any of its Subsidiaries
from:

(v) continuing to operate their respective businesses as currently operated;



 

\- 12 - (w) distributing their content to or through third parties, other than as may
be expressly restricted under any other agreement between them and NewCo, Dow
Jones or their affiliates;

(x) integrating any third-party services or products into or with Reuters
Group services or products at the request of a customer;

(y) owning, solely as a passive investment, shares of capital stock or other
interests of any entity, so long as, in the aggregate, Reuters Group do not
thereby beneficially own in the aggregate five percent (5%) or more of the
outstanding shares or other equity interests of such entity; or

(z) acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or stock
or otherwise, of any business, entity or group of entities that engages in
Restricted Services, provided that the gross revenue received by the business,
entity or group of entities from the Restricted Services does not exceed
twenty five percent (25%) of the total gross revenue of the business, entity
or group of entities, as applicable, during the 12-month period prior to the
acquisition of such business, entity or group of entities; provided, however
that Reuters Group and its affiliates shall not add, or license in connection
with or in contemplation of such acquisition, any news produced or owned by
Reuters Group or its affiliates to Restricted Services engaged in or by such
business, entity or group of entities during the Non-Competition Period.

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. Reuters hereby agrees that neither Reuters Group nor
any of its affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, (i) from and after the
date hereof until the end of the Non-Competition Period, solicit for
employment any employee previously agreed to by Reuters and Dow Jones and (ii)
from and after the date hereof until the end of the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _No Hire Period_ "), hire any employee in the subset of
employees in clause (i) previously agreed to by Reuters and Dow Jones. The
foregoing provisions of this Section 4.7(b) will not apply to (x) general
solicitations (including through the use of advertising or search firms) that
does not target such employees, (y) the hiring of any employee (other than,
during the No Hire Period, those employees in the subset of employees
referred to in clause (ii) above) who approaches or initiates a discussion
regarding employment with Reuters Group or any of its affiliates (including
any discussions subsequent to such approach or initiation), including as a
result of a solicitation permitted by clause (x) or (z), or (z) the
solicitation of any such employee who is no longer employed by Dow Jones or
its affiliates.

(c) _Acknowledgements_. Reuters acknowledges and agrees that money damages
would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 4.6 and that
Dow Jones and DJBI shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or
other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach, and Reuters further
agrees to waive any



 

\- 13 - requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach
of this Section 4.6 but shall be in addition to all other remedies available
to Dow Jones, or DJBI, at law or in equity.

(d) _Savings Clause_. If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.6
is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because
it is too broad or extends for too long of a period, then such restriction
shall nevertheless remain effective but shall be considered amended to have
the broadest terms or shortest period of time which such court may find
enforceable.

4.7. _Taxes_. For one year after the Closing, Dow Jones, DJBI and Reuters
agree not to take any action (and Dow Jones and DJBI agree to cause NewCo not
to take any action) that would cause the Dow Jones Contribution (as that term
is defined in the Formation and Contribution Agreement) and the Reuters
Contribution (as that term is defined in the Formation and Contribution
Agreement) to fail to qualify as a transaction governed by Section 351 of the
Code, it being understood that any transaction involving a purchase by Dow
Jones (or offer to purchase by Dow Jones) of the Preferred Shares shall not
be a transaction prohibited by this Section 4.7.

4.8. _Software Licenses_. Each of Dow Jones and Reuters agree that
where reasonably practicable Reuters will include the Company and NewCo as a
licensee under the existing Reuters license for the Licenses (as such term is
defined in the SLA Agreement) (the "Software Licenses") and sufficient to
provide the Company and NewCo or their respective subsidiaries with the
software and other products as are currently provided to the Company under the
Licenses; however the Company and NewCo will be required to pay to Reuters or
the relevant member of the Reuters Group any additional license fees payable
by Reuters under the relevant licenses (approved by and reasonably acceptable
to Dow Jones) in relation to such use. To the extent that Reuters is unable to
include the Company and NewCo as a licensee for the relevant Software
Licenses, the Company and NewCo will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and license the relevant Software Licenses directly (the " _Substitute
Licenses_ ")

promptly notify Reuters, NewCo or Dow Jones, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Partys
claim for indemnification with respect thereto promptly after obtaining
notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, that failure to promptly give such
notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations under this Article 7, except (and then only to the extent that)
the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the

(20) days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice of the Third Party
Claim.

provided is monetary damages as to which the Indemnifying Party shall pay.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the

Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense thereof and employ
counsel as provided above or (ii) the named parties to any such Third Party
Claim (including impleaded parties) include the Indemnified Party or
its affiliates and the Indemnifying Party or its affiliates, and the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or

Party shall not in any event be responsible hereunder for the fees and
expenses of more than one law firm retained by all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third Party Claim in the same jurisdiction.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified
Party under clause (a) above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such
claim in such manner as it reasonably deems appropriate. The Indemnified Party
may not settle such claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned.



 

\- 19 - (f) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith with the Indemnifying
Party and its representatives (including, without limitation, its counsel) in
