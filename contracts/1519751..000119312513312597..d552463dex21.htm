ARTICLE II

 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; CLOSING

2.1 Purchase of the Membership Interests. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and upon the basis of the agreements, representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Sellers shall
sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from Sellers,
the Membership Interests for the consideration specified in _Section 2.3_
below.

2.2 The Closing. The Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on the
Closing Date. The Closing may be accomplished by telecopy or electronic mail
exchange of signature pages with originals to follow by overnight delivery, or
in such other manner or at such other place as the Parties hereto may agree.
The Contemplated Transactions (other than the Pre-Closing Reorganization) will
be deemed to be effective at the Effective Time.

2.3 Consideration. As consideration for the purchase of the Membership
Interests, Purchaser agrees to pay to Sellers at the Closing the Purchase
Price as follows:

 

(a) _Closing Payment_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Closing
Payment to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by Sellers.

(b) _Holdback Amounts_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Working
Capital Holdback Amount and the Indemnity Holdback Amount to the Escrow Agent,
each to be held pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section
2.5_.

 

(c) _Payment and Holdback Allocations_. The Purchase Price shall be paid to
Sellers in accordance with the percentage allocations set forth on _Schedule
2.3(c)_. The Working Capital Holdback Amount and the Indemnity Holdback
Amount, each shall be retained from the Purchase Price and held by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the percentage allocations set forth on  _Schedule
2.3(c)_.

 



16 (d) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price (and all other
capitalizable costs) shall be allocated for income Tax purposes among the
assets of the Company in accordance with the principles and assumptions that
underlie the preliminary allocation of Purchase Price contained on _Schedule
2.3(d)_. Contemporaneously with Purchasers delivery of the Closing Balance
Sheet and related documents described in _Section 2.4(a)_, Purchaser shall
deliver to Sellers Purchasers proposed allocation of Purchase Price which
shall be prepared in a fashion consistent with _Schedule 2.3(d)_ based upon
figures reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and any other relevant
financial data (" _Proposed Allocation of Purchase Price_ "). Any objections
that any Seller has to the Proposed Allocation of Purchase Price shall be
raised in a fashion that is consistent with the procedures specified in
_Section 2.4_, and any disputes relating to such issues shall be resolved
using the procedures specified in  _Section 2.4_. The final determination of
the proper allocation of Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs)
shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Allocation of Purchase Price._ "
The Final Allocation of Purchase Price shall be used by all Parties for all
income Tax purposes and in all income Tax filings, declarations and reports,
including any reports required to be filed under Section 1060 of the Code
(such as IRS Form 8594). In any action, suit, investigation or proceeding
related to the determination of income Tax, neither Purchaser nor Sellers
shall contend or represent that such allocation is not a correct allocation.
The Final Allocation of Purchase Price shall be revised, as appropriate, if
the Purchase Price is adjusted, as provided for hereunder.

2.4 Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Adjustments_. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ") together with a schedule (the " _Closing Date
Schedule_ ") setting forth Purchasers calculation of (i) the Cash as of the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Date Cash_ "); (ii) the Company Indebtedness as
of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Date Company Indebtedness_ "); (iii)
the Closing Net Working Capital; and (iv) the Target Net Working Capital,
based on entries set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet, in each case prepared
in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the classification in the
audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31,
2012. The Closing Date Schedule shall be accompanied by detailed schedules
supporting each such calculation. For illustrative purposes, an example of
how Closing Net Working Capital is calculated is attached hereto as _Schedule
2.4(a)_.

(b) _Resolution_. After the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date Schedule and until such time as the Purchase Price Adjustments
are determined in accordance with this _Section 2.4_, Sellers and their
advisors shall have access during reasonable business hours upon prior
written notice to the working papers of Purchaser and its agents and advisors
relating to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule and the
calculations set forth thereon, and shall be afforded reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, to the personnel, books and
records of the Company, the Subsidiaries and their accountants to the extent
relevant to the review of such Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Date Schedule. Unless Sellers, within sixty (60) days after receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and

 



17 _ _ the Closing Date Schedule, gives Purchaser a notice objecting thereto and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the basis for each such objection and the
amount in dispute (" _Notice of Objection_ "), such Closing Balance Sheet,
Closing Date Schedule and the Purchase Price Adjustments resulting therefrom
shall be final and binding upon all of the Parties hereto, except in the case
of manifest error or fraud. If a timely Notice of Objection is received by
Purchaser, then the Closing Date Schedule (as revised in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_) shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier
of (i) the date Sellers and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Objection or (ii)
the date any matters properly in dispute are finally resolved in writing by
the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the
delivery of a Notice of Objection, Sellers and Purchaser shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
any matter specified in the Notice of Objection. At the end of such thirty
(30) day period, Sellers and Purchaser shall submit to the Accounting Firm for
review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which
remain in dispute and which were properly included in the Notice
of Objection. Purchaser and Sellers shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
review and resolve any and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in
dispute and which were properly included in the Notice of Objection. Purchaser
and Sellers shall instruct the Accounting Firm to make a final determination
of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Date
Schedule (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in the definition of Closing Net Working
Capital, Target Net Working Capital and Cash. Purchaser and Sellers will
cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement.
Purchaser and Sellers shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, or less
than the smallest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand,
or Sellers, on the other hand. Purchaser and Sellers shall also instruct the
Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely on presentations by
Purchaser and Sellers that are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement ( __ _i.e._ __, not on the basis of an
independent review). The Closing Date Schedule and the resulting Purchase
Price Adjustments shall become final and binding on the Parties hereto on the
date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to
Purchaser and Sellers (which final resolution shall be requested by the
Parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45) days following
submission of such disputed matters to the Accounting Firm) and shall not be
subject to judicial review (except in the case of manifest error or fraud).
All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section
2.4_ shall be borne by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the Closing Date Schedule and the resulting Purchase Price
Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers and Purchaser shall each
bear its own costs in presenting their respective cases to the Accounting
Firm. _ _

(c) _Payment of Working Capital Adjustment_. The following adjustment (the "
_Working Capital Adjustment_ ") shall be made to the Purchase Price based on
the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)_:

 



18 (i) If Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital (and such difference exceeds the Collar Amount), then Sellers shall
be entitled to receive an additional amount in cash from Purchaser equal to
the difference between Closing Net Working Capital and Target Net Working
Capital, but only to the extent and for the amount of such difference in
excess of the Collar Amount, which shall be paid to Sellers as set forth in
_Section 2.4(e)_.

(ii) If Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital (and such difference exceeds the Collar Amount), then Purchaser shall
be entitled to receive from Sellers an amount in cash equal to the difference
between Closing Net Working Capital and Target Net Working Capital, but only
to the extent and for the amount of such difference in excess of the Collar
Amount, which shall be paid to Purchaser as set forth in  _Section 2.4(e)_.

__(iii) For purposes hereof, any payment made pursuant to  _Section
2.4(c)(i)_, shall be referred to herein as a " _Positive Working Capital
Adjustment Amount_ " and any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_,
shall be referred to herein as a " _Negative Working Capital Adjustment
Amount_ ". __

(iv) In the event that the Negative Working Capital Adjustment Amount exceeds
the Working Capital Holdback Amount (taking into account any reduction thereof
relating to the Closing Date Cash Adjustment), Purchaser shall, at its option,
be entitled to (A) set off the amount of such Negative Working Capital
Adjustment Amount against the Indemnity Holdback Amount and/or (B) demand
payment of such Negative Working Capital Adjustment Amount from Sellers which
amount shall be paid by Sellers within the time periods specified in _Section
2.4(e)_.

(d) _Payment of Closing Date Cash Adjustment_. The following adjustment
(the " _Closing Date Cash Adjustment_ ") shall be made to the Purchase Price
based on the final determination of the Closing Date Cash and the Closing Date
Company Indebtedness pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_:

 

 __(i) If Closing Date Cash is greater than the Closing Date Company
Indebtedness (such difference being the " _Positive Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount_ "), then Sellers shall be entitled to receive an additional
amount in cash from Purchaser equal to the Positive Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount, which shall be paid to Sellers as set forth in _Section
2.4(e)_. __

__(ii) If Closing Date Cash is less than the Closing Date Company
Indebtedness (such difference being the " _Negative Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount_ "), then Purchaser shall be entitled to receive from
Sellers an amount in cash equal to the Negative Closing Date Cash
Adjustment Amount, which shall be paid as set forth in _Section 2.4(e)_. __

(iii) In the event that the Negative Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Working Capital Holdback Amount (taking into account any reduction
thereof relating to the Working Capital Adjustment), Purchaser shall, at its
option, be entitled to (A) set off the amount of such Negative Closing Date
Cash Adjustment Amount against the Indemnity Holdback Amount and/or (B) demand
payment of such Negative Closing Date Cash Adjustment Amount from Sellers
which amount shall be paid by Sellers within the time periods specified in
_Section 2.4(e)_.

 



19 (e) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. Any amounts owed by Sellers pursuant
to this  _Section 2.4_ shall be satisfied in the following manner: (i)
first, as a set off against the Working Capital Holdback Amount and (ii)
second, to the extent such amounts exceed the Working Capital Holdback Amount,
as a claim directly against Sellers, subject to _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_ and
_Section 2.4(d)(ii)_. Any obligations of Sellers under this _Section 2.4_
shall be the sole obligations of Tan. Payments pursuant to _Sections 2.4(c)_
 and _2.4(d)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account(s) designated by Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, as
follows: (i) if no Notice of Objection is delivered by Sellers, such amount(s)
shall be paid within fifteen (15) Business Days of the earlier of the
expiration of the sixty (60) day period for delivery of such Notice of
Objection and the date of delivery by Purchaser of a notice that the Closing
Date Schedule will be accepted without objection, or (ii) if a Notice of
Objection is delivered by Sellers, (A) any net undisputed amount due shall be
paid within fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of such Notice of
Objection, and (B) the remaining amount, if any, due shall be paid within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date all disputed items are finally
resolved pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_. Any amounts payable to Sellers under
this _Section 2.4_ shall be paid to Sellers in accordance with the
percentage allocations set forth in _Schedule 2.3(c)_ (as amended by Schedule
4 to the Escrow Agreement). Any amounts not paid when required pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(e)_ shall bear interest compounded annually from the
required date of payment to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of
interest as quoted in the " _Money Rates_ " column of _The Wall Street
Journal_ published as of the last day of each calendar month. If the Wall
Street Journal prime rate ceases to be made available by the publisher, or any
successor to the publisher of _The Wall Street Journal_ , the interest rate
will be determined by using a comparable index.

 

2.5 Holdback Provisions.

__

not (a) impair or delay the ability of such Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, or perform its obligations under, this Agreement
and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or (b) cause a
Material Adverse Change. If such Seller is a corporation or a limited

lapse of time or both would constitute a default) of any material Contract to
which such Seller is a party or by which such Seller or any of Sellers
material assets are bound;

 

(b) result in a violation of any Law or Order, in any material respect, to

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Company (i) has all requisite limited liability company power to own, operate
and lease its properties and carry on its business as the same is now being
conducted and (ii) is qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction set forth in _Schedule 4.1(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. Neither the location of its property nor the conduct of
its business requires the Company to be qualified to do business as a foreign
entity in any jurisdiction, other than those in which it is so qualified,
where the failure to so qualify would cause a Material Adverse Change.

(b) All actions, if any, on the part of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
equity holders of the Subsidiaries necessary for the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which
they are a party, and the performance of all of their obligations hereunder
and thereunder and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions have been
taken or will be taken prior to the Closing. The Company has full power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to
which it is a party. This Agreement (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by each other party hereto) constitutes, and upon execution and
delivery each other Transaction Agreement to which

 



23  the Company is a party (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by each other party hereto) will constitute, valid and legally binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors rights generally or (ii) as limited by laws relating to the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies.

(c) The Company has made available to Purchaser complete and correct copies
of the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the

4.2 Subsidiaries.

(a) (i) _Schedule 4.2(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with respect
to each Subsidiary: (A) its name and principal address; (B) its entity type;
(C) the jurisdiction of its organization and the jurisdictions, if any, in
which it is qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good
standing; (D) the names and addresses of each equity owner of record or Person
having any right to acquire any such equity interest from any such
Subsidiary, and the number and type of equity interests (or right to acquire
same from any such Subsidiary) owned of record by each such Person, and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers the names and addresses of each equity owner or
Person having any right to acquire any such equity interest (other than from
the Subsidiary), and the number and type of equity interests (or right to
acquire the same from a Person other than the Subsidiary) owned by
such Person; (E) the names of the members of its board of directors, general
partner, board of managers or similar governing body (including the persons
serving in such capacities with respect to any of the foregoing that is an
entity); and (F) the names of its executive officers. Each Subsidiary is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization applicable to its entity type. Each
Subsidiary has all requisite power to own, operate and lease its properties
and carry on its business as the same is now being conducted.

(ii) With respect to each Subsidiary, neither the location of its property
nor the conduct of its business requires such Subsidiary to be qualified to do
business as a foreign entity in any jurisdiction, other than those in which it
is so qualified as set forth on  _Schedule 4.2(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, where the failure to so qualify would cause a Material Adverse
Change. The Company does not control, directly or indirectly, or have any
direct or indirect equity participation or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other business association or entity which is not a Subsidiary. Other than as
identified on _Schedule 4.2(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owns or holds the right to acquire any shares of
stock or any other security or equity interest of or in any other Person. No
equity interest in any Subsidiary that is not a _sociedad an onima, _or a
subtype thereof, is or has ever been certificated.

(b) The Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects

46 ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Sellers that, except as set forth
in a Disclosure Schedule corresponding in number to the applicable Section of
this _ARTICLE V_ :

 

5.1 Organization and Good Standing. Purchaser is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, with the requisite power and authority to own and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted.
Purchaser is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and, to
the extent legally applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its owned, operated or leased properties or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not impair or delay
the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Contemplated Transactions by, or
perform its obligations under, this Agreement and each other Transaction
Agreement to which it is a party. 

5.2 Authority Relative to Agreement; Effect of Agreement. All action on the
part of Purchaser necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party,
and the performance of all of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have
been taken or will be taken prior to the date of this Agreement. Purchaser
has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and each other
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party. This Agreement (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party hereto)
constitutes, and upon execution and delivery of each other Transaction
Agreement to which Purchaser is a party (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by each other party thereto) will constitute, valid and legally
binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except (a) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other Laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors rights generally or (b) as limited by Laws relating to the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies.

5.3 Absence of Conflict. None of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which Purchaser is a
party, nor the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, will directly or
indirectly: 

(a) result in any violation or breach of any material Contract to which
Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or any of Purchasers material
assets are bound; or

(b) result in a violation of any Law or Order, in any material respect,
to which Purchaser or any of Purchasers material assets are subject.

5.4 Authorizations. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 5.4_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, no Authorization is required to be obtained or given by Purchaser in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and
each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

 



47 5.5 Litigation. There is no Order or Action which exists, is pending or, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
officers, directors, agents, employees or equity holders which questions the
validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken in connection
herewith or that would give any third party the right to enjoin or rescind
the Contemplated Transactions or otherwise prevent Purchaser from complying
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

5.6 No Brokers or Finders. Purchaser has no Liability to pay any Brokers
Obligations with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

 

5.7 Investment. Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Interests for its own
account for investment and not with a view to distribution within the meaning
of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Membership Interests. It has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its purchase of the Membership Interests. It confirms
that Sellers have made available to it and its representatives the opportunity
to ask questions of the officers and management of the Company and to
acquire such additional information about the operations and the financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

5.8 Restricted Securities. The Membership Interests being acquired by it are
characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws
inasmuch as such Membership Interests are being acquired in a transaction not
involving a public offering, and that under such Laws and applicable
regulations such securities may not be resold without registration under the
Securities Act unless an exemption from registration thereunder is available.
Purchaser represents that it is familiar with Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations
imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

prior to the Closing and (ii) any material failure of Purchaser of
which Purchaser becomes aware to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Purchaser
hereunder.

(b) Sellers shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of (i) any fact, event,

becomes aware to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by Sellers hereunder; and (iii) any fact,

6.7 Confidentiality. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that all
information provided to Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates or

(the " _NDA_ "), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by

its Subsidiaries (an " _Alternative Structure_ "). If Purchaser requests that
Sellers and the Company effect the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to an
Alternative Structure within twenty (20) days of the date hereof, Sellers and
the Company hereby agree to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
effect such Alternative Structure prior to Closing, including making such
amendments to the Transaction Agreements as are reasonably necessary to effect
such Alternative Structure, with any increased reasonable costs incurred by
the Sellers in connection with such Alternative Structure to be paid or
reimbursed by Purchaser.

Transactions pursuant to an Alternative Structure, Sellers may retain

Sellers for effecting the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to such
Alternative Structure as compared to a sale of all of the Membership
Interests of the Company, the results of which shall be provided to Sellers
and Purchaser within ten (10) days following the request by Purchaser to
Sellers. If the Contemplated Transactions are effected pursuant to such
Alternative Structure, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller
for any Taxes incurred by such Seller for effecting the Contemplated
Transactions pursuant to the Alternative Structure that are in excess of the
Taxes that such Seller would have incurred as a result of the sale of the
Membership Interests.

(c) If Purchaser does not request that Sellers and the Company effect the
Contemplated Transactions pursuant to an Alternative Structure, Purchaser may
request that Sellers cooperate with Purchaser (which cooperation shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to file any forms, reports or
other filings with any Taxing Authority that may facilitate Purchaser
effecting any post-Closing restructuring activities, all at Purchasers
reasonable cost and expense, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
Sellers harmless for any reasonable costs incurred in connection therewith or
any adverse tax impact on Sellers caused by such post-Closing restructuring.

allocation of responsibility for the preparation of Tax Returns before and
after the Closing Date and payment of Taxes as between Purchaser and Sellers
for certain Tax matters:

 

(i) Between the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare and file, or shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to
prepare and file, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by the Company and such Subsidiary (taking account of extensions) on or
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall file or cause to
be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary for all Tax
periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time that are required to be filed
(taking account of extensions) on or after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with past practices and applicable Law. In the event that
any such Tax Return requires Purchasers signature or the signature of any
employee or agent of the Company or Subsidiary, Purchaser shall sign or cause
such person to sign the Tax Return provided that Purchaser is provided with a
copy of each such Tax Return at least ten (10) Business Days prior to its due
date (taking into account extensions) together with sufficient information to
permit Purchaser to verify such Tax Return, and Sellers shall make such
changes to any such Tax Returns as Purchaser shall reasonably request prior to
its filing.

 



55 (iii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause
to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with past practices and applicable Law. Purchaser shall
provide Sellers with a copy of each such Tax Return at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to its filing together with sufficient information to permit
Sellers to verify the appropriate Tax treatment of all items on such Tax
Return, and shall make such changes (that relate to a deviation from past
practices or applicable Law) to any such Tax Returns as Sellers shall
reasonably request prior to its filing. Tan shall be liable, subject to
the limitations in this _Section 7.3_ and _ARTICLE X,_ for and shall pay to
Purchaser within five (5) days of notice Taxes which relate to the portion of
such tax period ending on the Closing Date.

 

(iv) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all other Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and each
Subsidiary.

(v) Tan shall, subject to the limitations in _Section 7.3_ and _ARTICLE X_ ,
pay or reimburse Purchaser for Taxes imposed upon the Company, each
Subsidiary, each Seller and their respective Affiliates with respect to all
Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
within five (5) Business Days of Sellers receipt of written notice from
Purchaser containing such information as is reasonably sufficient to permit
Sellers to confirm that such Taxes are due and owing and Sellers
responsibility therefor; _provided_ ,  _however_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Tan
shall not be liable for any such Taxes to the extent that such amount was
reflected as an Liability in the Closing Balance Sheet (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.4_).

(vi) Purchaser shall pay Sellers any amount representing a refund or
overpayment of any Taxes imposed upon the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to all Tax periods (or portions thereof) as to which Sellers are
liable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ within five (5) Business Days
of Purchasers receipt of such amount or, if earlier, at the time Purchaser
claims any reduction of Tax due from the Company or any Subsidiary relating to
such refund or overpayment; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be liable to Sellers with respect to any such refund or
overpayment of Taxes to the extent that such amount was reflected as an asset
in the Closing Balance Sheet (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_
).

(vii) For purposes of this _Section 7.3_, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes but
does not end at or prior to the Effective Time, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending at the Effective Time shall
(A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income,
gains or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period before the Effective Time and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (B) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income, gains or 

 



56  receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended at the Effective Time. Any Tax credits relating to a
Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken
into account as though the relevant Tax period ended at the Effective Time.

(c) _Tax Indemnification_.

(i) Subject to the limitations in this _Section 7.3_, Tan hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and against Liabilities of the
Company, any Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates for Taxes (including,
without limitation, withholding Taxes that apply to any interest paid, royalty
payments or rents that are required to be paid to a third party in any
country other than the payors country of formation) attributable to Tax
periods (or portions thereof) of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates ending at or before the Effective Time. Tan hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any
Liabilities of Sellers for Taxes attributable to any Tax period. In addition,
Tan agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any
Liabilities of the Company, any Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates
for Taxes allocable to Tax periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the
Effective Time that arise out of a Tax Contest for a Tax period ending at or
prior to the Effective Time that are attributable to a decrease in income or
a gain, or an increase in deduction, loss or credit for a Tax period ending at
or before the Effective Time in an amount not to exceed the amount of any
refund of Tax actually received and retained by Sellers as a result thereof.
Sellers indemnification obligations under this _Section 7.3(c)(i)_ are
referred to herein as the " _Tax Indemnity_ ". Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, any obligations of Sellers under _Section 7.3_ shall be
obligations of Tan.

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 7.3_ and the calculation of any indemnity
payable or amount recoverable under this Agreement, any interest, penalties or
additions to Tax accruing before or after the Effective Time with respect to a
Liability for Taxes for which Purchaser is entitled to recover from Sellers
shall be deemed to be attributable to a Tax period with respect to which
Sellers are required to indemnify Purchaser.

(d) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Sellers and Purchaser agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

(e) _Tax Contests_. Purchaser shall inform Sellers of the commencement of any
audit, investigation, examination or proceeding (" _Tax Contest_ ") relating
in whole or in part to Taxes for which Purchaser may be entitled to indemnity
from Sellers hereunder. With respect to any Tax Contest involving any Tax
period for which Sellers would be liable under this _Section 7.3_, Sellers
shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all proceedings taken in
connection with such Tax Contest with counsel or other professional advisors
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of Sellers intention to
control such Tax Contest, (ii) in the case of a Tax Contest relating to Taxes
of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates for a
Tax period beginning before and ending after the Effective Time, Sellers and
Purchaser shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any
such Tax Contest, and (iii) if any Tax Contest would reasonably be expected
to have a materially adverse effect on Purchaser, the Company, or any of

 



57  their Affiliates in any Tax period beginning after the Effective Time, the
Tax Contest shall not be settled or resolved without Purchasers consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice is given to Sellers of the
commencement of any Tax Contest and Sellers do not, within twenty (20)
Business Days after Purchasers notice is given, give written notice to
Purchaser of its election to assume the defense thereof, Sellers shall be
bound by any determination made in such Tax Contest or any compromise or
settlement thereof effected, in good faith, by Purchaser. The failure of
Purchaser to give reasonably prompt notice of any Tax Contest shall not
release, waive or otherwise affect Sellers obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that Sellers can demonstrate material loss and prejudice
as a result of such failure. Purchaser and the Company shall use their
reasonable efforts to provide Sellers with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested by Sellers in connection with a Tax Contest controlled
solely or jointly by Sellers.

 

(f) _Amended Returns, etc_.

(i) Except as required by Law or to the extent provided in _Sections 7.3(e)_
and _7.3(f)(ii)_ , without the prior written consent of Sellers (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), none of
Purchaser, the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall
file any amended Tax Return with respect to any Tax period ending on or before
the Effective Time, unless Purchaser, Company and any such Subsidiary or
Affiliate agree to indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against any
potential adverse Tax effect relating thereto and release Sellers from any
claim under this _Section 7.3_ and _ARTICLE X_ arising therefrom. 

(ii) To the extent permitted by Law, each of Purchaser, the Company and the
Subsidiaries may carry back, or cause or permit the Company and the
Subsidiaries to carry back, for federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax purposes
to any taxable year or period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the
Effective Time any operating losses, net operating losses, capital
losses, Tax credits or similar items arising in a taxable period (or portion
thereof) occurring on or after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
Sellers would be materially adversely affected by such carryback. To the
extent that any Liability for which, but for such carryback, Sellers would be
liable under _Section 7.3(b)(vii)_ is thereby reduced or extinguished, Tan
covenants to pay to Purchaser, the Company or the relevant Affiliate an amount
equivalent to the Liability that would otherwise have arisen under _Section
7.3(b)(vii)_. Any refunds of Taxes resulting from such carrybacks shall be for
the benefit of Purchaser and the Company and the Subsidiaries, and Sellers
shall have no entitlement thereto. 

(g) _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. All real property transfer taxes, other
transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and similar Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
purchase of the Membership Interests (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
shall be paid by Purchaser. 

(h) _Payments_. Purchaser may by written notice to Sellers make a claim for
indemnification or recovery under this  _Section 7.3_ which shall include a
calculation of the amount of the requested indemnity or recovery payment and
such additional information as may be reasonably sufficient to permit Sellers
to verify such claim. Within ten (10) Business Days after the indemnity or
recovery calculation has been provided, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the
recovery or indemnification amount determined to be due.

 



58 (i) _Access and Assistance_. Following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall and
shall cause the Company and each of the Subsidiaries to give Sellers and
their authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the books
and records of the Company to the extent relating to periods prior to or
including the Effective Time as Sellers may reasonably request for purposes of
preparing Tax Returns and conducting proceedings relating to Taxes. Purchaser,
the Company, each of the Subsidiaries, Sellers and their Affiliates will
provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any
of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or
other examination by any Taxing Authority, any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to Liability for Taxes, or any other matter relating to
Taxes and arising under this _Section 7.3_, and each will retain and provide
the others with any records or information that may be relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or claim. Such assistance shall
include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns and supporting work
schedules and other records and information which assistance shall be provided
without charge except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Purchaser will or will cause the Company and each of the Subsidiaries to
retain, until all appropriate statutes of limitation (including any
extensions) expire, copies of all Tax Returns of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, supporting work schedules and other records or information
which may be relevant to such Tax Returns, and will not destroy or otherwise
dispose of such materials without first providing Sellers with a reasonable
opportunity to review and copy such materials.

 

(j) _Treatment of Purchase_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Parties
agree to treat the purchase of the Membership Interests by Purchaser as a
purchase by Purchaser of all of the Companys assets, as provided in Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 Situation #2. Sellers have been given the
opportunity to consult with their own Tax advisors with respect to the Tax
consequences of the Contemplated Transactions.

7.4 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

 

(a) Tanus, for himself and his Affiliates and Family Members, hereby agrees
for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, and each Seller,
hereby agrees for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, not to
directly or indirectly:

(i) engage or invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control, or
participate in the ownership, management operation, financing, or control of,
be employed by, associated with, or in any manner connected with, lend such
Sellers name or any similar name to, lend their credit to or render services,
assistance or advice to, any Competing Business anywhere in North America;
provided, however, that Tanus and his Affiliates and Family Members, and each
such Seller may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than) five
percent of any class of equity securities (including securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such equity securities) of any Competing
Business (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such
Competing Business) if such equity securities (including securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such equity securities) are listed on any
national or registered security exchange or have been registered under
Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

 



59 (ii) whether for Tanus, his Affiliates or Family Members or for such Sellers
own account or for the account of any other Person, solicit Competing
Business from any Person known by any Seller to be a customer of the Company
or any Subsidiary, whether or not Tanus, his Affiliates or Family Members, or
such Seller had personal contact with such Person during and by reason of
Tanus, his Affiliates or Family Members or such Sellers employment or
ownership of the Company;

(iii) whether for Tanus, his Affiliates or Family Members or for such Sellers
own account or the account of any other Person (A) solicit, any person who is
an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (except any individual
identified on _Schedule 7.4(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) or in any
manner induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary (except any individual identified on _Schedule 7.4(a)(iii)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule) to terminate his employment with the Company or any such
Subsidiary; or (B) interfere with the Companys or its Subsidiaries
relationship with any Person; or

 

(iv) publicly disparage the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, or agents.

(b) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this  _Section 7.4_ was not performed in
accordance with its specified terms or was otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to the determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction, Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this _Section 7.4_ and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions herein in any court of competent
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity (without any requirement to post bond).

(c) Tanus and each Seller acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 7.4_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The covenants contained in this _Section 7.4_ and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction. If, at the time of enforcement of this
_Section 7.4_, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then
existing, Tanus and each Seller agree that the maximum period, scope or
geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for
the stated period, scope or area.

7.5 Confidential Information. As a further inducement for Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement, Tanus and each Seller agree that for three (3) years
after the Closing Date, Tanus or such Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, hold in strictest confidence, and not, without

 



60  the prior written approval of Purchaser, use for its own benefit or the
benefit of any Person other than the Company, the Subsidiaries or Purchaser or
disclose to any Person other than Purchaser (other than as required by Law)
any Confidential Information (as such term is defined in the NDA) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Affiliates and Family Members, and each Seller, and each of their respective

Releasor is a party or (iii) any obligations for payment of amounts accrued
on the Companys Interim Financial Statements but not paid to any such
Releasor prior to the Closing Date. In compliance with any Law which requires

expressly waives and relinquishes any and all such claims, rights or benefits

67 10.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants; Limitations.

 

(a) _Time Limitations and Extensions_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of Sellers (or any Seller) and Purchaser contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.4_ or
_Section 9.4_ hereof shall survive the Closing until the date that is

other agreement of Purchaser and Sellers hereunder shall survive in accordance
with its terms. No Party shall have any Liability for any claim for
indemnification under _ARTICLE X_ unless a Claim Notice is delivered by the
Person seeking indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is
sought prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, in which
case the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject
of such claim shall survive, to the extent of the claims described in such
Claim Notice only, until such claim is resolved, whether or not the amount of
the Damages resulting from such breach has been finally determined at the
time the Claim Notice is given.

(b) _Basket_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Tan shall not be liable to Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under _Section 10.1_ unless and until the aggregate Damages
which may be recovered from Tan exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in
which case Tan shall be liable for only the aggregate amount of Damages in
excess of the Basket. The limitation in this _Section 10.3(b)_ shall not
apply to Damages relating to or arising out of any breach of the Fundamental
Representations or intentional or fraudulent misrepresentations (" _Fraud
Claims_ ").

__(c) _Cap_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages which may be
recovered for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_,
as applicable, shall be $30,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); ___provided, that_ __,
(i) for Damages incurred in connection with or arising from any breach of
the Fundamental Representations, the Cap shall be the Purchase Price, and (ii)
if the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages exceeds $30,000,000 as a
result of any breach of any representation or warranty in  _Section 4.16_
(Taxes) or _Section 4.23_ (Environmental Compliance) or any covenant in
_Section 7.3_ (Tax Matters) (the " _Tax and Environmental Claims_ " _)_ , the
Cap shall be increased to $45,000,000, but only to the extent of such Damages
arising from such Tax and Environmental Claims. The limitation in this
_Section 10.3(c)_ shall not apply to Damages relating to or arising out of
any breach of a post-Closing covenant in this Agreement (other than _Section
7.3_ or _Section 7.8_) or intentional or fraudulent misrepresentations. __

 



68 (d) _Knowledge_. The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other
remedy based on any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations set forth herein and in the Transaction Agreements will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on
such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

(e) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages to the extent that such Damages were included
within the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

10.4 Procedures with Respect to Claims.

(a) _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a
Seller Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to seek
indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE X_ , with respect to any matter
not covered by _Section 10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall, provide the
other Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") a notice in writing (a " _Claim Notice_ ") specifying
in reasonable detail the basis of such claim and the claimed amount of such
Damages, to the extent then known (the " _Claimed Amount_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that failure to give such Claim Notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except and only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Indemnified Party shall thereupon give the
Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the books, records and assets of the
Indemnified Party which evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or
occurrence giving rise to such Claim Notice. Within twenty (20) days after
delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a response (the " _Response_ ") in which the Indemnifying
Party shall either:

 

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or
by wire transfer;

(ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive some other
amount mutually agreed between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party (the " _Agreed Amount_ "), in which case the Response shall be
accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer; or

(iii) in good faith dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
any of the Claimed Amount, specifying in reasonable detail the grounds for
such dispute and the amount of Damages for which the Indemnifying Party
believes it should be responsible (a  _"Dispute_ " __). During the thirty
(30) day period following the delivery of a Response that

 



69  reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If such Dispute is not resolved
during such thirty (30) day period, such Dispute shall be resolved in a state
or federal court, in accordance with _Sections 11.10_ and _11.11_.

In the event that an Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Response within
twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have agreed that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive all of the Claimed Amount. 

(b) _Procedures with Respect to Third-Party Claims_.

 

(i) In the event an Indemnified Party is made a party to a Third Party Claim
arising out of a matter for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , such Indemnified Party shall,
within twenty (20) days after receiving actual notice of such Third Party
Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party
Claim (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such Third Party Claim); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give or any delay in such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except and only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure or delay. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. As used
herein, " _Third Party Claim_ " means an Action which is asserted or
threatened by a party other than the Parties hereto, their successors and
permitted assigns against an Indemnified Party.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (provided such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to each Indemnified Party and which shall be deemed
acceptable if each such Indemnified Party does not otherwise notify the
Indemnifying Party within ten (10) days after having been notified in writing
of the identity thereof) by providing written notice to the Indemnified Party
within twenty (20) days after receiving written notice of the Third Party
Claim from the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)(i)_; _provided_
, _that_ if the Indemnifying Party is any Seller, such Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume or direct the defense of any such Third
Party Claim that (A) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is
a supplier or customer of the Company, or (B) seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate and reasonably consult and advise in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ , that if the named
parties to such action, suit, proceeding or claim include both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised
in writing by its counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled, at the Indemnifying Partys expense (subject to the limitations set
forth in this _ARTICLE X_ ), to separate counsel of its own choosing.
Regardless of the party controlling the defense or prosecution of a
Third Party Claim (such controlling party being, the " _Controlling Party_
"), all Indemnifying and Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof. Such reasonable cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the non-Controlling Partys request) the

 



70  provision to the Controlling Party of records and information in the
Controlling Partys possession that are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making the Controlling Parties respective agents and
representatives available on a reasonable and mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Provided that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any Liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). No Indemnifying Party shall, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement,
compromise or discharge of any Third Party Claim in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is named, unless such settlement, compromise or discharge,
as the case may be, (x) includes an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, from all Liability on claims that are the subject matter
of such Third Party Claim, (y) does not include any statement as to an
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party and (z) does not impose any continuing material obligation
or restrictions on any Indemnified Party.

10.5 Calculation and Mitigation of Damages. The amount of any Damages for
which indemnification is provided under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under insurance policies
or other collateral sources with respect to such Damages (net of
any deductible incurred in obtaining such proceeds). If the amount to be
netted hereunder in connection with a collateral source from any payment
required under _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ is received after payment by
the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such receipt, any amount that
the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_
had such receipt occurred at the time of such payment.

 

10.6 Indemnity Holdback Amount. Any amounts owed by any Seller to a Purchaser
Indemnified Party for Damages after the Closing Date shall be satisfied in
the following manner: (a) first, as a set off against the Indemnity Holdback
Amount and (b) second, to the extent such amounts exceed the then current
balance of the Indemnity Holdback Amount, as a claim directly against such
Seller.

10.7 Exclusive Remedy. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge, on their behalf and
on behalf of the other Seller Indemnified Parties and the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE X_ and _Section 7.3_
(other than related to Fraud Claims); _provided, however_ , that this shall
not affect the right of any party to seek or obtain specific performance or
other equitable remedies where there is no adequate remedy at Law, subject to
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.

10.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payment
made pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ of this Agreement shall be an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes. Unless otherwise required by Law, no Party shall take any position
inconsistent with the foregoing for any U.S. federal or applicable state or
local income Tax purposes.

 



71 ARTICLE XI

11.1 Termination.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(i) by Purchaser upon 5 days, or such lesser number of days prior to the
Closing Date, notice following a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of any Seller or Tanus set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of any Seller shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in  _ARTICLE
VIII_ would not be satisfied, and Sellers, any Seller, Tanus or the Company
are unable to cure such deficiency within such five (5) day, or less number of
days, period; _provided_ , _that_ Purchaser shall not be able to exercise
this termination right if, at the time of such notice or at any time in the
notice and cure period triggered by it, Purchaser is in breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such
breach individually or in combination with any other such breach, would cause
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ not to be satisfied;

 

(ii) by Tan upon 5 days, or such lesser number of days prior to the Closing
Date, notice following a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or failure to satisfy any condition on the part of Purchaser set

_ARTICLE IX_ would not be satisfied, and Purchaser is unable to cure such
deficiency within such five (5) day, or less number of days, period;
_provided_ , _that_ Tan shall not be able to exercise this termination right
if, at the time of such notice or at any time in the notice and cure period
triggered by Tans notice, Sellers, any Seller or Tanus is in breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such
breach individually or in combination with any other such breach, would cause
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ not to be satisfied;

 

(iii) by Tan or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred by August 30,
2013; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement

to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date;

(iv) by either Tan or Purchaser in the event that any Governmental Body shall
have issued any Order or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or

action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 

(v) by the mutual written consent of the Parties.

(b) If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.2_,
all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without
any Liability of any Party to any other Party (except in the event of a
termination pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ or 11.2(a)(ii) above, for any
Liability of any Party then in breach); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
provisions contained in _Sections_   _6.7_ , _7.5_ and _11.2(b)_ shall
survive termination indefinitely.

 



72 11.2 Publicity; Confidentiality.

 

(a) No press release or other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements or any of the Contemplated
Transactions may be made by a Party unless and until the text of the
announcement and the time and manner of its release have been approved by the
other Parties. Sellers and Purchaser will consult with each other concerning
the means by which the Companys employees, customers, suppliers and others
having dealings with the Company will be informed of the Contemplated
Transactions, and Sellers will have the right to be present for any such
communication. If a Party is bound by Law to make a press release or other
public announcement, such Party may do so, notwithstanding the failure of the
other Party to approve same, provided:

(i) the other Party is given at least three (3) Business Days prior written
notice of the intention to make such announcement and has a reasonable
opportunity to comment on the announcement; and

(ii) the announcement merely relates the facts and then only to the extent
necessary to satisfy the specific legal requirement.

(b) Subject to _Section 11.2(a)_, the terms of this Agreement shall remain
strictly confidential. Each Party hereto individually covenants not to
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement, whether generally or
specifically, to any third party, except as may be required by a Partys
attorneys, accountants or insurers, or by Order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that all
information provided by one Party to another is subject to the terms of the
NDA, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference and which shall
remain in effect following Closing.

11.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure Schedule,
the other Transaction Agreements and the NDA constitute the entire agreement
between the Parties hereto with respect to the Contemplated Transactions and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

11.4 Notices. All demands, notices, requests, consents and
other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be personally delivered or sent by facsimile machine or

faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
