OF MERGER, dated as of January 9, 2005 (the "Agreement"), among ALLTEL
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Wigeon Acquisition LLC, a
Washington limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Western Wireless Corporation, a Washington
corporation (the "Company").   WITNESSETH :   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, and the manager of Merger Sub,
have approved the acquisition of the Company by Merger Sub upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, and the manager of
Merger Sub, have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA") and the Washington
Limited Liability Company Act ("WLLCA");   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors
of the Company has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in
the Company\'s articles of incorporation and the WBCA applicable to a
"significant business transaction" (as defined in Section 23B.19 of the WBCA)
will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement (as defined below), or to the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;   WHEREAS, for
United States federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is
hereby adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the
Code; and   WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as
an inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement and
incurring the obligations set forth herein, certain of the Company\'s
shareholders, who beneficially or of record hold an aggregate of
approximately 41.2% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company, have entered with Parent into a Voting Agreement, dated
as of the date hereof, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to vote
their shares of capital stock of the Company over which such shareholders of
the Company have voting power to approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the WBCA and the WLLCA, the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3).

Company") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of
the Company in accordance with the WBCA and the WLLCA.   Section 1.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date") which
shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law (as defined in Section
3.7(a)) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that are
to be satisfied by action at the Closing) at a location specified in writing
by Parent.   Section 1.3 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the parties
shall execute and file in the office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Washington the articles of merger in accordance with the plan of merger,
in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the WBCA and the WLLCA (the "Articles of Merger"), and shall
make all other filings or recordings, if any, required under the WBCA and the
WLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of the
Articles of Merger, or at such later time as is agreed upon by the parties
hereto and set forth therein (such time as the Merger becomes effective is
referred to herein as the "Effective Time").   Section 1.4 Effects of the
Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the WBCA and the WLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Company.   Section 1.5 Certificate of Formation
and Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Company.   (a)
Subject to Section 5.12 of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the
certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the
WLLCA or therein, except that as of the Effective Time, Paragraph 1 of the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Company shall be amended to reflect
the name of the Company (or a variation thereof) as the name of the Surviving
Company.   (b) Subject to Section 5.12 of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company,   5  until
thereafter changed or amended as provided by the WLLCA, the certificate
of formation of the Surviving Company and such limited liability company
agreement.   Section 1.6 Manager. The manager of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial manager of the Surviving
Company, to hold office in accordance with the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company.   Section 1.7 Officers. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial
officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company.   ARTICLE
II   CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1 Effect
on Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
securities of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a) Conversion of Company Common
Stock. Subject to Section 2.1(d) and 2.1(e), each issued and outstanding
share of Class A Common Stock, no par value per share ("Class A Common
Stock"), and each issued and outstanding share of Class B Common Stock, no
par value per share ("Class B Common Stock"), in each case, of the Company
(together, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, "Company Common
Stock" or "Shares") (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided in, Section 2.1(e)) shall thereupon be converted into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration
(the "Merger Consideration"):   (i) Each share of Company Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a
"Mixed Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant
to Section 2.2 (each, a "Mixed Consideration Electing Share") and each Non-
Electing Company Share (as that term is defined in Section 2.2(c) hereof)
shall be converted into the right to receive the combination (which
combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Mixed Consideration") of
(x) $9.25 in cash (the "Per Share Cash Amount") and (y) 0.535 of a share of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.1(d).   (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "Cash Election") has
been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each,
a "Cash Electing Company Share") shall be converted (provided that the
Available Cash Election Amount (as defined below) equals or exceeds the Cash
Election Amount (as defined below)) into the right to receive $40.00 in cash
without interest (the "Per Share Cash Election Consideration"); if, however,
(A) the product of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the "Cash Election
Amount") exceeds (B) the     6  difference between (x) the product of
Per Share Cash Amount and the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than the Cancelled Shares, as such term is defined in Section 2.1(b)
hereof) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus
(y) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Shares and the
Per Share Cash Amount (such difference being the "Available Cash Election
Amount"), then each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into a
right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the
product of (p) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (q) a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction
being the "Cash Fraction") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (r)
the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.   (iii) Each
share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive
stock consideration (a "Stock Election") is properly made and not revoked or
lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each, a "Stock Electing Company Share") shall
be converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the
Available Cash Election Amount), into the right to receive 0.7 shares of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.1(d) (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(e), the "Stock
Consideration"), however, if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the
Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Electing Company Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest)
equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Stock Electing
Company Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1)
of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration.   (b) Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Cancelled Shares") shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Merger Sub Interests.
Each issued and outstanding limited liability company interest of Merger Sub
shall be converted into one validly issued limited liability company interest
of the Surviving Company.   (d) Adjustments. (i) If at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Mixed
Election Stock Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted;
provided,     7  however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to permit any action that Parent is otherwise prohibited from taking pursuant
to this Agreement.   (ii) The matters contained in Schedule 2.1(d)(ii)
are incorporated here.   (e) Dissenting Shares. (i) Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary other than Section 2.1(e)(ii),
any Shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 23B.13 of the WBCA and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters\' rights ("Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), but instead shall be converted into
the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the WBCA. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a member or equity owner
of the Surviving Company or of a shareholder of Parent. For purposes of the
calculations in Section 2.1(a), all Non-Electing Company Shares and shares of
Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration
Electing Shares.   (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(a),
if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands dissenters\'
rights of such shares under the WBCA shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holder\'s shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive Merger
Consideration payable or issuable in respect of Mixed Consideration Electing
Shares as set forth in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, without any interest
thereon.   (iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of
any written demands for dissenters\' rights of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to the WBCA and received by the Company which relate to any such demand for
dissenters\' rights and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time
with respect to demands for dissenters\' rights under the WBCA. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for dissenters\' rights of Company Common Stock
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   Section 2.2 Company
Election Procedures.   (a) Not less than three Business Days prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"), which
Exchange Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the purpose
of exchanging certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Company Book-Entry
Shares").    8   (b) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date
(as defined below), is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock
other than Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to specify the number of such
holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock (and, if such shares to which the
election relates are represented by Certificates, such particular shares)
with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, Stock Election or
Mixed Election.   (c) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement a form of election (the "Form of Election") in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
any Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election
and any Certificates. The Company shall mail the Form of Election with the
Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.12) to all persons who are record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the
Company Meeting (as defined in Section 5.5(d)). The Form of Election shall be
used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case
of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions
and documentation) to make a valid and timely Cash Election, a Stock Election
or a Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails to make a valid and
timely Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election with respect to
any shares of Company Common Stock held or beneficially owned by such holder,
then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect
to those shares (each such share, a "Non-Electing Company Share"). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election
available to all persons who become holders of shares of Company Common Stock
during the period between the record date for the Company Meeting and
the Election Date.   (d) Any holder\'s election shall have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office,
by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified on the Form of
Election as agreed upon by the parties, or if no such date is specified, on
the later of (1) the date of the Company Meeting or (2) if the Closing Date
is more than four Business Days following the Company Meeting, two Business
Days preceding the Closing Date (the "Election Date"), a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of
Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for
transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a
firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"));
provided that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent
by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of
Company Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents required by
the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares
shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until
such Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election is properly revoked.  
(e) Parent and Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Date
at least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the
Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall
be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and     9  Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Date.   (f) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed
Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the
applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition,
all Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically
be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII. If
a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, Certificates representing
such shares shall be promptly returned to the holder that submitted the same
to the Exchange Agent.   (g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the
joint determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and
binding as to whether or not Mixed Elections, Cash Elections and Stock
Elections shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section
2.2 and as to when Mixed Elections, Cash Elections, Stock Elections and
revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or
Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines
to make the following computation) shall also make all computations
contemplated by Section 2.1(a), and absent manifest error this computation
shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written
agreement of Parent, after Parent\'s reasonable consultation with the
Company, make any rules as are consistent with this Section 2.2 for
the implementation of the Mixed Elections, Cash Elections, Stock Elections
provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect
these Mixed Elections, Cash Elections and Stock Elections.   Section 2.3
Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Deposit of Merger Consideration. (i) At or
prior to Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the shareholders of the Company, (A) certificates or, at
Parent\'s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing shares
of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Certificates") in denominations as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (B) cash, in each case as are
issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article II in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock for which Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent or the cash to be
paid in lieu of fractional shares. Such Parent Certificates (or evidence of
book-entry form, as the case may be) and such cash so deposited, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund".   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration, pursuant to Section 2.1 (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify),    
10  and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. (x) Each former
shareholder of the Company who properly made and did not revoke a Cash
Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for such shareholder\'s Cash Electing Company Shares, Stock Electing
Company Shares or Mixed Consideration Electing Shares, as the case may be;
and (y) each holder of Non-Electing Company Shares, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
representing such Non-Electing Company Shares together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Exchange Agent, shall be able to exchange therefor, the following  
(i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which
such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder\'s
properly surrendered Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock to which an election
or non-election of the same type were made), and such Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and   (ii) a
check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant this Section 2.3(b)) equal to (I) the amount of cash
(including the Per Share Cash Election Consideration or the Per Share Cash
Election Amount, as applicable and cash in lieu of fractional interests
in shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3(e)), if
any, into which such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article II,
plus (II) any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(c); provided, however, that the
holders of such Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall be permitted to specifically elect on such letter of transmittal those
shares of stock that are to be Mixed Consideration Electing Shares, Cash
Electing Company Shares, and/or Stock Electing Company Shares, at such
holder\'s option. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
Parent Certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-income Taxes (as
defined in Section 3.15(k)) required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock
such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to withhold or
deduct under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company     11  Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II and cash, if any, in lieu of any
fractional share in accordance with Section 2.3(e). No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates under the
provisions of this Article II.   (c) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time, or
that are payable to the holders of record thereof who become such on or after
the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share until those Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. All such
dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock which are to be paid in respect of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received upon surrender of the Certificate shall be paid
by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws
and Laws with respect to the withholding of Taxes, following surrender of any
such Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent
Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash for the purpose of satisfying
its obligations under clause (i) above.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock. The transfer of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
upon the surrender for the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms of this Article II (including distributions and dividends paid
pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.3(e)) shall be deemed payment in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving
Company\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized
or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise
provided by Law.   (e) No Fractional Shares.    12   (i) No Parent
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests,
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (ii) As promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall pay to
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of each holder of Company Common Stock,
an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price for a share of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (as reported
in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other
authoritative source) on the day of the Effective Time. The Surviving Company
shall pay any commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction
costs in connection with the sale, if any, of any Parent Common Stock in
connection with this Section 2.3(e).   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (g) Closing of Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.1(e).  
(h) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to such
date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash payable to the holder of
such Certificate pursuant to this Article II or any dividends or
distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Company, and any holders of the Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.     13   (i)
Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (j) Lost
Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and, if applicable,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions
on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in accordance with this Article
II in respect thereof.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
THE COMPANY   Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or in
the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and signed by
an authorized officer of the Company (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   Section 3.1 Qualification,

in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) on the Company. As used in
this Agreement, any reference to any state of facts, event, change or effect
having a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, means such state of facts, event, change or
effect that has had a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, but
shall not include facts, events, changes, effects or developments (i)
(A) generally affecting the rural, regional or nationwide wireless voice and
data industry in the United States or in other countries in which the Company
or its Subsidiaries conduct business, including regulatory and political
developments, or (B) generally affecting the economy or financial markets in

duly qualified or licensed to do business and, if applicable, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the

Violation.   (a) The Company has requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the

the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Company and, except for the (i) Company
Shareholder Approval and (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of Washington, no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to authorize the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company has
taken all necessary action so that Section 23B.19 of the WBCA will be
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Board of Directors of the Company has
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to
and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders and to recommend
to such shareholders that they approve and adopt this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally or by principles governing the availability
of equitable remedies).   (b) Other than in connection with or in

approval of, or filing with, any United States or foreign governmental or
regulatory agency, commission, court, body, entity or authority (each a
"Governmental Entity") is necessary for the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such
authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or significantly impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   (c) The
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not (i) result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse    17  of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness
or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement,
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding

violation, conflict, default, right, loss or Lien that has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.4 Reports and Financial
Statements.   (a) The Company has filed all forms, documents and reports
required to be filed prior to the date hereof by it with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since December 31, 2002 (the "Company SEC
Documents"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects, and all documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (the "Subsequent
Company SEC Documents") will comply in all material respects, with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of
the Company SEC Documents contained, and the Subsequent Company SEC Documents
will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will
omit, to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, or are to be made, not misleading.   (b) The consolidated
financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present in all material
respects, and included in the Subsequent Company SEC Documents will fairly
present in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other
adjustments described therein including the notes thereto) in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in
the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2002,
the Company has not made any change in the accounting practices or policies
applied in the preparation of its financial statements, except as required by
GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.   Section 3.5 Internal Controls
and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under
the    18  Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act. The Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations;
(b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general
or specific authorization; and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete and accurate copies of notices received from its independent
auditor prior to the date hereof of any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting since
December 31, 2003 and any other management letter or similar correspondence
from any independent auditor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
received since December 31, 2002 and prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, the Company is implementing such programs and is taking such steps as
it believes are necessary to effect compliance (not later than the relevant
statutory and regulatory deadline therefor) with all provisions of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that will become applicable to the Company and
has not received, orally or in writing, any notification that its independent
auditor (i) believes that the Company will not be able to complete its
assessment before the reporting deadline, or, if completed, that it will
not be completed in sufficient time for the independent auditor to complete
its assessment or (ii) will not be able to issue unqualified attestation
reports with respect thereto.   Section 3.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities.
Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the Company\'s consolidated
balance sheets (or the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents,
(ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2003, (iii)
liabilities or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in the
ordinary course of business and (iv) liabilities and obligations arising
after December 31, 2003, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any Company Minority Interest Business, has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto).  
Section 3.7 No Violation of Law; Permits.   (a) The Company and each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in default under
or in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration
award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "Laws"), applicable to    19  the Company, such
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, including,
without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and except as would not reasonably be expected to
significantly impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 3.7(a), no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section 3.7(a)
in respect of the matters referenced in Section 3.5, or in respect of
environmental, tax, employee benefits, labor or communications Laws matters,
which are the subject of the representations and warranties made in Sections
3.5, 3.8, 3.9, 3.15, 3.16, 3.21 and 3.22 of this Agreement.   (b) The
Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and except as would not reasonably be expected
to significantly impair or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and except as would not reasonably be expected
to significantly impair or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 3.8 Environmental Laws and Regulations.  
(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Laws relating to pollution or protection of human health or
the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water,
ground water, land surface or subsurface strata) (collectively,
"Environmental Laws"), which compliance includes, but is not limited to, the
possession by the Company and its Subsidiaries of all Company Permits that
are required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the
terms and conditions thereof, except for such non-compliance or failure to
possess such Company Permits as has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company; and (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of, or, is the subject of, any actions, causes of
action, claims, investigations, demands or notices by any person asserting an
obligation on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct
investigations or clean-up activities under Environmental Law or alleging
liability under or non-compliance with any Environmental Law (collectively,
"Environmental Claims") which would reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
As used herein "knowledge" of any person means the actual knowledge of the
executive officers of such person.   Section 3.9 Employee Benefit
Plan.    20   (a) Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
all material Company Benefit Plans. "Company Benefit Plans" means all
employee benefit plans, compensation arrangements and other benefit
arrangements, whether or not "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), whether or not subject to ERISA), providing cash- or
equity-based incentives, health, medical, dental, disability, accident or
life insurance benefits or vacation, severance, retirement, pension or

compensation, vacation, severance or other benefits to any officer, employee,
consultant or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except to
the extent providing benefits imposed or implied by applicable foreign
Law.   (b) Any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of the Company, continues
to satisfy the requirements for such qualification, except where the failure
to so qualify has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliates of the Company maintains or
contributes to any benefit plan covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or has engaged in any
transaction which is reasonably likely to result in any liability or penalty
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each Company Benefit Plan has been
maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and with ERISA and
the Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such non-compliance
which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any plan or
arrangement which, and no Company Benefit Plan provides, or has any liability
to provide, life insurance or medical or other employee welfare benefits to
any employee or former employee following his retirement or termination of
employment, except as required by applicable Law. The Company has not amended
the Company Benefit Plans in any manner whatsoever that would increase
materially the expense to the Company or its Subsidiaries of maintaining the
Company Benefit Plans above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof
for the year ended December 31, 2003. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
another event (A) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or
officer of the Company or any its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or as required by applicable Law, or (B) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee, consultant or officer, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, and no amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans will fail
to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of
the Code (assuming no acceleration of any options set forth on Section 3.2(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule).    21   (c) No Company Benefit Plan
is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
or a "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413 of the
Code. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies the requirements of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code, except where failure to satisfy such requirements has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (d) With respect to
each Company Benefit Plan that is not subject to United States law (a
"Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) all employer and employee contributions to each
Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit
Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with GAAP,
except for such contributions or accruals, the failure of which to make or
accrue has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;
(ii) as of the Closing Date, the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established
for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, will
be sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as
of the Closing Date, with respect to all current and former participants in
such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and
no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, except, in
each case, for insufficiencies or transactions that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company; and (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered
has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities, except for such failures to register or maintain as
have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (e) For
purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means any business or entity
which is a member of the same "controlled group of corporations," under
"common control" or an "affiliated service group" with an entity within the
meanings of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code, or required to be
aggregated with the entity under Section 414(o) of the Code, or is under

on the Company.   Section 3.11 Investigations; Litigation. Except as
described in the Company SEC Documents:    22   (a) there is no
investigation or review pending (or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened) by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company, any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the
Company Minority Interest Businesses, which would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; and   (b) there are no actions, suits, inquiries, investigations
or proceedings pending (or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened)
against or affecting the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or, to
the knowledge of the Company, any of the Company Minority Interest
Businesses, or any of their respective properties at law or in equity before,
and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of or before any Governmental
Entity, in each case, which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   Section 3.12 Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Other
Information. None of the information with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement (as defined below) or the
Registration Statement (as defined in Section 5.5(a)(i)) will, in the case of

time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements
thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, or, in the case of the
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The letters to shareholders, notices of meeting, proxy statement

therewith are collectively referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement."

accordance with GAAP in the most recent financial statements contained in
the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement.   (c)
There is no audit, examination, deficiency, refund litigation or proposed

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, as of the date
hereof, no power of attorney granted by either the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any material Taxes is currently in force.

required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material
item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion

agreement" described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed on or

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (h) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable
information reporting and Tax withholding requirements under federal, state
and local Tax laws, except for such failures to comply which do not have, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

Adverse Effect on the Company, or (ii) any pending regulatory proceeding
(other than those affecting the wireless industry generally) or judicial
review before a Governmental Entity, unless such pending regulatory
proceedings or judicial review would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries have

Company License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that
such Company License is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.    27   (c) The licensee of each Company License is in

contributions has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.   (d) Except as provided in the Company License Schedule,

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (f) The Company or a

licenses constitute all material authorizations necessary from the TKK, the
RTR-GmbH and ComReg for the business    28  operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as they are currently being conducted in Austria and
Ireland, except those authorizations the absence of which has not had, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, the
Company holds all licenses and authorizations necessary for the business
operations of the Company in Bolivia, Georgia and Haiti, except
those licenses and authorizations the failure to hold which has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Austrian and Irish Company
Licenses, together with the material licenses and authorizations in Bolivia,
Georgia and Haiti are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Foreign
Company Licenses."   (b) Each Foreign Company License is valid and in full
force and effect and has not been suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely
modified, except where the failure to be in full force and effect, or the

licenses has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
No Foreign Company License is subject to (i) any conditions or requirements
that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same service,
unless such conditions or requirements would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, or (ii) any pending regulatory proceeding (other than those
affecting the wireless industry generally) or judicial review before a

concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in compliance,
fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or contributions has not
had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 3.23

of the Company has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in
the Company\'s articles of incorporation and the WBCA applicable to a
"significant business transaction" (as defined in Chapter 23B.19 of the

or in the corresponding section of the Disclosure Schedule delivered by
Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
and signed by an authorized officer of Parent (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule," and together with the Company Disclosure Schedule, the "Disclosure
Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:   Section 4.1
Qualification; Organization, Etc.   (a) Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to own its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. The copies of Parent\'s certificate of
incorporation and by-laws which have been delivered to the Company are
complete and correct copies thereof, each as amended through the date hereof.
Parent is not in violation of any provision of its certificate
of incorporation or by-laws.   (b) Section 4.1 of the Parent Disclosure

other corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity
that is not a Subsidiary but in which Parent owns, directly or indirectly, an
equity interest, in each case identifying the percentage and type of
ownership held by Parent. Each of Parent\'s Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the power and authority to
own its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,

good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, Parent\'s Subsidiaries
which are corporations are validly issued and, if applicable, fully paid and
non-assessable and all of the    30  outstanding shares of capital stock
of, or other ownership interests in, Parent\'s Subsidiaries which are owned

4.3 Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation.   (a) Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has requisite corporate or limited liability company
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The

manager of Merger Sub and, except for the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Secretary of State of Washington, no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the
Voting Agreement have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent
and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement constitute valid and binding agreements of the other parties hereto
or thereto, this Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitute valid and
binding agreements of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and

delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   (c) The execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement and
the Voting Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i)
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any
loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.4 Reports and Financial
Statements.   (a) Parent has filed all forms, documents and reports required
to be filed prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC since December 31,
2002 (the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, Parent SEC Documents
complied in all material respects, and all documents required to be filed by
Parent with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
(the "Subsequent Parent SEC Documents") will comply in all material respects,
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
none of Parent SEC Documents contained, and the Subsequent Parent SEC
Documents will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made,
not misleading.   (b) The consolidated financial statements (including all
related notes and schedules) of Parent included in Parent SEC Documents
fairly present in all material respects, and included in the Subsequent
Parent SEC Documents will fairly present in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then
ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein including
the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2002, Parent has not
made any change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the
preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule
or policy or applicable Law.   Section 4.5 Internal Controls and Procedures.
Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and (f) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act. Parent\'s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Parent\'s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific    
33  authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (d) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Parent has delivered to the Company complete and accurate copies
of notices from its independent auditor of any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in Parent\'s internal control over financial reporting
since December 31, 2003 and any other management letter or similar
correspondence from any independent auditor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since December 31, 2002. Parent has implemented such programs
and taken such steps as it believes are necessary to effect compliance with
all provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable
to Parent and has not received, orally or in writing, any notification that
its independent auditor (i) believes that Parent will not be able to complete
its assessment before the reporting deadline, or, if completed, that it will
not be completed in sufficient time for the independent auditor to complete
its assessment or (ii) will not be able to issue unqualified attestation
reports with respect thereto.   Section 4.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities.
Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in Parent\'s consolidated balance
sheets (or the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents, (ii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, since December 31, 2003, (iii) liabilities or
obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course
of business and (iv) liabilities and obligations arising after December 31,
2003 which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto).   Section 4.7 No Violation of Law;
Permits.   (a) Parent and each of Parent\'s Subsidiaries are in compliance
with and are not in default under or in violation of any Laws applicable to
Parent or such Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets,
including, without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, except where such non-compliance, default
or violation has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
except as would not reasonably be expected to significantly impair or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 4.7(a), no representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made pursuant to this Section 4.7(a) in respect of
matters which are the subject of representations and warranties made pursuant
to Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, and 4.18.   (b) Parent and Parent\'s
Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for Parent and
Parent\'s Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets
or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "Parent
Permits"), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the     34  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and except as
would not reasonably be expected to significantly impair or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. All Parent Permits are
in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
except as would not reasonably be expected to significantly impair or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.8
Environmental Laws and Regulations. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes,
but is not limited to, the possession by Parent and its Subsidiaries of all
Parent Permits required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance
with the terms and conditions thereof, except for such non-compliance or
failure to possess which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent;
and (b) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of, or, is the subject of, Environmental Claims which would reasonably
be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.9 Employee Benefit Plan.   (a)
Section 4.9(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all material Parent
Benefit Plans. "Parent Benefit Plans" means all employee benefit plans,
compensation arrangements and other benefit arrangements, whether or
not "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA,
whether or not subject to ERISA), providing cash- or equity-based incentives,
health, medical, dental, disability, accident or life insurance benefits or
vacation, severance, retirement, pension or savings benefits, that are
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
for the benefit of employees, directors, consultants, former employees,
former consultants and former directors of Parent or its Subsidiaries and all
employee agreements providing compensation, vacation, severance or other
benefits to any officer, employee, consultant or former employee of Parent or
its Subsidiaries, except to the extent providing benefits imposed or implied
by applicable foreign Law.   (b) Any Parent Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge
of Parent, continues to satisfy the requirements for such qualification,
except where the failure to so qualify has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiaries of Parent maintains or
contributes to any benefit plan covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or has engaged in any
transaction which is reasonably likely to result in any liability or penalty
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each Parent Benefit Plan has been
maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and with ERISA
and the Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such non-compliance
which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor
its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any plan or arrangement which,
and no Parent Benefit Plan provides,    35  or has any liability to
provide, life insurance or medical or other employee welfare benefits to any
employee or former employee following his retirement or termination of
employment, except as required by applicable Law. Parent has not amended the
Parent Benefit Plans in any manner whatsoever that would increase materially
the expense to Parent or its Subsidiaries of maintaining the Parent Benefit
Plans above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another
event (A) entitle any current or former employee, consultant or officer of
Parent or any its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as
required by applicable Law, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee, consultant or
officer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.   (c) No Parent
Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, or a "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in
Section 413 of the Code. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies the requirements
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, except where failure to satisfy such
requirements has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   Section 4.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Documents, since December 31, 2003, the businesses of Parent and
its Subsidiaries have been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice, and there has not been any event, occurrence, development or
state of circumstances or facts that has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   Section 4.11 Investigations; Litigation. Except as described in
the Parent SEC Documents:   (a) there is no investigation or review pending
(or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent; and   (b) there are no actions, suits, inquiries, investigations
or proceedings pending (or, to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened) against or
affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties
at law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of
or before any Governmental Entity, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   Section 4.12 Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Other
Information. None of the information with respect to Parent or its
Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or
any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company
Meeting, or, in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it
becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or    
36  omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  
Section 4.13 Lack of Ownership of the Company Common Stock. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of the Company Common
Stock or other securities convertible into shares of the Company Common Stock
(exclusive of any shares owned by Parent\'s employee benefit plans).  
Section 4.14 Tax Matters.   (a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has (A)
duly and timely filed (or there have been filed on its behalf) all material
Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable
extensions) with the appropriate Tax Authority, (B) paid all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns, except for such failures to file or pay which do not
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (b) Except for such Liens
which do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, there are no Liens
for Taxes upon any property or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except for liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or for which adequate
reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP in the most recent
financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the
date of this Agreement.   (c) There is no audit, examination, deficiency,
refund litigation or proposed adjustment with respect to any Taxes other than
those which do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. As of
the date hereof, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has received notice in
writing of any claim made by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, does not file a Tax Return, that
Parent or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to material taxation by that
jurisdiction, where such claim has not been resolved favorably to Parent or
such Subsidiary.   (d) There are no outstanding written requests,
agreements, consents or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations
applicable to the assessment of any income Taxes or income Tax deficiencies
against Parent or any of Parent\'s Subsidiaries, except, in each case, with
respect to income Taxes or deficiencies, as the case may be, which do not
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and, as of the date hereof, no
power of attorney granted by either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any material Taxes is currently in force.   (e) Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement providing for the

exclusively between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated

or otherwise.   (f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has: (A)

prior to the date of this Agreement or (II) in a distribution which could

Merger; or (C) taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from

any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Effective Time as a result of any "closing agreement" described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.   (h) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in
material compliance with all applicable information reporting and Tax
withholding requirements under federal, state and local Tax laws, except for
such failures to comply which do not have, and would not reasonably be

all foreign jurisdictions in which Parent and any of its Subsidiaries files
a material Tax Return.   (j) All of the outstanding equity securities of
Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no

failure to be in full force and effect, or the suspension,
revocation, cancellation or modification of which has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. No Parent License is subject to any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, or is subject to any pending regulatory proceeding (other than
those affecting the wireless industry generally) or judicial review before a
Governmental Entity. Parent and its Subsidiaries have no knowledge of any
event, condition or circumstance that would preclude any Parent License from
being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such Parent License
is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed has not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (c) The licensee of each
Parent License is in compliance with each Parent License and has fulfilled
and performed all of its material obligations with respect thereto, including
all reports, notifications and applications required by the Communications
Act or FCC Rules and the payment of all regulatory fees, contributions to the
Universal Service Fund, the TRS Fund and all other such funds to which
contributions are required by the FCC Rules, except (i) for exemptions,
waivers or similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure to
be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or
contributions has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (d)
Except as provided in the Parent License Schedule, there are no outstanding
material auction or other monetary obligations due to the FCC, and the
completion     40  of the Merger will not give rise to any unjust
enrichment obligations related to Parent Licenses obtained through the FCC\'s
auction process.   (e) Except for structures that do not require
registration, each of the antenna structures used for the operation of the
Parent Licenses has been registered with the FCC, except with respect to
registrations the failure of which to obtain have not had, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Except with the consent of the FCC or as otherwise
permitted in accordance with the FCC Rules, no facility located in the United
States for the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been constructed
in a manner that has resulted in a significant environmental effect, as
defined by FCC Rules, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Other
than as may affect the wireless industry generally, there is no application,
petition, objection or other proceeding pending before any Governmental
Entity that could affect the Parent Licenses or the business operations of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such applications, petitions,
objections or other proceedings that have not had, or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   (f) Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent owns one
hundred percent (100%) of the equity and controls one hundred percent (100%)
of the voting power and decision-making authority of each licensee of the
Parent Licenses.   (g) Section 4.18 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists
all pending federal or state proceedings with regard to efforts by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to be designated as an Eligible Telecommunications
Carrier.   Section 4.19 Parent\'s Certificate of Incorporation. The
provisions contained in Article VIII of the Parent\'s certificate of
incorporation do not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement.
To the knowledge of Parent, no state takeover statute is applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.20
Affiliate Transactions. There are no Parent Material Contracts or other
material transactions or agreements between Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any (a) officer or director of Parent
or of any of its Subsidiaries, (b) record or beneficial owner of five percent
or more of any class of the voting securities of Parent or (c) affiliate of
any such officer, director or beneficial owner.   Section 4.21 No Vote of
Parent Stockholders. No vote of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of
any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise), is required by Law, the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the applicable rules of
the NYSE in order for Parent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger.   Section 4.22
Finders or Brokers. Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, Stephens, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs and Co., a copy of
whose engagement     41  agreements has been provided to the Company,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.   ARTICLE V

liquidated into the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), to keep available
the services of those of their present officers, employees and consultants
who are integral to the operation of their businesses as presently conducted
and to preserve their present relationships with significant customers and
suppliers and with other persons with whom they have significant
business relations; provided, however, that no action by the Company or its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters specifically addressed by any other
provision of this Section 5.1 shall be deemed a breach of this sentence

any employee with, any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(C) enter into any employment agreement with any director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent necessary to replace
a departing employee or as is customary practice in any foreign jurisdiction

without penalty), or (D) establish, adopt, enter into or amend any collective
bargaining agreement, plan, trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the

Representatives to furnish promptly to one another such additional financial
and operating data and other information as to its and its Subsidiaries\'
respective businesses     48  and properties as the other or its
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, except that nothing
herein shall require either the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to the other that would cause a
violation of any agreement to which the disclosing party is a party, would
cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the party disclosing such data or
information, or would constitute a violation of applicable Laws. The parties
hereby agree that each of them will treat any such information in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 24, 2004, between
the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Subject to the
exception in the first sentence of this section and to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company and Parent each agree to confer at such times
as the other may reasonably request with one or more directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company or Parent, as applicable, to report

ongoing operations. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no party shall be obligated to make any disclosure in violation of
applicable Laws or regulations.   Section 5.4 No Solicitation.   (a) The

respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect
to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Company Alternative
Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any nonpublic information with respect to, any Company
Alternative Proposal or in response to any inquiries or proposals that may
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Alternative Proposal (except to
the extent specifically permitted pursuant to this Section 5.4), (iii) engage
in discussions with any person with respect to any Company Alternative
Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions
of this Section 5.4 and except to the extent specifically permitted under
this Section 5.4, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Company Alternative
Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted under this Section 5.4)
or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement
or commitment providing for, any Company Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements specifically permitted under Section 5.4(c)). The
Company shall immediately terminate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or
negotiations, if any, that are ongoing as of the date hereof with any third
party with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal, or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Proposal.   (b)
Promptly after receipt of any Company Alternative Proposal, the Company shall
provide Parent with written notice of the material terms and conditions of
such Company Alternative Proposal, and the identity of the person or group
making any such Company Alternative Proposal. After receipt of the Company
Alternative Proposal, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed in all
material respects of material amendments of any such Company
Alternative Proposal and use all reasonable efforts to promptly provide to
Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in connection
with such Company Alternative Proposal.    49    (c) If the Company
receives a Company Alternative Proposal which (i) constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either
of clause (x) or (y) below, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions (and
in such event it shall provide Parent written notice of the Company\'s
intention to do so (a "Company Action Notice")) (x) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal, if,
and only if, (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) upon
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, the Company
uses all reasonable efforts to furnish concurrently a copy of such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so furnished); and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
the third party with respect to the Company Alternative Proposal.   (d) For
a period of at least forty-eight (48) hours after Parent\'s receipt from the
Company of each Company Action Notice, the Company shall not effect a Company
Change of Recommendation.   (e) In response to the receipt of a Company
Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal after the Company\'s compliance with Section
5.4(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may change, withhold or
withdraw the Company Recommendation (a "Company Change of Recommendation") if
the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a Company
Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach by
the directors of their fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s shareholders
under applicable Law.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i)
the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Meeting and to hold a vote of the Company\'s shareholders on the
approval of the Merger and the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement
at the Company Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Company
Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal), or by any
Company Change of Recommendation and (ii) in any case in which the Company
withholds or withdraws the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4(e),
recognizing that special circumstances, as provided in Section 23B.11.030 of
the WBCA, exist in light of the provisions of this Section 5.4 and/or the
provisions of the Voting Agreement, the Company shall submit this Agreement
and the Merger to a vote of its shareholders with no recommendation as
permitted by Section 23B.11.030(2) of the WBCA.   (g) Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company\'s Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors,    50  such disclosure is required in order
for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations, or is
otherwise required, under applicable Law.   (h) As used in this Agreement,
"Company Alternative Proposal" shall mean any bona fide proposal or offer
made by any person prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval
(other than a proposal or offer by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their affiliates or associates) for (i) the acquisition of the Company by
merger or business combination transaction, or for a "merger of equals" with
the Company; (ii) the acquisition by any person of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or
(iii) the acquisition by any person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (i) As used in this Agreement
"Company Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide Company Alternative
Proposal made by any person (and which has not been obtained by or on behalf
of the Company in violation of this Section 5.4 and with respect to which the
Company has fulfilled its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4) on terms
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company\'s financial and legal advisors, and
considering such factors as the Board of Directors considers to
be appropriate (including the conditionality and timing of such proposal),
are more favorable to the Company and its shareholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Section 5.5 Proxy Material; Registration
Statement.   (a) The Company and Parent shall together (unless any action
is specifically identified as the obligation of only one of the parties
hereto) or pursuant to an allocation of responsibility to be agreed upon
between them:   (i) As soon as is reasonably practicable, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and Parent and the Company shall prepare and Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act with
respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger (the "Registration
Statement") which shall, except to the extent provided in Section 5.4(e),
include the recommendation of the Company\'s Board of Directors that the
Company\'s shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement, and shall each use
all reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC under
the Exchange Act and the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC
under the Securities Act;   (ii) as soon as is reasonably practicable
Parent shall take all such action as may be required under state blue sky or
securities laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   (iii) Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the NYSE
and such other stock exchanges as shall be agreed upon listing applications
covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and use all
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the
listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject only to official notice of
issuance;    51   (iv) cooperate with each other in order to lift
any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein; and   (v) cooperate with each other
in obtaining a written opinion of its respective legal counsel, Jones Day or
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, in the case of the Company and Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, in the case of Parent ("Tax Counsel"), in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent, respectively (each such
opinion, a "Tax Opinion"), dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect
that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in
such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Parent and the Company each will be
treated as a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b)
of the Code. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to Tax
Counsel for purposes of the Tax Opinion customary representations and
covenants, including those contained in certificates of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Tax
Counsel.   (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other than
this Section 5.5(b)), the parties agree that Parent may convert Merger Sub
from a limited liability company to an entity treated as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes in the event that Parent reasonably determines
(following consultation with the Company) that such change would result in
significant tax savings and will not have an adverse effect on the tax
treatment of the shareholders of the Company, provided, however, that such
change shall not be made if either Parent or the Company is advised by its
Tax Counsel that such change would result in such Tax Counsel\'s inability to
render the opinion specified in Section 6.1(g).   (c) Subject to the
limitations contained in Section 5.3, the Company and Parent shall each
furnish the other and to its counsel all such information as may be required
in order to effect the foregoing actions, and each represents and warrants to
the other that no information furnished by it in connection with such
actions, or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
order to make any information so furnished, in light of the circumstances
under which it is so furnished, not misleading.   (d) The Company shall
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act.   (e) The Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the WBCA and its articles of incorporation and by-laws to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as
promptly as practicable following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval (the "Company Meeting") and, subject to Section
5.4, shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders the
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company    52  Recommendation").
Subject to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, the Company will use all reasonable
efforts to solicit from its shareholder proxies in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and will take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
shareholders required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market and the WBCA to
obtain such approvals. The Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company
Meeting if there are sufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Meeting and the Company believes such shares will
be voted in number sufficient to approve and adopt this Agreement and
the Merger. The Company shall ensure that the Company Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by the
Company in connection with the Company Meeting are solicited, in compliance
with the WBCA, its articles of incorporation and by-laws, the applicable
rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market and all other applicable legal requirements.
The Board of Directors of the Company shall not withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, other than to the extent permitted and in
compliance with Section 5.4 of this Agreement.   Section 5.6 Affiliate
Agreements. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, deliver to Parent
a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Parent), setting forth the
names and addresses of all persons who are, at the time of the Company
Meeting, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of the Company
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall furnish
such information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the
purpose of reviewing such list. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause each person who is identified as an "affiliate" in the
list furnished pursuant to this Section 5.6 to execute a written agreement on
or prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, in the form of Exhibit B
hereto.   Section 5.7 Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Employee Matters.  
(a) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding unexpired and
unexercised option to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common
Stock under the Option Plan or otherwise (each, a "Company Stock Option")
shall be converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Stock Option Conversion Fraction
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock which could
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time upon the exercise of each such
option (rounded to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share
(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share
of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option divided by the
Stock Option Conversion Fraction, and all references to the Company in each
such option shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where appropriate. The other
terms of such Company Stock Options shall continue to apply in accordance
with their terms, including any provisions for the acceleration of vesting
resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or any subsequent termination of employment) pursuant to such
preexisting terms and conditions. Each Company Stock Option converted
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.7(a) shall be referred to as a
"Parent Exchange Option." In connection with the issuance of Parent Exchange
Options, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that will become subject to Parent Exchange Options pursuant to
this Section 5.7(a). As promptly as reasonably practicable after   
53  the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to each holder of an outstanding
Parent Exchange Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption by
Parent. Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form that Parent is eligible to use) under the
Securities Act on the Closing Date with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to Parent Exchange Options and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective until
the exercise or expiration of the Parent Exchange Options. For purposes of
this Section 5.7(a), the Stock Option Conversion Fraction shall mean the sum
of (x) the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio plus (y) the fraction
resulting from dividing the Per Share Cash Amount by the closing price per
share of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.   The number of shares subject to
any Parent Exchange Option and the exercise price per share of such Parent
Exchange Option shall be determined in a manner which would not result in the
conversion of Company Stock Options into Parent Exchange Options being
treated as a new grant of stock options under Section 409A of the Code, and
the Company and Parent shall agree upon any adjustments to this Section
5.7(a) necessary to avoid such new grant of stock options.   (b) Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to
the terms of the ESPP in order to (i) shorten the offering period under the
ESPP in effect at the Effective Time (the "Current Offering"), such that the
Current Offering shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) ensure that no offering periods under the ESPP commence after the date
hereof, (iii) permit participants in the ESPP to exercise, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, any purchase rights existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the ESPP to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock at the purchase price set forth in the ESPP and (iv)
refund to participants in the ESPP the funds that remain in
the Participants\' accounts after such purchase. At the Effective Time the
Company shall terminate the ESPP.   (c) Employee Benefits.   (i) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of one year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to current and former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees")
welfare, compensation and employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements
(it being understood that discretionary equity and equity based awards will
remain discretionary) that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than
those provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time; it
being understood that nothing contained herein shall preclude Parent
from changing or terminating any existing plan, program or arrangement
pursuant to its terms, so long as Parent complies with the provisions of this
sentence. Following such one year period, Company Employees will receive
compensation and benefits pursuant to the welfare, compensation and employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Parent as then in effect other
than plans, programs and arrangements of Parent that are not open to new
participants generally (such as "frozen" pension plans).    54   (ii)
For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under pension or similar plans) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time, provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or
for newly established plans and programs for which prior service of Parent
employees is not taken into account. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to Company employee
benefit plan or compensation arrangement or agreements in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.   (iii) The Company may provide a retention
pool (the "Retention Pool") for the purpose of retaining the services of key
Company Employees, on the terms set forth on Section 5.7(c)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Subject to the terms set forth on Section
5.7(c)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, John Stanton, or in the event
that he is not able to perform such function, his designee (Mr. Stanton or
such designee, the "Administrator"), shall determine the size of the
Retention Pool, the Company Employees eligible to receive retention awards
from the Retention Pool (each a "Retention Bonus") and any criteria for
payment of the Retention Bonus, and shall determine the final allocation of
payments from the Retention Pool. Participants in the Retention Pool shall
receive, within 10 days following employment termination, any Retention Bonus
which would have been otherwise due to them in the event that their
employment is constructively terminated or terminated without cause or as a
result of death or disability prior to the date of required service for the
Retention Bonus. The Administrator shall be indemnified for all good
faith actions taken in connection with the Retention Pool, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law. Parent shall have no obligation to make
payments pursuant to the Retention Pool in the event this Agreement   
55  is terminated or abandoned. The decision of the Administrator upon all
matters within the scope of its authority shall be conclusive and binding on
all parties.   (iv) Parent shall honor the Company severance program
(the "Program") set forth on Section 5.7(c)(iv) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that shall be applicable in the event of a participant\'s qualifying
termination (as described in the Program) of employment during the two (2)
year period immediately following the Closing. The Program shall be
administered by the Administrator, who shall have discretionary authority
with respect to the interpretation and application of the Program. The
decision of the Administrator upon all matters within the scope of its
authority shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. The Administrator
shall be indemnified for all good faith actions taken in connection with the
Program, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.   Section 5.8
Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (1)
the occurrence of any event known to it which would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on
it or (B) cause any condition set forth in Article VI to be unsatisfied in
any material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time; or (2) any
action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened which questions or challenges the
validity of this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the
party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters
solely by virtue of having given such notice.   Section 5.9 Filings; Other
Action.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts
(subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company
Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting

later than fifteen (15) days after    56  the date hereof make their
respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under
the HSR Act, (ii) promptly (but in no event later than fifteen (15) days
after the date hereof) file applications (the "FCC Applications") required to
be filed with the FCC to effect the transfer of control of the Licenses (the
"FCC Consents") and respond as promptly as practicable to any additional
requests for information received from the FCC by any party to an FCC
Application, (iii) use all reasonable efforts to cure not later than the
Effective Time any violations or defaults under any FCC Rules, (iv) use all
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether
any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities (including any foreign
jurisdiction in which the Company\'s Subsidiaries are operating any business)
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making
all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals, (v) use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, taking all such further action
as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities
of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may assert
under relevant antitrust or competition laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (vi) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.   (c) In
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained
in this Section 5.9, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Regulatory Law (as defined below), each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use all reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.9 shall
limit a party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
or 7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with
its obligations under this Section 5.9.   (d) If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such
Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be required to, or the Company be
permitted to, agree to any divestiture of any businesses, assets or product
lines of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in order
to enable any approval under any Regulatory Law that is    57  necessary
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, except as set forth on Section 5.9(d) hereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, the Communications Act and all other federal, state or foreign, if
any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and
judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or lessening competition, whether in the communications
industry or otherwise, through merger or acquisition.   Section 5.10
Takeover Statute. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and
Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 5.11 Public Announcements. The Company and
Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and

Agreement.   Section 5.12 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts

claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Parties"), of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
by-laws or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Company shall (i) maintain in effect (A)

any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective directors, officers and employees existing as on the date
hereof, and (ii) jointly and severally indemnify the Indemnified Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall either cause

liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase a
"tail policy", in either case, of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no   
58  less advantageous to the insured with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in
no event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 200% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance for the year ending
December 31, 2005 (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.12 it shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount.   (b) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their heirs and legal representatives.   (c) The rights of the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives under this
Section 5.12 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may
have under the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any other applicable Laws.   (d) In the event
that either Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons,
or (B) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets to any Person, then
and in each case, proper provision shall be made so the applicable successors

5.12.   Section 5.13 Accountants\' "Comfort" Letters. The Company and Parent
will each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to
each other letters from their respective independent accountants, dated as of

business days prior to filing it with the SEC and provide as soon as
practicable any material changes thereto.   (d) To the extent required in
connection with the preparation of any registration statement or other report

59  reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall use all reasonable

Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with
respect to equity securities of Parent or the Company.   Section 5.16

operations.   Section 5.17 Internal Controls and Procedures.   (a) The

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) From the date hereof until the

implementing such programs and taking such steps as it believes are necessary
to effect compliance with all provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act that will become applicable to the Company.   Section 5.18 Real Estate
Transfer Taxes. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer tax
with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by

of shareholders of the Company.   Section 5.19 Parent Covenant Concerning
