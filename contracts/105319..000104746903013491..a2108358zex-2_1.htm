On the Closing Date, the Sellers will deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth all Delayed Transfer Assets and Delayed Transfer Liabilities existing as of the Closing Date (the "Delayed Transfer Assets and Liabilities Schedule"). 

  

 (b) _ Subsequent Transfers._ Subject to Section 2.6(a), in the event that at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date any Seller (or any member of the Sellers Group) becomes aware that it possesses any Asset or Assumed Liability that is allocated to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such Seller or member of the Sellers Group shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such Asset or Assumed Liability to the Buyer. Prior to any such transfer, the Person possessing such Asset or Assumed Liability shall hold such Asset or Assumed Liability in trust for the Buyer. 

  

 (c) _ Separation of Contractual Arrangements._ On or prior to the Closing Date and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, Buyer and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to amend all material Contracts between or among (i) members of the Sellers Group, on the one hand, and (ii) any other Person, on the other hand (other than the contractual arrangements relating to the transactions contemplated hereby), that relate to both the Transferred Business and the Retained Business (the "Common Contracts"), including the Common Contracts set forth on Schedule 2.6(c) hereto, so that, after the Closing Date, such Common Contracts shall be equitably apportioned between the respective Businesses, including, if commercially practicable, on substantially the same economic terms as such arrangements exist as of the Closing Date. 

  

  

 If, in the case of a Common Contract relating primarily to or used primarily in connection with the Transferred Business, such amendments cannot be obtained, or if an attempted amendment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect in a material respect the rights of Buyer or the Sellers thereunder, Buyer and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement under which (i) the Sellers shall obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under such Common Contract to the extent relating to the Retained Business, including by entering into sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing arrangements for the benefit of the Sellers, or 

    (ii) Buyer shall enforce for the benefit of the Sellers, with the Sellers
assuming Buyer\'s obligations, any and all rights of Buyer against a third
party thereto to the extent relating to the Retained Business.

  

 If, in the case of a Common Contract relating primarily to or used primarily in connection with the Retained Business, such amendments cannot be obtained, or if an attempted amendment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect in a material respect the rights of Buyer or the Sellers thereunder, Buyer and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement under which (i) Buyer shall obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under such Common Contract to the extent relating to the Transferred Business, including by entering into sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing arrangements for the benefit of Buyer, or (ii) the Sellers shall enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming the Sellers\' obligations, any and all rights of the Sellers against a third party thereto to the extent relating to the Transferred Business. 

  

 Buyer shall assume and be responsible for 77% of any costs and expenses charged by a third party to a Common Contract to apportion a Common Contract between the Parties, whether in the nature of a consent, sub-licensing or similar fee, and the Sellers shall assume and be responsible for 23% of such costs and expenses. 

  

 2.7 _ Governmental Approvals and Consents._ (a) If the transfer, assignment or assumption of any Delayed Transfer Asset or any Delayed Transfer Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed hereunder is not consummated on the Closing Date, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.6(a) or for any other reason, then the member of the Sellers Group retaining such Delayed Transfer Asset or such Delayed Transfer Liability shall thereafter hold such Delayed Transfer Asset or such Delayed Transfer Liability for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably practicable, of Buyer. In addition, the member of the Sellers Group retaining such Delayed Transfer Asset or such Delayed Transfer Liability shall take such other actions in order to place Buyer, insofar as reasonably practicable, in the same position as if such Delayed Transfer Asset or such Delayed Transfer Liability had been transferred or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Transfer Asset or such Delayed Transfer Liability, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Asset, are to inure from, and after the Closing Date to, Buyer. To the extent permitted by law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any Legal Impediment or required Consent and/or Governmental Approval, Buyer shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management and the benefits and burdens of any Delayed Transfer Asset or any Delayed Transfer Liability not yet transferred to or assumed by it as a result of Section 2.6(a) and the Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto. If and to the extent that such arrangement cannot be made, Buyer shall not have any obligation with respect to such Delayed Transfer Asset or Delayed Transfer Liability. Buyers and Sellers agree, and agree to cause their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates, to treat Buyer as the owner as of the Closing Date of any Delayed Transfer Assets and any Delayed Transfer Liabilities for all tax purposes. 

  

 (b) If and when the Legal Impediments and the Consents and/or Governmental Approvals, the failure to remove or the absence of which caused the deferral of the transfer or assumption of any Asset or Assumed Liability pursuant to Section 2.6(a), are removed or obtained, as the case may be, the transfer and assumption of the applicable Asset or Assumed Liability shall be promptly effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without the payment of additional consideration. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Sellers agree, and agree to cause their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates, to use their reasonable best efforts to remove all Legal Impediments and obtain, before the Closing Date, any Consent (other than Consents with respect to Leases) or Governmental Approval required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 3.1 _ Closing Date._ On and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, located at 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, at 10 a.m., New York City time, on April 1, 2003, if all conditions set forth herein have been satisfied or waived prior to April 1, 2003, or, if all conditions set forth herein have not been satisfied or waived prior to April 1, 2003, at such other time and place as shall be agreed upon by the Parties hereto. The day on which the Closing actually takes place is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

Buyer and the Companies agree to allocate the purchase price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the Companies and among the Assets of each Seller in accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code and in the manner set forth in _Schedule 3.2_. Buyer and the Companies agree to act in accordance with such allocations in all Tax Returns, reports or filings, including the IRS Form 8594, and any similar or analogous forms under any state, local or foreign tax law, to be filed with respect to any Company. Neither Buyer nor any Company shall, after filing any IRS Form 8594 (or similar or analogous form), revoke or amend such IRS Form 8594 (or similar or analogous form) without the prior written consent of the other. 

  

 3.3 _ Post Closing Adjustment._ (a) Within 120 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers (i) a statement (the "Statement") setting forth (x) the deposits (including security deposits) and prepaid expenses (including applicable property taxes) constituting part of the Assets as of the opening of business on the Effective Date (the "Section 3.3 Assumed Assets") and (y) the amount of the obligations and liabilities of Sellers assumed by Buyer as of the opening of business on the Effective Date that are not Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "Section 3.3 Assumed Liabilities") and (ii) the workpapers of Buyer used in the preparation of the Statement. The Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. The date upon which Buyer delivers the Statement to Sellers shall be the "Statement Delivery Date." 

  

 (b) After receipt of the Statement, Sellers will promptly review the Statement together with the workpapers used in its preparation. Buyer shall provide Sellers with access to the relevant books and records and employees of Buyer to the extent required to review the Statement. Unless Sellers deliver written notice to the Buyer setting forth the specific items disputed by Sellers, on or prior to the thirtieth calendar day after the Statement Delivery Date, Sellers will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Statement and such agreement will be final and binding. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify the basis of such objection, including identifying any alleged miscalculation or alleged uncounted or improperly included items, and Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Statement. If Sellers so notify Buyer on a timely basis of their objections to the Statement, Buyer and Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items. Any resolution by Buyer and Sellers as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive. 

   

 (c) If Buyer and Sellers do not resolve all disputed items within sixty (60) calendar days after the Statement Delivery Date, then all items remaining in dispute will be submitted within thirty 

     

 (30) calendar days to Ernst and Young, LLP or such other national independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the "
_Neutral Auditor_ "). The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Neutral
Auditor shall be limited to whether the disputed items in the Statement were
prepared and calculated in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Section 3.3 and whether there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in
such calculation, and the Neutral Auditor shall not make any
other determinations. The Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to
determine only those items remaining in dispute. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be
borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. The
Neutral Auditor will deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination
(such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Auditor by the Sellers and Buyer) of
the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the
disputed items, which determination, in the absence of manifest error, will be
final, binding and conclusive. The final, binding and conclusive Statement,
which is agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers and/or is delivered by the Neutral
Auditor in accordance with this Section 3.3(c), will be the " _Conclusive
Statement_." For purposes of this Section 3.3(c), the date of delivery of the
Conclusive Statement shall be the " _Final Determination Date_." In the event
that either Buyer or Sellers fail to submit their respective statement
regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time specified above,
then the Neutral Auditor shall render a decision based solely on the evidence
timely submitted to the Neutral Auditor by Buyer and Sellers.

In the event that the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Assets exceeds the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Liabilities, then Buyer shall pay WWG, on behalf of the Sellers, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, an amount equal to the difference between the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Assets and the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Liabilities. In the event that the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Liabilities equals the amount of Section 3.3 Assumed Assets, no payment shall be required and no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price.

 (b) An Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the Indemnitor (including a Third Party Claim, as hereinafter defined) which an Indemnitee has determined has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement. No failure to give such Notice of Claim shall affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnitor can demonstrate such failure materially prejudiced such Indemnitor\'s ability to successfully defend the matter giving rise to the claim. The Notice of Claim shall state the nature of the claim and the amount of the Loss, if known. 

   

 (c) The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnitor under this Article 9 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the indemnification provisions provided for in this Article 9 (" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: The Indemnitee at the time it gives a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor of the Third Party Claim shall advise the Indemnitor that Indemnitor shall be permitted, at its option, to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnitee within twenty (20) days of the Indemnitor\'s receipt of the Notice of Claim. In the event the Indemnitor exercises its right to undertake the defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense and make available to the Indemnitor all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee may participate by its own counsel and at its own expense in defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the defendants in any Action shall include both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor and such Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded in good faith that counsel selected by the Indemnitor has a conflict of interest because of the availability of different or additional defenses to such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate counsel to participate in the defense of such Action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided, further, that such Indemnitor shall not, in connection with 

     

 any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related
actions, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee, during the period the
Indemnitor is determining whether to elect to assume the defense of a matter
covered by this Section 9.3, may take such reasonable actions as it deems
necessary to preserve any and all rights with respect to the matter, without
such actions being construed as a waiver of the Indemnitee\'s rights to
defense and indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Similarly, in the
event the Indemnitee is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the
Indemnitee in such defense and make available to it all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in its possession or under its control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor may participate by its own counsel and at its own expense in the
defense of such Third Party Action. Except for the settlement of a Third Party
Claim which involves the payment of money only, no Third Party Claim may be
settled or judgment entered by consent by the Indemnitor without the written
consent of the Indemnitee, or by the Indemnitee without the written consent
of the Indemnitor which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ that the Indemnitee shall not be required to consent to any
settlement or judgment which (i) does not include as a term thereof the
delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a duly executed
written unconditional release of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates from all
liability in respect of such claim or (ii) involves the imposition of
equitable remedies, the imposition of any material obligations on or the
waiver or compromise of any material rights of such Indemnitee or its
Affiliates.

Any Party may, at its own expense, be entitled to participate as an observer in the proceedings with respect to any such claim.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Indemnitor makes any payment pursuant to this Article 9, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment and to the extent permitted by law, to any rights and remedies of the Indemnitee to recoup such amounts paid from third parties with respect to the matters giving rise to indemnification hereunder.

 11.5 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, including without limitation, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 24, 2003 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between WWG and WWI and the letter agreement, dated March 7, 2003 (the " _Letter of Intent_ "), between Sellers and WWI; _provided_ nothing in this Section 11.5 shall relieve any party from any liability for any breach of such party\'s covenants or agreements contained in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Letter of Intent. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party acknowledges that it has made its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions provided for herein without relying upon any express or implied representations, warranties, commitments or undertakings of any other Party, or such other Party\'s Representatives or Affiliates, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and in the other agreements to be executed and delivered hereunder. 

   

 11.6 _ Binding Effect._ This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 11.7 _ Bulk Sales Law._ The Parties agree to waive compliance with the provisions of the bulk sales law of any jurisdiction. Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all liabilities that may be asserted by third parties against Buyer as a result of such noncompliance. 

   

 11.8 _ Assignability._ This Agreement shall not be assignable, in whole or in part, by any Party hereto without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto; _provided_ that without the consent of the Companies Buyer may assign any or all its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates and to a lender in connection with the financing of all or any portion of the Purchase Price. 

  

 11.9 _ No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of the Companies, Buyer, WWI or any of their respective Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including, without limitation, any right to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind under or by reason of this Agreement. Except as provided in Article 9, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the Parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 11.10 _ Amendment; Waiver._ This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified only by a written instrument executed by each of the Parties hereto. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein, or in any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the Closing hereunder. The waiver by any Party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. 

     

 11.11 _ Confidentiality._ (a) Except as and to the extent required by law or otherwise permitted pursuant to the Franchise Agreements or this Agreement, Buyer and WWI agree not to disclose or use, and will direct their Representatives not to disclose or use, at any time prior to or after the Closing Date, any Confidential Information with respect to the Companies furnished or to be furnished by the Companies or any of their respective Representatives to Buyer, WWI or their Representatives at any time or in any manner other than in connection with the evaluation and consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement or as otherwise permitted by the Franchise Agreements relating to the Retained Territories; _provided_ that, after consummation of the Closing, any such Confidential Information to the extent relating to the Assets or the Transferred Business may be disclosed or used by Buyer, WWI and their respective Representatives for any purpose. For the purposes hereof, " _Confidential Information_ " means any proprietary information about the Companies unless such data or information (a) is already known to Buyer or WWI or their Representatives or to others not bound by any duty of confidentiality or such information is publicly available through no fault of Buyer, WWI or their Representatives, (b) becomes available to Buyer or WWI or their Representatives from a source other than the Companies or their Representatives, _provided_ that such source is not known by Buyer, WWI or their Representatives, as the case may be, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual or legal obligation of secrecy to the Companies or another party, (c) is independently developed by Buyer or WWI, or on their behalf, (d) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement or (e) the furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with legal proceedings. 

  

 (b) Except as and to the extent required by law, the Companies agree not to disclose or use, and will direct its Representatives not to disclose or use, at any time on or after the Closing Date any confidential information with respect to the Assets or any other aspect of the Transferred Business. For the purposes hereof, "confidential information" shall not include any data or information (a) publicly available through no fault of the Companies or their Representatives, or (b) the furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with legal proceedings or required by law. 

  

 (c) In the event that any Party or any of its Representatives is required in connection with any legal proceeding or by applicable law or regulation or legal process to disclose any confidential information, such Party or its Representative shall give prompt notice to the other Party, to the extent possible, of such request so that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the disclosing Party will, at the other Party\'s expense, use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Party to obtain such protective order. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the other Party waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, such Party will furnish only that portion of the confidential information, which is legally required, in the opinion of its counsel, to be disclosed. If in the absence of a protective order such disclosing Party is nonetheless compelled to disclose confidential information, such disclosing Party or its Representative may disclose such information without liability under this Agreement if the disclosing Party or its Representative gives the other Party written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon such Party\'s request, at the other Party\'s expense, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Party to the Agreement (and any Representative of any Party to this Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any such information relating to the tax treatment or 

     

 tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to
comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws.

  

 11.12 _ Schedules._ Any item disclosed in the Schedules attached hereto, under any specific Schedule number hereof, shall be deemed to have been disclosed only for purposes of such Schedule. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto shall not necessarily mean that such fact or item is material. 

   

 11.13 _ Section Headings; Table of Contents._ The section headings contained in this Agreement and the Table of Contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 11.14 _ Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect. 

   

 11.15 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. 

  

 11.16 _ APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (" _PROCEEDINGS_ "), EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY (I) SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN NEW YORK CITY; AND (II) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE AT ANY TIME TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND FURTHER WAIVES THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THAT SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SUCH PARTY. PROCESS IN ANY PROCEEDING REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION 11.16 MAY BE SERVED ON ANY PARTY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

   

 11.17 _ Further Assurances._ Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, from and after the Closing, upon the reasonable request of any other Party hereto and without further consideration, such Party will promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver to such other Party such documents and further assurances and will take such other actions (without cost to such Party) as such other Party may reasonably request in order to carry out the purpose and intention of this Agreement. 

  

 11.18 _ Other Franchise Agreements._ Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.5, no provision of this Agreement shall amend or waive any provision of any franchise agreement relating to the Weight Watchers business between WWI, on the one hand, and the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, including, without limitation, WWI\'s right of first refusal, if any, with respect to any such franchise. 

  

 11.19 _ Time of Essence._ Time shall be of the essence with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first above written.
