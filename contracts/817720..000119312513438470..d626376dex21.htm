iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of October 9, 2013 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among
Synpatics Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Acquirer_ "), Itsme
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Acquirer (" _Sub I_"), Itsme Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer (" _Sub II_",
together with Sub I, the " _Merger Subs_ "), Validity Sensors, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company solely in its capacity as
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent (as defined in _Section 8.4(a)_).

RECITALS

 

 __A. The Boards of Directors of the Company, Merger Subs and Acquirer have
determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of the
stockholders or members of their respective companies that Sub I merge with
and into the Company (the " _First Merger_ "), pursuant to which the Company
would be the surviving corporation and become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquirer, and, as part of the same overall transaction, the surviving entity
of the First Merger would merge with and into Sub II (the " _Second Merger_ ",
and together with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with Sub II to
survive the Second Merger and continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquirer, all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Mergers, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. __

 

B. The parties intend that the Mergers taken together will qualify as a tax
free reorganization under Section 368(a)(i)(A) of the Code and that this
Agreement be, and be hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 

C. Pursuant to the First Merger, among other things, the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (and rights to acquire
same) shall be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration
herein described in the manner set forth herein.

 

D. The Company, Merger Subs and Acquirer desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection
with the Mergers as set forth herein.

__E. Immediately following execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquirer to enter into this Agreement, each
Company Stockholder listed on _Exhibit B-1_ will execute and deliver (a) a
written consent substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B-2_
(the " _Company Stockholder Consent_ ") approving the Mergers and related
items and adopting this Agreement and approving the Restated Charter; (b) a
stockholder agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
B-3_ (the " _Company Stockholder Agreement_ "). __

 

F. On or before the consummation of the Mergers, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) secure from each Company Stockholder
an executed Company Stockholder Agreement (or as herein provided a Joinder
Agreement in substantially

 



1  the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_), (b) secure from each Company
Optionholder an executed Company Optionholder Agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B-4_ (the " _Optionholder Agreement_ ")
and (c) secure from each Company warrant holder (other than the Excluded
Company Warrantholders) an executed Company Warrantholder Agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B-5 _(the "
_Warrantholder Agreement_ "), as applicable.

 

 __G. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquirer to enter into this Agreement, each
of the Company Securityholders identified on _Exhibit C-1A_ hereto (each a "
_Company Principal Stockholder_ ") is executing and delivering to Acquirer (i)
an Investment Representation Letter and Lock-Up Agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C-2A_, in each case to become effective
upon the Closing and (ii) a Stockholder Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit B-3_. __

__H. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquirer to enter into this Agreement, all
eight of the Company employees identified on _Exhibit D-1_ (the " _Tier 1 Key
Employees_ ") have executed employee offer letters (including a non-
disclosure and inventions assignment agreement and such other forms provided
by Acquirer and as are part of Acquirers standard policy for commencement of
employment) with Acquirer or Subs (collectively, the " _Employment Documents_
"), in each case to become effective upon the Closing. __

 

 __I. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquirer to enter into this Agreement, no
fewer than ten (10) of the twelve (12) employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries identified on _Exhibit D-2_ (the " _Tier 2 Key Employees_ ")
have executed Employment Documents, in each case to become effective upon the
Closing. __

__J. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the stockholders of
the Company holding sufficient shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock will execute and deliver consents with respect to all shares
of Company Capital Stock (the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") they hold
evidencing (i) the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, and the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and (ii) the
adoption of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (" _Restated
Charter_ " and the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ " respectively). The
shares of Company Capital Stock held by the consenting stockholders shall
collectively constitute (i) at least a majority of the voting power of the

class, (ii) at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, (iii) at

Acquirer Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from
Acquirer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the

10 (viii) _Cash Rounding_. The amount of cash each holder of Company

(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this Section 1.8(a) for the shares of Company
Capital Stock held by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash
amounts for all shares of Company Capital Stock represented by any stock
certificates held by such holder of Company Capital Stock.

 

(ix) _Company Options and Excluded Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time,
each vested and unvested Company Option and Excluded Company Warrant that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into, subject to
and in accordance with Section 1.9, the right to receive, for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Excluded Company
Warrant, (A) cash in an amount, if any, equal to any Pro Rata Earnout Payment
Per Share associated with any Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 5.19(a) or Section 5.19(b) (subject to set-off for payment of
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Merger Consideration Recipients under Article 8), less the applicable
exercise price of such Company Option or Excluded Company Warrant, provided
that the applicable exercise price of such Company Option or Excluded Company
Warrant had not already been subtracted from a previous Pro Rata Earnout
Payment Per Share, and (B) cash in an amount equal to any Reallocated Earnout
Consideration Per Share associated with any Earnout Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 5.19(a) or Section 5.19(b) (subject to set-off for
payment of Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations
of the Merger Consideration Recipients under Article 8) and reallocated
pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 1.8(a)(ix) (such right to possibly receive
cash, the " _CR_ "). Such conversion into a CR will be without acceleration of
the vesting of the underlying Company Option (except in the case of non-
continuing employees to the extent that such acceleration results from pre-
existing agreements). The amount of cash each Company Optionholder or Excluded
Company Warrantholder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
1.8(a)(ix) for the Company Options or Excluded Company Warrants held by such
Company Optionholder or Excluded Company Warrantholder as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all Company Options or Excluded Company Warrants
held by such Company Optionholder or Excluded Company Warrantholder. The
installment payments received by a holder of a Company Option or Excluded
Company Warrant under this Section 1.8(a)(ix) are intended to be separate
"payments" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 409A_ "). Each CR resulting from a Company
Option (an " _Option CR_ ") will continue to vest on the same schedule as the
Company Option it replaced, except as otherwise set forth below in this
Section 1.8(a)(ix). Whether or not a holder of an Option CR is employed by
Acquirer or the Surviving Entity on any Earnout Record Date, he or she will
be entitled to receive Earnout Consideration on each payment date. If,
however, a holder of an Option CR is no longer employed by Acquirer or the
Surviving Entity at the time of any Earnout Record Date, he or she
will receive payment only to the extent of his or her aggregate vesting
before and following the Closing through such employees termination date, but
taking into account any acceleration of Company Options only for (i) holders
thereof as may be agreed by Acquirer or (ii) holders thereof who are not
continuing employees of Acquirer or the Surviving Entity at the Effective
Time. For example, if a holder of an Option CR holder were 50% vested at
Closing 

 



11  and left Acquirers employ 12 months later after vesting another 25%, he
would receive 75% of the Option CR payments, if any, attributable to the Pro
Rata Earnout Payment Per Share he would have been entitled to receive for
such Option CR had he remained employed through the applicable Earnout Record
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of an Option CR who continues to
be employed by Acquirer or the Surviving Entity as of any Earnout Record Date
will receive payment as to the then unvested portion of his Option CR, as well
as the then vested portion, due on the payment date. The portion of any Pro
Rata Earnout Payment Per Share that would otherwise never be
distributed because it represents amounts allocated to holders of unvested
Option CRs which do not vest due to termination of employment prior to the
Earnout Record Date will lapse and (i) be retained by Acquirer (in the case of
voluntary terminations, i.e., those that are not involuntary terminations as
provided below) (each such Option CR an " _Unvested Voluntary Termination CR_
") or (ii) be reallocated and paid to the Eligible Effective Time Holders in
accordance with Section 5.19 in an amount equal to the Reallocated Earnout
Consideration Per Share in the case of involuntary terminations (each such
Option CR an " _Unvested Involuntary Termination CR_ "). For this purpose,
an "involuntary termination" means one in which the employee is terminated or
receives severance.

(x) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant (other
than Excluded Company Warrants) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without
consideration.

 

(xi) _Maximum Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate consideration
distributable by Acquirer to the Company Securityholders: (i) at Closing
exceed the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration; and (ii) at any time exceed the
sum of (A) the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration and (B) the total Earnout
Payments payable pursuant to _Section 5.19._

(xii) _Treatment of Sub I Stock and Sub II Membership Interests_. At the
Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Sub I shall be cancelled
and converted into one share of common stock of the First Step Surviving
Corporation. At the Second Effective Time, all of the shares of common stock
of the First Step Surviving Corporation that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will, by virtue of the Second
Merger and without further action on the part of the sole stockholder of
Sub I, be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. At the
Second Effective Time, all of the membership interests of Sub II that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will
constitute, all of the membership interests of the Final Surviving LLC. Such
membership interests shall be the only equity interests of the Final Surviving
LLC outstanding immediately after the Second Effective Time.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. All shares of
Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration therefor.

 

(c) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to

 



12  the Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of
shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided
for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change.

 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the cash amount provided for in _Section 1.8_, but shall instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware
Law, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive
payment therefor in accordance with Delaware Law (but only after the value
therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose
their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be
converted into the right to receive the applicable stock or cash amount
provided for in _Section 1.8_ in respect of such shares as if such shares
never had been Dissenting Shares, and Acquirer shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in this Agreement,
following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Merger Consideration to which such holder would be entitled in
respect thereof as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Acquirer (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or
purchase received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company and
(ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal or purchase under Delaware Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Acquirer, or as otherwise required
under Delaware Law, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect
of any Dissenting Shares. The payout of consideration under this Agreement to
the stockholders of the Company (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares
who shall be treated as provided in this _Section 1.8_ and under Delaware
Law) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal
rights or dissenters rights under Delaware Law by any other stockholder of
the Company.

 

(e) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Company Securityholders as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to each such Company
Securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason otherwise than by
operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted
transfer of such right by any holder thereof (otherwise than as permitted by
the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

1.9. _P AYMENTS MADE AT CLOSING; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall act as exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Mergers.

 



13 (b) _Acquirer Deposit_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date), Acquirer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article 1_, (i) the

of all of the Service Provider Deliverables from the applicable service
provider seeking payment of Transaction Expenses, Acquirer shall pay the

on the Spreadsheet. " _Service Provider Deliverables_ " shall mean a full and
final bill for all services rendered by or on behalf of such service provider
to Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and in any event through and including the Closing Date, certified as such, a
signed Form W-9 and accurate wire transfer information for such service
provider.

 

(d) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any
event, within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall

Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby,
(A) the holder of record of such

 



14  Certificate shall be entitled to receive, solely with respect to the Company
Preferred Stockholders, a certificate representing the number of whole shares
of Acquirer Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive at Closing

payment in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  _Section 1.8(a)(viii)_ in respect to such Certificate), and
cash that any such holder has the right to receive in connection with the
Earnout or subject to it being deposited in escrow pursuant to this Agreement
and (B) such Certificate shall be canceled.

(iii) As soon as reasonably practical after the date of delivery to the
Exchange Agent of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documentation reasonably required thereby, the holder of record of a Company
Option and the holders of Excluded Company Warrants shall receive a CR in
accordance with the terms of  _Section 1.8(a)(ix)_.

(e) _Acquirer to Cause Deposit of Escrow Amount and Agent Expense Amount_. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and in no event later

be deposited with U.S. Bank, N.A. (or another institution selected by Acquirer
and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) as escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ ") the Escrow Amount and the Agent Expense Amount. The Escrow Amount
shall constitute security for the indemnification obligations of the Merger
Consideration Recipients pursuant to _Article 8_, and shall be held in and
distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The
Agent Expense Account shall held in and distributed in accordance with the
provisions of the Escrow Agreement and be available to cover the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent Expenses and such funds shall not be available
to Acquirer to cover Indemnifiable Damages and no portion of the Agent Expense
Amount shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund.

(f) _No Interest_. No interest shall accumulate on any shares of Acquirer
Common Stock issuable, or cash payable in connection with the Mergers (other
than interest accrued on the Escrow Amount according to the Escrow Agreement).

 

(g) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable
or cash amount payable pursuant to  _Sections 1.8(a)_ and _(d)_ , is to be
issued or paid to a Person other than the Person to which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the
payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall have paid to Acquirer or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the
shares of Acquirer Common Stock or payment of cash in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Acquirer or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.9_, none of the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Entity or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



15 (i) _Unclaimed Shares; Unclaimed Cash_. Any cash or certificates of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock (including any distributions made thereon) or portion of
funds (including any interest earned thereon) held by the Exchange Agent which
have not been delivered to any holders of Certificates pursuant to this 
_Article 1_ within six (6) months after the Effective Time shall promptly be
returned to Acquirer, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by _Section 1.9_ shall look only to Acquirer (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for its claim, only as a general
unsecured creditor thereof, to shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable or
cash amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate has not been surrendered
prior to the earlier of the third anniversary of the Effective Time or such
date on which the Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 1.8_ in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any Acquirer Common Stock issuable or cash payable
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of Acquirer, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

1.10. _N O FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK, COMPANY
OPTIONS OR COMPANY WARRANTS_. All cash and shares of Acquirer Common Stock
paid or payable and/or issued or issuable following the surrender for exchange
of shares of Company Capital Stock, Excluded Company Warrants and Company
Options in accordance with the terms hereof shall be so paid or payable
and/or issued or issuable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, Excluded Company Warrants and/or Company
Options, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company
Warrants or Company Options that were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, such Certificate shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1\.

1.11.  _L OST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the record holder thereof, such shares of Acquirer
Common Stock and cash as may be required pursuant to Section 1.8 in respect of
such Certificate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirer or the Exchange
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in
such sum and/or execute an indemnification agreement as Acquirer or the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Acquirer, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their
respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.

1.12. _T AX CONSEQUENCES_. It is the intent of the parties hereto that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Mergers shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" in respect of the
Mergers for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Acquirer does not
warrant to the Company or to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company
Options or Company Warrants that the Mergers will constitute
a "reorganization." The Company acknowledges that the Company and the holders
of Company Capital Stock, Company Options

 



16  and Company Warrants are relying on their own Tax advisors in connection
with this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions and agreements
contemplated hereby.

 

1.13. _W ITHHOLDING RIGHTS_. Acquirer, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise deliverable, and any other payments otherwise required
pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, any Company Options, any Company Warrants or any Certificates such
amounts in cash or shares as Acquirer, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such deliveries and
payments under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
delivered and paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

1.14. _E XEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION; FORM S-3 REGISTRATION_. The shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to be issued in connection with the First Merger are
being issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities
Act, by reason of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated
thereunder (a " _Private Placement_ ") and, therefore, may not be re-offered
or resold other than in conformity with the registration and/or qualification
requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable State blue sky
securities laws and regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The
certificates issued by Acquirer with respect to the shares of Acquirer Common
Stock issued hereunder shall be legended to the effect described above and
shall include such additional legends as necessary to comply with applicable
U.S. federal securities laws, State blue sky securities laws and such other
restrictions as shall be set forth in the Company Stockholder Agreement, the
Investment Representation Letter and Lock-Up Agreement, and the Investment
Representation Letter, if applicable. Acquirer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and file an automatic shelf registration
statement (within the meaning of such term in Instruction I.D to Form S-3)
with the SEC covering the resale of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to
the Aggregate Closing Stock Number. Acquirer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such filing prior to the later of (i) twenty
(20) days after Closing and (ii) five (5) days after the completion of the
financial statements required by Items 9.01(a) and (b) of Form 8-K (in each
case assuming timely receipt of the Spreadsheet, all information relating to
the Effective Time Holders for inclusion in such registration statement, and
all signatures, opinions and consents required for such registration statement
and Form 8-K and that SEC activity is not delayed by pending government shut
down). The parties will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to complete
such financial statements as soon as reasonably possible, which efforts shall
include, without limitation, (i) the review by the Companys independent
auditors of any required interim financial statements, (ii) completion of any
footnotes and schedules required to be included with such financial statements
and (iii) the obtaining of any consents of Companys auditors required for
Acquirer to use Companys audited financials in Companys public securities
filings so as to enable Company to timely make the filings required on Form
8-K and the filing of such Form S-3. If, as and when additional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock are issued as Earnout Consideration with respect to any
Measurement Period, Acquirer will exercise commercially reasonable efforts,
within 30 days after the date of such issuance, to increase the total number
of shares of Acquirer Common Stock registered on such registration statement
(or a successor registration statement) by way of a prospectus supplement or
otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 



17  in no event will the Acquirer be obligated to register more than the Maximum
Registrable Shares. Acquirer will keep such registration statement effective
until its termination date.

 

1.15. _T AKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Entity are fully authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action
necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

1.16. _C ONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENTS; SEVERANCE_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration, there
shall be an adjustment made for the Companys net working capital and net
cash at Closing in an amount as calculated in accordance with this _Section
1.16_ (the " _Aggregate Net Adjustment Amount_ "). The Aggregate Net
Adjustment Amount shall be calculated as the aggregate amount equal to:

(i) Applicable Net Cash minus the Net Cash Peg Amount (" _Net Cash Adjustment
Amount_ "), plus

(ii) Closing Net Working Capital minus the Net Working Capital Peg
Amount, provided that such amount is (A) equal to or greater than **** or (B)
less than or equal to ****(the " _Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ").

 

(b) In connection with calculating the Aggregate Net Adjustment Amount, the
Company shall deliver, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date, to Acquirer a written statement that shall include and
set forth a good-faith estimate of (i) Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) Applicable Net Cash as
of the Applicable Date (with each of Closing Net Working Capital and
Applicable Net Cash determined without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein or any Transaction Expenses, severance or any Aggregate
Option Proceeds). Closing Net Working Capital and Applicable Net Cash shall be
calculated in accordance with GAAP (and if they are not, the amounts of
Closing Net Working Capital and Applicable Net Cash specified in the first
sentence, and the amounts of Net Working Capital Peg Amount and Net Cash Peg
Amount, respectively, specified below shall be adjusted accordingly). For
purposes of determining the amounts payable on the Closing Date, the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be based on the Closing Net Working
Capital, and the Net Cash Adjustment Amount shall be based on the Applicable
Net Cash, each determined in accordance with this _Section 1.16(a)_.

 

(c) For purposes of calculating the Aggregate Net Adjustment Amount, the
following definitions shall apply:

 

(i) " _Applicable Date_ " shall mean the date of the Closing, if Closing
occurs on or before ****, and shall mean ****, if Closing occurs after ****.

 



18 (ii) " _Applicable Net Cash_ " means (A) the cash and cash equivalents of the
Company, minus (B) Company Debt (for the sake of clarity, which specifically
excludes, without duplication or double counting, any Transaction Expenses or
the Severance Offset Amount), plus (C) an amount equal to any Transaction
Expenses paid prior to Closing that are deducted from the Adjusted Closing
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.16(e)_ below, each as of the open of
business on any date.

 

(iii) " _Net Cash Peg Amount_ " shall mean ****.

 

(iv) " _Net Working Capital_ " means (A) the aggregate consolidated current
assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents, minus (B) the
aggregate consolidated current liabilities of the Company (including current
Tax Liabilities), excluding Company Debt, and excluding, without duplication
or double counting, any Transaction Expenses and the Severance Offset Amount,
each as of the start of business on any date, and, in any event, shall exclude
any Tax assets except for Tax prepayments directly related to any Tax
Liability taken into account hereunder.

 

(v) " _Net Working Capital Peg Amount_ " shall mean ****.

 

(d) For the sake of clarity, if the Aggregate Net Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, then such negative number shall be added to (and not
subtracted from) the Aggregate Gross Closing Consideration for purposes of
calculating the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration.

 

(e) Further, the amount of any Transaction Expenses (for the avoidance of
doubt including those paid before Closing) as set forth in the Company
Closing Financial Certificate will be a reduction in the computation of the
Adjusted Net Closing Consideration, as provided in the definition thereof.

 

(f) Acquirer will bear the severance expenses of (a) the Companys Chief
Executive Officer, not to exceed six months base salary, plus the cost of
maintaining such officers health benefit plans (by COBRA reimbursement or
otherwise) for such six month period (but for the avoidance of doubt not
including any amounts payable pursuant to any contingent or performance bonus
arrangement in connection with the Transaction), and (b) the Designated
Employees. The Designated Employees severance will not exceed the amounts set
forth on _Exhibit 1.16(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any bonuses or
other severance amounts not referenced above in this _Section 1.16(f)_ paid
or payable to Companys directors, employees and/or consultants or other
service providers (" _service providers_ ") in connection with the
Transaction, other than pursuant to agreements entered into between such
service providers and Acquirer (collectively, " _Severance Offset Amount_ ")
will be a reduction in the computation of the Adjusted Net Closing
Consideration, as provided in the definition thereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence "bonuses or other
severance amounts" shall not be deemed to refer to the value of vesting
acceleration pursuant to pre-existing agreements currently in place for
Company service providers, but shall include all future guaranteed or
performance bonuses, which have been committed by the Company to any current
or former service providers and shall include any amounts payable under any
contingent or performance bonus arrangements.

Stock or (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under

Company.

 

(d) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to the Company or any

with respect to the Company and/or any Subsidiary, a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations

neither the Company nor Acquirer has incurred or will incur any liability or
obligation to withhold taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting
of any Company Options.

 

(r) The Company has made available to Acquirer correct and complete copies of
all election statements under Section 83(b) of the Code, together with

employee directors, consultants or other service providers, in each case to
the extent in the Companys possession.

 

2.13. _E MPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS_.

(a) _Schedule 2.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, with respect
to the Company or its Subsidiaries and any trade or business (whether or not

_ERISA Affiliate_ ") within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code, (i) all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
"), (ii) each loan to an employee, (iii) other than the Company Option Plans,
all stock option, restricted stock unit, equity incentive, stock purchase,
phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance,
sabbatical, medical, dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation,
training, tuition assistance, cafeteria benefit (Section 125 of the Code),

 



42  dependent care (Section 129 of the Code), life insurance or accident
insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (iv) all bonus, pension, profit
sharing, savings, severance, retirement, deferred compensation or incentive
plans, programs or arrangements, (v) all other fringe or employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements that apply to senior management and that do
not generally apply to all employees, and (vi) all employment or executive
compensation or severance agreements, written or otherwise, as to which
unsatisfied obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of greater
than $1,000 remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or
former employee, consultant or non-employee director of the Company or such
Subsidiary (all of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through (vi),
collectively, the " _Company Employee Plans_ "). Correct and complete
copies of all material documentation relating to the Company Employee Plans
have been made available to Acquirer or Acquirers counsel prior to the
Agreement Date.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Acquirers counsel a true, correct and
complete copy of each of the Company Employee Plans and related plan
documents (including trust documents, insurance policies or Contracts,
employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and other authorizing documents,
and any material employee communications relating there) and has, with
respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting
requirements, made available to Acquirers counsel true, correct and complete
copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to apply) to the
Internal Revenue Service for such a determination letter prior to the
expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or
Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such
determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a
standardized prototype plan for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion
letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting
employer. The Company has also made available to Acquirer a true, correct and
complete copy of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or
opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the issuance of each
such letter which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax
qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary sponsors or maintains material
any self-funded Company Employee Plan, including any plan that includes stop-
loss coverage.

(c) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any Person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_
") or similar state law and the Company has complied in all material respects
with the requirements of COBRA. There has been no "prohibited transaction"
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and
not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance thereunder)
with respect to any Company Employee Plan in respect of which the Company or
any Subsidiaries would have liability. Each Company Employee Plan has been
administered, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules
and regulations (including ERISA

 



43  and the Code) and the Company and each ERISA Affiliate has performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under, is not
in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any default or
violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans in any
material respect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is
subject to any Liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the
Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans.
All contributions required to be made by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or
before their due dates or if not due have been properly accrued on the
Financial Statements. In addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of
employee salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Department of
Labor. No Company Employee Plan is covered by, and neither the Company nor
ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV

or distributor who, in the year ended December 31, 2012 or the 6 month period

for the Company and its Subsidiaries, based on amounts paid or payable in
such periods (each, a " _Significant Customer_ "), and the Company has no
knowledge of any material dissatisfaction with the Company on the part of any
Significant Customer. Each Significant Customer is listed on _Schedule

Contracts with the Company or such Subsidiary (or the Surviving Entity or
Acquirer). The Company has not had any of its products returned by a purchaser
thereof except for normal warranty returns consistent with past history and
those returns that would not result in a reversal of any revenue by
the Company.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any outstanding material
dispute concerning products and/or services provided by any supplier who, in
the year ended December 31, 2012 or the 6 month period ended June 30, 2013,

have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in
accordance with the Companys and its Subsidiaries past practices and are
sufficient to provide for any losses which may be sustained on realization of
the receivables. The accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries
arising after the Balance Sheet Date and before the Closing Date arose or
shall arise in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practices, represented or shall represent bona fide claims against debtors for
sales and other charges, less allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty
returns determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. No material

termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
benefit under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from any Person
pursuant to, (i) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Acquirer, in each case as amended to date, or (ii) any applicable
Legal Requirement, except where such conflict, violation, default,
termination, cancellation or acceleration, individually or in the aggregate,

consummate the Mergers or to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, is required by or with

obligations under this Agreement and would not prevent, materially alter or
delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.3. _S TOCK CONSIDERATION_. The shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued
by Acquirer to the holders of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of

duplication of benefits, (iii) with respect to the vesting of awards under
Acquirers equity compensation plans, if any, or (iv) with respect to personal

any third party rights of causes of action for any person

preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions of the its

provides written notice to the Company no later than three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date that such plan shall not be terminated). Unless
Acquirer provides such written notice to the Company, no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Acquirer
with evidence of such resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval
of Acquirer. Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
retirement plan maintained by it or one of its Affiliates that is qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code to accept direct and indirect rollover
distributions, on behalf of the Continuing Employees, of account balances
maintained by them under any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify as a

bonuses, termination payment, accelerated vesting payments, benefits, options
and/or stock provided pursuant to agreements, contracts or arrangements that
might otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any
amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such stockholder vote to be sought in
a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Acquirer, prior to the initiation

Company, any Subsidiary and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the
initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section 5.13,
and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to
receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code.

 



68 5.14. _T ERMINATION OF FINANCING STATEMENTS_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.20, the Company shall take all actions necessary such that (i) UCC-2
or UCC-3 termination statements, as applicable, have been filed with respect

interests in assets of the Company that have not yet expired, and to obtain

security interest in the Companys patents in favor of Silicon Valley Bank
have been released and (ii) all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) on assets of the Company shall be released prior to or
simultaneously with the Closing.

 

5.15. _I NSURANCE_. Prior to the Closing, the Company may obtain up to a six
year prepaid "tail policy" for its current and former directors and officers
(" _Indemnified D andOs_") with coverage amounts as the Company may determine in
its sole discretion prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _ however_ , that the
fees and expenses associated with such "tail policy" for the term of such tail
policy (" _Tail Policy Premium_ ") shall be treated as a Transaction Expense
for purposes of calculating Adjusted Net Closing Consideration, the Aggregate
Net Adjustment Amount and Applicable Net Cash, as applicable without
duplication, which shall be reflected in the Company Closing Financial
Certificate. Acquirer shall cause the Surviving Entity to cause to
be maintained in effect such "tail policy" during such six year period.
Acquirer will not, or will cause the Company not to, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect. This Section 5.13 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified DandOs, their heirs
and personal representatives, and shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers from and after the Effective Time, to benefit the Indemnified DandOs. In
the event Acquirer or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, Acquirer and the Surviving Entity shall use their best
efforts to ensure proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Acquirer or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.15.

 

5.16. _D IRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION_. For a period of six years
following the Effective Time, Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Company to,
fulfill the obligations of the Company to indemnify each Person who is or was

applicable indemnification agreement as in effect on the Agreement Date and
pursuant to the terms of the Companys certificate of incorporation, bylaws
and other organizational documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

5.17. _T AX MATTERS_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility and payment of Taxes as between Acquirer, the Company and the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders) for certain Tax matters prior to and following the Closing Date:

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to
be filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
(taking account of extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay
all Taxes with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , the

 



69  Company shall provide a copy of any income and other material Tax Return to
Acquirer for its review and comment no later than fifteen (15) days before the
date on which such Tax Return is due, and no such Tax Return shall be filed
without consent of Acquirer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

 

(b) Acquirer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries that relate to all Tax periods ending before the Closing and that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking account of
extensions).

 

(c) Acquirer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods.

(d) Unless the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and Acquirer otherwise
agree in writing, all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed under
_Section 5.16 (a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_ shall be prepared consistent with past
practices (for the most recent Tax periods for which Tax Returns involving
similar matters have been filed) unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements. For any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company prepared by or on behalf of Acquirer that includes a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period, including an amended Tax Return, which shows Taxes
that are due and for which Acquirer expects to make a claim for
indemnification, Acquirer shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent for its review and comment at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is to be filed.

 

(e) The filing of any amended Return of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company covering any period prior to the Closing Date, the Straddle Period or
any post-Closing period will not in itself be the basis of any indemnification
claim.

(f) If, subsequent to the Closing, Acquirer, Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof shall receive written notice of an audit, examination,
claim, or other administrative or judicial proceeding, contest, assessment,
notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, dispute or controversy relating to
Taxes (each, a " _Tax Contest_ ") with respect to Taxes the payment of which
is the responsibility of the Company or the Effective Time Holders or for
which the Effective Time Holders would have an indemnification obligation,
Acquirer shall promptly notify the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent in
writing of such Tax Contest, provided that the failure of Acquirer to give
such notice shall not relieve the Effective Time Holders of their
indemnification obligations, except to the extent that they or the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a
result of such failure. Acquirer shall timely keep the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Contest.

(g) In the event that Acquirer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
propose to compromise or settle any Tax claim, or Tax Contest or otherwise
agree to any Tax liability relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Period or that could otherwise give rise to Indemnifiable
Damages under this Agreement, the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall
have the right to review such proposed compromise, settlement, consent,
agreement or amendment. _Section 8.4(e)_ shall apply to any Tax Contest.

 



70 (h) Each of Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, on the one hand,
and Acquirer, the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Acquirer or the
Company, on the other hand, shall: (a) provide assistance to the other party
as reasonably requested in preparing and filing Tax Returns or determining any
Tax liability or right to refund, in each case, for any Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period, (b) make available to the other party as reasonably requested
all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods ,
and (c) retain any books and records that could reasonably be expected to be
necessary or useful in connection with any preparation by the other party of
any Tax Return. Each of Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, Acquirer, the
Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Acquirer or the Company shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include retaining
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and
its Subsidiaries until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation
(taking into account any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and abiding by all record retention agreements with any Tax authority
and, upon a partys reasonable request, providing records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any Tax Contest, making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information, and explaining
any materials provided pursuant to any such request.

 

(i) Except for any real, personal and intangible property Taxes or similar ad
valorem Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") and as otherwise provided herein, the
Taxes of the Company or its business, assets or activities for that portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be computed on a
"closing-of-the-books" basis as if such Tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the Taxes of the Company or its business,
assets or activities for that portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date shall be computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis as if
such Tax period began on the day after the Closing Date. Property Taxes of the
Company for any Straddle Period shall be computed on a per diem basis and
allocated between the period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date based on the number of
days in such periods divided by the total number of days in the relevant
Straddle Period.

 

(j) Unless otherwise required by law, absent the consent of the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent, the parties shall report the Mergers, taken
together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.

 

(k) For the portion of the calendar day after the Effective Time, other than
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Acquirer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in the ordinary course in
the same manner as heretofore conducted (and, for the avoidance of doubt, none
of Acquirer, the Company or their Affiliates shall be permitted to make an
election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Company or
any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period).

 

(l) The Effective Time Holders shall be responsible for the payment of all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, excise, registration, documentary
transfer, real estate transfer or gain, and other such similar Taxes and fees,
including any Indian Taxes imposed on Acquirer, the Merger Subs or the Company
because the Mergers cause a taxable transfer of the 

 



71  Indian subsidiary of the Company (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The applicable Person shall prepare all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation that it is required to prepare under applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

 

(m) Subject to _Section 8.1(i)_, the Company will, and will instruct its
accountants to, cooperate as reasonably required in assisting Acquirer to
complete its review and analysis of the application of Section 382 of the Code
to the net operating loss carryforwards of the Company prior to giving effect
to the Mergers (including the report delivered by Company under _Section
1.3(a)(xviii)_.

and filing of, any application, notification (including any notification or
provision of information, if any, that may be required under the HSR Act or
other applicable federal, state or foreign antitrust law) or other document
that may be necessary in order to obtain the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period or the authorization, approval or consent of any
Governmental Entity, whether federal, state, local or foreign, which may be
reasonably required, or which the Company may reasonably request, in

all such authorizations, approvals and consents and shall pay any associated
filing fees payable by Acquirer, the Surviving Entity or the Company with
respect to such authorizations, approvals and consents. Acquirer shall
promptly inform the Company of any material communication between Acquirer
and any Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers or any other transaction

any formal or informal request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then Acquirer shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request.
Acquirer shall direct, in its sole discretion, the making of such response,
but shall consider in good faith the views of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly execute and file, or join in the execution and
filing of, any application, notification (including any notification or
provision of information, if any, that may be required under the HSR Act or
other applicable federal, state or foreign antitrust law) or other document
that may be necessary in order to obtain the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period or the authorization, approval or consent of any
Governmental Entity, whether federal, state, local or foreign, which may be
reasonably required, or which Acquirer may reasonably request, in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable

provisions of _Section 5.8_, any expenses fees payable by the Company with
respect to such authorizations, approvals and consents. The Company shall
promptly inform Acquirer of any material communication between the Company
and any Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or any of its Affiliates

respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company
shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a
response in compliance with such request. The Company shall direct, in its
sole discretion, the making of such response, but shall consider in good faith
the views of Acquirer.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as in violation of any federal, state or foreign laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust
Laws_ "), it is expressly understood and agreed that: (i) Acquirer shall not
have any obligation to litigate or contest or remove any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) Acquirer shall be
under no obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or
submit to orders providing for (A) the sale, license or other disposition or
holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Acquirer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (B) the imposition of any limitation
or regulation on the ability of Acquirer or any of its Affiliates to freely

the Surviving Entity and each of its subsidiaries to operate its business and
conduct its affairs as determined in Acquirers sole and absolute discretion

(xiii) " _Sale_ " means the sale and delivery by or for the account of
Acquirer of a Unit to an OEM or end customer (including such sales and

(b) _Mobile Unit Earnout_. Subject to Acquirers set-off rights under _Article
8_, the mobile unit earnout consideration (the " _Mobile Unit Earnout
Consideration_ ") to be potentially paid to the Effective Time Holders by
Acquirer will be an amount equal to up to $40,000,000 in the form of an
earnout based on revenues recognized by Acquirer (in accordance with GAAP, as
historically applied by Acquirer) with respect to Sales of Mobile Units, net
of returns, samples, allowances and/or other customary revenue adjustments or
reversals made by Acquirer, or Mobile Unit Licensing Revenues recognized by
Acquirer, in each case from Closing through December 31, 2014 (" _Mobile Unit
Earnout Period_ "), as follows:

 

(i) The Mobile Unit Earnout Consideration will be paid for Sales of Mobile
Units during the Mobile Earnout Period (i) at a rate of **** per **** Mobile
Unit sold (i.e., as to which revenue is recognized by Acquirer) that is within
the first **** Mobile Units as to which revenue is recognized by Acquirer
during the Mobile Unit Earnout Period and (ii) at a rate of **** per ****
Mobile Unit sold (i.e., as to which revenue is recognized by Acquirer) that is
within the first **** Mobile Units as to which revenue is recognized by
Acquirer during the Mobile Unit Earnout Period, provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no case will a Mobile Unit generate both a **** and a
**** earnout payment.

(ii) The Mobile Unit Earnout Consideration will be paid with respect to
Mobile Unit Licensing Revenue that is recognized by Acquirer during the Mobile
Unit Earnout Period at the rate of **** of Mobile Unit Licensing Revenue so
recognized.

 

In no event will the Mobile Earnout Consideration payable from Sales of Mobile
Units and with respect to Mobile Unit Licensing Revenue during the Mobile
Unit Earnout Period exceed $40,000,000. Licensee Mobile Units manufactured,
sold or distributed by Licensees will not count against the **** Mobile Unit
ceiling set forth in _Section 5.19(b)(i)_ and shall not count with respect
to achievement of the **** Threshold. The Mobile Unit Earnout Consideration,
if any, will be paid by the date provided in _Section 5.19(g)_ following the
end of each fiscal quarter during the Mobile Unit Earnout Period in which
revenues from Sales of Mobile Units or Mobile Unit Licensing Revenue are
recognized by Acquirer (subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to
the dispute resolution procedure set forth in _Section 5.19(e)_ and 
_Section 9.8_). Acquirer disclaims any, and shall have no, express or implied
obligation to exercise best efforts to achieve or maximize Mobile Unit Earnout
Consideration.

 

(c) _Post **** Earnout_. Subject to Acquirers set-off rights under _Article
8_, the post **** earnout consideration (the " _Post **** Earnout
Consideration_ ") to be potentially paid to the Effective Time Holders by
Acquirer will be up to an additional $122,500,000 in the form of an earnout
based on revenues recognized by Acquirer (in accordance with GAAP, as
historically applied by Acquirer) with respect to Sales of Units, net of
returns, samples, allowances and/or other customary revenue adjustments or
reversals, made by Acquirer or from Unit Licensing Revenues recognized by
Acquirer from Closing through

 



75  March 31, 2016 (" _Post **** Earnout Period_ "), but in either case, only
from and after the time that Acquirer has recognized revenue from Sales of the
first **** Units during the Post **** Earnout Period (the "**** Threshold")
as follows:

(i) The Post **** Earnout Consideration will be paid for Sales of Units in
excess of the **** Threshold (i) at a rate of **** per **** Unit sold
(i.e., as to which revenue is recognized) by Acquirer and (ii) at a rate of
**** per **** Unit sold (i.e., as to which revenue is recognized by Acquirer)
that in each case is in excess of the **** Threshold during the Post ****
Earnout Period, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no case will a
Unit generate both a **** and a **** earnout payment. 

(ii) The Post **** Earnout Consideration will be paid with respect to Unit
Licensing Revenue that is recognized during the Post **** Earnout Period
after the **** Threshold has been satisfied at the rate of **** of Unit
Licensing Revenue so recognized, _provided_ , _however_ , that for the
purposes of this calculation, all Mobile Unit Licensing Revenue for which
Mobile Earnout Consideration is payable pursuant to _Section 5.19(b)(ii)_
shall be excluded from Unit Licensing Revenue under this _Section
5.19(c)(ii)_.

 

In no event will the Post **** Earnout Consideration payable from Sales of
Mobile Units and with respect to Unit Licensing Revenue recognized during the
Post **** Earnout Period exceed $122,500,000. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event will any single Mobile Unit or Unit give rise to both Mobile Unit
Earnout Consideration and Post **** Earnout Consideration; however, Sales of
Mobile Units will count for purposes of satisfying the **** Threshold. No
credit will be given with respect to satisfaction of the **** Threshold with
respect to Licensee Units manufactured, sold or distributed by Licensees. The
Post **** Earnout Consideration, if any, will be paid by the date provided in
_Section 5.19(g)_ following the end of each fiscal quarter during the Post
**** Earnout Period in which revenues from Units are recognized by Acquirer
(subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedure set forth in _Section 5.19(e)_ and _Section 9.8_ ). Acquirer
disclaims any, and shall have no, express or implied obligation to exercise
best efforts to achieve or maximize Post **** Earnout Consideration.

(d) _Set-off Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this  _Section
5.19_, any Earnout Consideration payment is subject to Acquirers right to set
off against that Earnout Consideration to recover Indemnifiable Damages
related to Fundamental Claims and Set-off Claims pursuant to and subject to
the limitations set out in _Article 8_.

(e) _Calculation of Earnout Consideration; Dispute Resolution_. Each calendar
quarter during the Mobile Unit Earnout Period or during the Post **** Earnout
Period is herein referred to as the " _Measurement Period_." Within sixty (60)
calendar days after the expiration of each applicable Measurement Period,
Acquirer shall prepare and deliver to the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent a statement setting forth in reasonable detail Acquirers good faith
calculation of the applicable Earnout Consideration due for that Measurement
Period, as well as any proposed set-off under _Article 8_ and the basis
therefor (the " _Earnout Amount Calculation Statements_ "). Acquirer shall
afford to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent reasonable access during
normal business hours (subject to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent
agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement to the 

 



76  same extent as though the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent were a
party thereto), and upon reasonable notice after delivery of each Earnout
Amount Calculation Statement by Acquirer to the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent, to the books of account and records used by Acquirer to
prepare such Earnout Amount Calculation Statement for purposes of the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent verifying the calculation of the applicable
Earnout Consideration (which shall be provided to the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent in electronic format to the extent reasonably available).
The Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall notify Acquirer in writing
within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of an Earnout Amount Calculation
Statement as to whether the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent disputes
the determination of the Earnout Consideration, setting forth in
reasonable detail the specific items in dispute and the basis for the dispute
(an " _Earnout Payment Dispute Notice_ "), and for clarity, a communication
from the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent that does not dispute the
amount or method of calculation of the Earnount Consideration set forth in an
Earnout Calculation Statement but disputes any right of set-off under _Article
8_ for Indemnifiable Damages shall not be an Earnout Payment Dispute Notice
for the purposes of this _Section 5.19(e)_ , and any such dispute shall be
resolved solely as set forth in _Article 8_. If (i) the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent does not deliver an Earnout Payment Dispute Notice within
thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of an Earnout Amount Calculation
Statement, or (ii) the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent accepts the
amounts set forth in an Earnout Amount Calculation Statement in writing (the
earlier of (i) or (ii) the " _Preliminary Resolution Date_ "), the Earnout
Consideration calculations (as applicable) as contained in such Earnout Amount
Calculation Statement shall be deemed final and binding on Acquirer, the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and the Effective Time Holders. In the
event an Earnout Payment Dispute Notice is delivered, Acquirer and the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent (or the designated representative of the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent) shall meet within twenty (20)
Business Days of the delivery of such Earnout Payment Dispute Notice to
attempt to resolve such dispute in good faith. If a final resolution of such
dispute is reached as reflected in an agreement in writing, the agreed upon
Earnout Consideration shall be deemed final and binding on Acquirer, the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and the Effective Time Holders (the
date thereof, the " _Party Resolution Date_ "). If no final resolution is
reached within twenty (20) Business Days of the delivery of such Earnout
Payment Dispute Notice after good faith negotiation, either Acquirer or the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent may require that the dispute (other
than a dispute as to the calculation of any aspect of the applicable Earnout
Amount Calculation Statement) be resolved in accordance with the dispute
resolution mechanism set forth in _Section 9.8_ (the date of such resolution,
the " _Arbitration Resolution Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
dispute relates to the method of calculation of any aspect of the applicable
Earnout Amount Calculation Statement, the parties shall engage an auditing
firm mutually acceptable to Acquirer and the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent (the " _Reviewing Accountant"_ ) and the parties shall submit the
dispute to the Reviewing Accountant for final resolution. The Reviewing
Accountants shall be authorized only to arbitrate the calculation of Earnout
Consideration and the underlying accounting basis, but shall not have any
authority to arbitrate any other dispute relating to the matters addressed in
this _Section 5.19_. The Reviewing Accountants shall be instructed to review
the applicable Earnout Amount Calculation Statement, the Earnout Payment
Dispute Notice and all work papers related thereto to determine the Earnout
Consideration and use every reasonable effort to determine such amounts within
sixty (60) days after the submission of such dispute to it, and in any event,
as soon as practicable. The 

 



77  Reviewing Accountant shall not undertake any review of any matters not
specifically identified by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent as being
in dispute in the Earnout Payment Dispute Notice and shall only decide the
specific items under dispute by the parties and solely in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Reviewing Accountants determination shall be
based solely on presentations by Acquirer and the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent and an independent review by the Reviewing Accountants of
the books and records of Acquirer and on the definitions and other terms
included herein. The Reviewing Accountants shall set out the resolution
of the dispute in writing, which shall be conclusive and binding on Acquirer,
the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and the Effective Time Holders ("
_Accountant Resolution Date_ "). The costs and expenses of the
Reviewing Accountants shall be borne (i) by Acquirer if the difference
between the Earnout Consideration as determined by Acquirer and as determined
by the Reviewing Accountants is greater than the difference between the
Earnout Consideration as determined by the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent and as determined by the Reviewing Accountants or (ii) by the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders to be
allocated among them on the basis of each such Merger Consideration
Recipients Pro Rata Escrow Percentage set out in the Spreadsheet) if the
difference between the Earnout Consideration as determined by Acquirer and as
determined by the Reviewing Accountants is lower than the difference between
the Earnout Consideration as determined by the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent and as determined by the Reviewing Accountants, or (iii) 50%
by Acquirer and 50% by the Merger Consideration Recipient (to be allocated
among them on the basis of each Merger Consideration Recipients Pro Rata
Share of the merger consideration received by all of the Effective Time
Holders under this Agreement), in any other case.

 

(f) The Earnout Consideration, once it becomes payable hereunder, shall be
paid to the Eligible Effective Time Holders as provided in _Section 1.8(a)_,
subject to set-off as provided in _Article 8_, as follows:

(i)  _Earnout Payments in Acquirer Common Stock  Series C-2B Liquidation
Preference_. Initially, the Earnout Consideration shall be paid to Eligible
Effective Time Holders who held Series C-2B Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time (and which did not become or remain Dissenting Shares),
in the form of shares of Acquirer Common Stock valued at the Reference Price
until such time as such holders collectively have received an amount inclusive
of any amounts set-off pursuant to _Article 8_ hereof (the " _Remaining C-2B
Preference Amount_ "), which together with amounts previously distributed
pursuant to _Section 1.8_ hereof is equal to the Series C-2B Liquidation
Preference Amount. If the Current Price with respect to an Earnout Payment
made prior to payment of the Remaining C-2B Preference Amount pursuant to this
_Section 5.19(f)(i)_ is less than the Reference Price, then the Current
Price, and not the Reference Price, shall be used for purposes of (i)
determining the allocation of such Earnout Payment (or later Earnout Payments
as needed to satisfy the Remaining C-2B Liquidation Preference Amount), as
provided in this Section 5.19(f), among the Eligible Effective Time Holders
who held Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) calculating the application of any such Earnout Payment or any such later
Earnout Payment to the Remaining C-2B Preference Amount (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Reference Price shall be the sole measure used for
purposes of calculating the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable
by Acquirer in connection with any Earnout Payment under this  _Section
5.19_). The difference between (A) the aggregate number of shares of

 



78  Acquirer Common Stock that would have been issued in payment of the
Remaining C-2B Preference Amount if calculated solely at the Reference Price
and (B) the aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock actually
issued hereunder in payment of the Remaining C-2B Preference Amount hereunder
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Shortfall Shares_." To the extent that
there are Shortfall Shares included in any Earnout Payment that are required
to be reallocated in respect of the Remaining C-2B Liquidation Preference
Amount as provided in this Section 5.19(f), such shares will be deducted on a
pro rata basis, solely from Earnout Consideration that otherwise would have
been issuable pursuant to _Section 5.19(f)(ii)_ below to Eligible Effective
Time Holders who held Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and not from Earnout Consideration due to holders of CRs or to
Eligible Effective Time Holders who held Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and reallocated pro rata to the holders of Series C-2B
Preferred Stock until such time as the Remaining C-2B Liquidation Preference
Amount is satisfied. To the extent that there are insufficient Shortfall
Shares available for reallocation in a single Earnout Payment, the same
reallocation will be made as to later Earnout Payments until the balance of
the Remaining C-2B Liquidation Preference Amount is satisfied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt: (i) in no case
shall the foregoing mechanism cause any increase (or decrease) in the Earnout
Consideration payable by Acquirer (in general or on any Earnout Payment Date)
and (ii) under no circumstances will Acquirer have any obligation to issue, or
will the holders of Series C-2B Preferred Stock have a right to require
Acquirer to issue (x) as Shortfall Shares any shares of Acquirer Common Stock
other than those available for reallocation by way of reduction of Earnout
Payments to Eligible Effective Time Holders who held Company Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and reallocation thereof as provided
in this Section 5.19(f) or (y) any cash or other consideration in lieu
thereof.

(ii) _Earnout Payments in Acquirer Common Stock following Series C-2B
Liquidation Preference_. Next, the Earnout Consideration shall be paid
(simultaneously pursuant to (A) and (B) below on a pari passu basis, until the
time noted in (A) below): (A) to Eligible Effective Time Holders who held
Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (and which
were not or did not remain Dissenting Shares) in the form of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock valued at the Reference Price _after_  deduction of the
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to the Shortfall Shares (which
deduction shall be borne on a pro rata basis solely by the Eligible Effective
Time Holders who held Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time) until such time as the total number of shares distributed
under this _Section 5.19(f)(ii)_ and _Section 5.19(f)(i)_ , exclusive of any
such shares of Acquirer Common Stock retained by Acquirer for application of
set-off rights pursuant to _Article 8_, is equal to the difference between
(1) the quotient obtained by dividing $92,5000,000 by the Reference Price and
(2) the total number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock issued at the Closing
and (B) to all other Effective Time Holders in cash.

(iii) _Subsequent Earnout Payments_. Thereafter, the Earnout Consideration
shall be paid in cash to Eligible Effective Time Holders until such time, if
ever, as the value of the aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock
issued in the Merger to holder of Company Preferred Stock (other than shares
treated as imputed interest), valued for this purpose based on the mean
between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of Acquirer Common Stock
as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the Closing Date (or if there are no
sales on the Closing Date, then in accordance with the alternative valuation
methodologies

 



79  outlined in Treas. Regs. § 20.2031-2(b)) (the " _Closing Date Price_ ")
would otherwise drop below 40% of the Total Consideration based on the planned
cash payment of Earnout Consideration. For this purpose, " _Total
Consideration_ " shall mean the sum of (i) all Merger Consideration (other
than any Merger Consideration treated as imputed interest and valuing any
shares included in Merger Consideration at the Closing Date Price) paid to
holders of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and (ii) all amounts paid with respect to Dissenting
Shares. In such event, the aggregate portion of each future payment of
Earnout Consideration shall thereafter be 40% in stock (valued for allocation
purposes at the Closing Date Price), or such lesser amount as may be necessary
to maintain at least 40% of Total Consideration to be in the form of Acquirer
Common Stock based on the Closing Date Price. The Agent Expense Amount shall
be treated as cash paid to the Company Stockholders at Closing and included as
Total Consideration (and thus in the denominator for purposes of the
40% calculation described in this _Section 5.19(f)(iii)_). For purposes of
this calculation, any amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares shall be
counted as cash and included in Total Consideration. No fractional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock shall be paid hereunder but instead the number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock shall be determined by rounding up to the
nearest whole number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock. Any such Earnout
Consideration payments made in the form of Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to
this _Section 5.19(f)(iii)_ shall be made solely to Eligible Effective Time
Holders of Company Preferred Stock, with all other Effective Time Holders
entitled to receive only cash with respect to their portion of such payment
of Earnout Consideration. While the value of Acquirer Common Stock for
purposes of the foregoing 40% test shall be deemed to be the Closing Date
Price, the value of such stock for purposes of substituting cash for stock in
any payment of Earnout Consideration shall be the Reference Price.

(iv) _Schedule 5.19(f)_ hereof contains an illustration of such adjustments;
such schedule is inserted for informational purposes only and shall not be
used to interpret, or be deemed relevant to the interpretation, of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Earnout Consideration payable in
shares of Acquirer Common Stock hereunder shall be payable only to Eligible
Effective Time Holders who immediately prior to the Effective Time held
Company Preferred Stock.

 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no case will the
aggregate number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock payable as Earnout
Consideration cause the total number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock
issuable under this Agreement to exceed the maximum number of shares thereof
that can be issued without triggering the need for approval of this Agreement
or the Mergers by Acquirer stockholders pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule
5635(d), and the no shares beyond such maximum number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock shall be issuable under this Agreement under any circumstances.

 

(g) The provisions of Section 5.19(f)(i) specifically designed to benefit the
Eligible Effective Holders who immediately prior to the Effective Time held
shares of Series C-2B Preferred Stock may not be changed in a manner adverse
to such holders with the written consent of holders of a majority of such
holders.

 



80 (h) Acquirer shall pay the Earnout Consideration for each Measurement
Period within fifteen (15) Business Days of the earliest to occur after each
Measurement Period of the Preliminary Resolution Date, the Party Resolution
Date, the Arbitration Resolution Date, or the Accountant Resolution Date.

 

(i) Acquirer, the Company, and the Effective Time Holders agree for all tax
purposes that the right of the Company Stockholders to Earnout Consideration
shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price for the Company
Preferred Stock for purposes of Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provision of foreign, state or local law, as appropriate. A portion of the
Earnout Consideration shall be treated as imputed interest to the extent
required by the Code and regulations thereunder.

 

5.20. _P AY-OFF LETTERS; RELEASES_. Prior to the Closing the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain executed pay-off and lien
release letters (the " _Pay-off Letters_ ") in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Acquirer from Silicon Valley Bank and each other Person to whom the
Company is indebted for borrowed money and to whom it has granted a lien on
any of the Companys assets (all such parties, the " _Company Lenders_ "),
which Pay-off Letters shall include: (i) the balance required to pay-off the
loans made pursuant such Company Lenders loan facility (collectively, the "
_Loans_ ") in full at Closing on the projected Closing Date (including any
prepayment penalties); (ii) the per-diem interest amount that will accrue
from time to time after the projected Closing Date; (iii) a statement that
upon pay-off of the Company Lenders Loan in accordance with its Pay-off
Letter, all related security interests in the Companys assets shall
immediately be released; (iv) attached draft UCC-3 termination statements with
permission for Acquirer to file the UCC-termination statement on behalf of the
Company Lender upon payment and satisfaction of the Loan in accordance with
the relevant Loan Pay-off Letter; (v) wiring instructions for the Company
Lender for delivery of such payment; and (vi) consent to consummation of the
Merger. Except as otherwise contemplated by the Pay-off Letters, the Company
shall take all actions necessary such that all Encumbrances on assets of the
Company shall be released prior to or simultaneously with the Closing.

 

5.21. _S PREADSHEET; COMPANY CLOSING FINANCIAL CERTIFICATE_. The Company
shall prepare and deliver to Acquirer, not later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date, a draft of (i) the Company Closing
Financial Certificate (which certificate shall be accompanied by such
supporting documentation, information and calculations as are necessary for
Acquirer to verify and determine the amounts set forth therein) and (ii) the
Spreadsheet. The draft of the Company Closing Financial Certificate shall set
forth the Companys good faith estimate, as of three (3) Business Days prior
to the expected Closing Date, of items (i) through (iv) set forth in the
definition of "Company Closing Financial Certificate" on Exhibit A hereto.

5.22. _T ERMINATION OF COMPANY OPTIONS_. The Company shall have taken all
necessary actions (under the Company Option Plans or otherwise) to effectuate
the cancellation of each Company Option as contemplated pursuant to Section
1.8(a)(ix) and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, each holder
of a Company Option outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto (other than the rights to receive the consideration described
in Section 1.8(a)(ix), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement)
prior to or as of the Effective Time.

 



81 5.23. _T ERMINATION OF COMPANY WARRANTS_. The Company shall have taken all
commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the cancellation of each Company
Warrant (other than the Excluded Company Warrants) as contemplated pursuant
to Section 1.8(a)(x) and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
each holder of a Company Warrant outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
and as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto (other than the rights of the Excluded Company
Warrantholders to receive the consideration described in Section 1.8(a)(x),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) prior to or as of the
Effective Time.

 

5.24. _T AX-FREE TREATMENT_. Acquirer shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries, including the Merger Subs, to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to constitute a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless the Company (and, after the Closing,
the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent) and Acquirer shall otherwise agree
in writing, none of the parties and none of their Subsidiaries shall take any
action after the Closing Date which action would cause the Mergers,
taken together, to fail to constitute a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)
of the Code.

86 ARTICLE 8

 

ESCROW FUND AND INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1. _I NDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW; SET-OFFS, LIMITATIONS_.

(a) _Indemnity_. The Effective Time Holders who receive or are entitled to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration (collectively, the "Merger
Consideration Recipients") will, subject to the provisions of this _Article
8_, severally (and not jointly) indemnify Acquirer, the Surviving Entity and
each of their directors, officers, employees and agents (each an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") for any loss, cost, claim, damage, liability, Tax or
expense (including enforcement costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
costs) (collectively " _Indemnifiable Damages_ ") related to or arising out of
(i) inaccuracies (as of signing or as of Closing) in any representations and
warranties made by Company in this Agreement (and for this purposes
materiality qualifiers and MAE qualifiers only count for purposes of
determining breach not for purposes of determining Indemnifiable Damages), the
disclosure schedule or any certificate delivered by Company pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant herein by Company, (iii) any
inaccuracies in the Company Closing Financial Certificate or the Spreadsheet,
(iv) any payments made to holders of Dissenting Shares (in excess of the
amount they would have received in accordance with this Agreement with
respect to Dissenting Shares), (v) any claims by Effective Time Holders
related to the Transaction (excluding claims brought by Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent on their behalf), (vi) ****, (vii) any claim by any Company
Warrantholder relating to the cancellation, non-conversion to Merger
Consideration or other treatment (or non-treatment) of such holders Company
Warrant in the Agreement; (viii) Transaction Expenses which are not set forth
in the Company Closing Financial Certificate and taken into account in
computing the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration (" _Indemnifiable Transaction
Expenses_ "); (ix) any Tax resulting from the matter described on _Schedule
8.1(a)(ix)_ to the Companys Disclosure Schedule; (x) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Indemnifiable Damages shall not include any Tax item taken into account in
the calculation of Net Working Capital or Net Cash. Any claim for
indemnification made in accordance with this _Article 8_ (other than any
exercise by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent of its right to
indemnification from the Merger Consideration Recipients pursuant to _Section
8.4(b)_, a " _Claim_."

 

(b) _Escrow; Survival Periods_. Acquirer will withhold the Escrow Amount from
the Adjusted Net Closing Consideration by withholding therefrom (in the
manner and proportions contemplated by _Section 1.8(a)_) the Escrow Amount
and depositing it with the Escrow Agent appointed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (" _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held and administered per this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount will be held in the Escrow Fund
for a period of eighteen (18) months, or such longer period as is reserved to
satisfy Claims made prior to the expiration of such eighteen month period.
Subject to the balance of this Section, the survival period for Claims will be
eighteen (18) months from the Closing, except for claims relating to (A)
breaches of Company representations and warranties with respect to _Section
2.1_ (Organization, Standing, Power and Subsidiaries), _Section 2.2_ (Capital
Structure), _Section 2.3_ (Authority; Non-Contravention), _Section 2.9(a)_
(Title to, Condition and Sufficiency of Assets), _Section 2.12_ (Taxes) and
inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet and (B) fraud, intentional misrepresentation
and intentional or willful breach ((A) and (B) collectively, " _Fundamental
Claims_ " and the representations in (A) and the accuracy of the

_Section 2.10_ (Intellectual Property) (" _IP Claims_ "), (y) claims for
breach of Company representations and warranties with respect to subsections
(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of  _Section 2.13_ (Employee
Benefit Plans), (" _EB Claims_ ") or (z) **** (IP Claims, EB Claims and ****,
collectively, " _Set-off Claims_ "), and to the extent necessary to satisfy
claims that are unsatisfied as of the eighteen month anniversary of Closing.
The survival period for Fundamental Claims shall be the applicable statute of
limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the survival period for Set-off
Claims will be the thirty (30) month anniversary of Closing (****). Claims
for inaccuracies of representations and warranties (other than Fundamental
Claims, Indemnifiable Transaction Expenses, any Claim made under _Section
8.1(a)(ix)_, Claims with respect to ****, Claims with respect to the
representations in _Section 2.4(a)(v)_ (for which purposes Indemnifiable
Damages resulting from breach of the representation in _Section 2.4(a)(v)_
are limited solely to the cost of modifying the Company Financials to the
extent needed to have made such representation correct), which shall be
recoverable from the first dollar without regard to the Deductible) and Set-
off Claims will be subject to a cumulative deductible of $1,250,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") and if the aggregate amount of such Claims exceeds the
Deductible, Acquirer will be indemnified for the amount of such Claims in
excess of the Deductible. The parties acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this _Article 8_ and elsewhere in this Agreement for the assertion
of claims and notices under this Agreement are the result of arms-length
negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be
enforced as agreed by the parties. The parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in this _Article 8_ and elsewhere in the Agreement may
be shorter than otherwise provided by law.

 

(c) _Remedies; Set-off Limitations for Set-off Claims_. Claims (other than
Fundamental Claims and Set-off Claims) may be satisfied solely from the
Escrow Fund. Fundamental Claims may be satisfied from the Escrow Fund, or
(after they have first been sought to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, if
the Escrow Fund is exhausted or fully reserved for disputed claims) by offset
against Earnout Consideration or may be brought directly against the Merger
Consideration Recipients if the Escrow Fund and rights to offset against
Earnout Consideration have been exhausted. Set-off Claims may be satisfied
from the Escrow Fund or (after they have first been sought to be recovered
from the Escrow Fund, if the Escrow Fund is exhausted or fully reserved for
disputed Claims) by offset against Earnout Consideration; provided however
that ****; __and (iii) in each case, (i)-(ii) above, amounts shall be
reimbursed to Acquirer by way of set-off only if and when an Earnout Payment
is made. If, for any reason, amounts from the Escrow Fund are to be
distributed to the Merger Consideration Recipients after Claims have been
offset against Earnout Consideration, then future distributions of amounts
from the Escrow Fund or of Earnout Consideration to Merger Consideration
Recipients shall be allocated such that payment of Claims are charged
first against the Escrow Fund and then against the Earnout Consideration.

(d)****

 

(e) _Pro Rata Satisfaction of Claims_. Claims payable from the Escrow Fund
will be satisfied on the basis of each Merger Consideration Recipients Pro
Rata Escrow Percentage as specified in the Spreadsheet (determined including
any Escrow Amount such Merger Consideration Recipient contributed but
excluding any Dissenting Shares). Claims 

 



88  payable by way of set-off against the Earnout Consideration will be
satisfied based on the Pro Rata Earnout Percentage. Claims payable by way of
recovery directly from Merger Consideration Recipients will be satisfied
based on a pro rata percentage of Merger Consideration received by each Merger
Consideration Recipient, as calculated by Acquirer in consultation with Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent.

 

(f) _Indemnification Cap; Fraud_. The liability of any Merger Consideration
Recipient with regard to Fundamental Claims will be limited to the amount of
Merger Consideration actually received by such Merger Consideration Recipient
as of the time collection of a judgment or award is sought by Acquirer in
accordance with this _Article 8_ or  _Section 9.8_ plus any Merger
Consideration deemed received by virtue of having been contributed to the
Escrow Fund or otherwise payable but for set-off against Earnout
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement or otherwise shall limit the liability of any Person
committing fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional or willful
breach or who was an officer, director or employee of the Company who had
actual knowledge of fraud committed by the Company at the time such fraud
occurred or was committed.

(g) _Tax Impact_. Acquirer, the Company, and the Merger Consideration
Recipients agree for all tax purposes that: (i) the right of the Merger
Consideration Recipients to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price for the Company Stock for purposes of Section 453
of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local law, as
appropriate; (ii) if and to the extent any amount of the Escrow Amount is
actually distributed to the Merger Consideration Recipients, interest may be
imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; (iii)
all interest and earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of the
Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Acquirer; and
(iv) for purposes of calculating the maximum amount of deferred contingent
purchase price under the installment sale rules of Code Section 453, if the
imputed interest amount is less than the amount of interest and earnings on
the Escrow Fund paid to the Merger Consideration Recipients, then an amount
equal to the difference shall be treated as additional interest paid to the
Merger Consideration Recipients.

 

(h) _Insurance Recoveries_. For purposes of this _Article 8_, Indemnifiable
Damages shall be calculated net of actual recoveries under the Companys
insurance policies (with the amount of such recoveries calculated after
deduction of collection costs and premium increases, if any); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Indemnified Person shall be under any obligation to
acquire any insurance policy or pursue or seek any recovery under any
insurance policy.

(i)  _Additional Tax Considerations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no claim for Indemnifiable Damages related to or
arising from (x) the value or condition of any Tax asset of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (y) the ability of Acquirer or its Affiliates to utilize such
Tax asset following the Closing, or (z) any Taxes (or any Indemnifiable
Damages in respect thereof) other than Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period, may
be asserted by Acquirer or claimed by any Indemnified Person as a breach of
any provision of this Agreement or otherwise be a subject of indemnity
hereunder (e.g., the Escrow Fund shall not be available for recovery by, and
the Merger Consideration Recipients shall have no obligation to indemnify or
reimburse, any Indemnified Person for any Taxes due in respect of periods
following the

 



89  Closing due to the unavailability of any net operating losses or other Tax
attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries). All amounts paid pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of this  _Article 8_ shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, be treated as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes.

 

8.2. _C LAIMS_.

 

(a) Claims for indemnification under this _Article 8_ shall be made by
Acquirer by delivering to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent (and to
each Merger Consideration Recipient if it is a Claim brought directly against
the Merger Consideration Recipients) a certificate signed by any officer of
Acquirer (a " _Claim Certificate_ "):

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued, or that it reasonably believes it will incur, pay, reserve or
accrue, Indemnifiable Damages;

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
maximum amount reasonably believed by Acquirer to be incurred, paid, reserved,
accrued or demanded by a third party); and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquirer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

No delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the applicable Claim
survival period shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent
or the Merger Consideration Recipients are materially prejudiced thereby. At
the time of delivery of any Claim Certificate to the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent, if such delivery is on or before the 18 month anniversary
of Closing, a duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate shall be delivered to
the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Person).

 

8.3. _R ESOLUTION OF OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS_.

(a) If the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent does not contest,
by written notice to Acquirer, any Claim or Claims by Acquirer made in any
Claim Certificate within twenty (20) Business Days after any such Claim
Certificate is received by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, then
the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent will be conclusively deemed to
have consented, on behalf of all Merger Consideration Recipients, to the
recovery by the Indemnified Person of the full amount of Indemnifiable Damages
specified in the Claim Certificate, including the forfeiture of such amount
from the Escrow Fund (subject to the terms and conditions in this _Article
8_) having a value sufficient to satisfy such Indemnifiable Damages and,
without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment
for Indemnifiable Damages against the Merger Consideration Recipients for such
amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

 



90 (b) If the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent objects in writing to
any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within such
twenty (20) Business Day period, Acquirer and the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) Business Days
after Acquirers receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection.
If Acquirer and the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall so agree, a
memorandum setting forth their agreement with respect to the resolution of
such Claim shall be prepared and signed by both parties. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and the Escrow
Agent shall distribute such amount from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms of such memorandum.

 

(c) If no such agreement has been reached during the thirty (30) Business Day
period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of
such thirty (30) Business Day period, either Acquirer or the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent may proceed in accordance with the terms set
forth in _Section 9.8_ to resolve the matter. The decision of the J.A.M.S.
arbitrator as to the Company and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate
shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement and the Merger Consideration Recipients and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to conclusively rely and to act in accordance with such decision
and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount from the Escrow Fund in
accordance therewith.

 

(d) For purposes of _Section 8.3(c)_, in any proceeding pursuant to _Section
9.8_, in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim
Certificate is at issue, Acquirer shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing
party unless the arbitrator awards Acquirer more than one-half of the amount
in dispute, in which case the Merger Consideration Recipients shall be deemed
to be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to such arbitration
shall pay its own expenses and the expenses and the fees and expenses of the
prevailing party, including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred in
connection with such arbitration.

8.4. _M ERGER CONSIDERATION RECIPIENTS AGENT_.

(a) At the Closing, Shareholder Representative Services LLC shall be
constituted and appointed as the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration Recipients 
Agent_" shall mean the agent for and on behalf of the Merger Consideration
Recipients to: (i) execute, as Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, this
Agreement and any agreement or instrument entered into or delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) give and receive
notices, instructions, and communications permitted or required under this
Agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument entered into or
executed in connection herewith, for and on behalf of any
Merger Consideration Recipient, to or from Acquirer (on behalf of itself or
any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by each Company Securityholder
individually and not by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent); (iii)
review, negotiate and agree to and authorize deliveries to Acquirer of cash
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Acquirer (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such
claims) pursuant to this _Article 8_; (iv) object to claims pursuant to this
_Article 8_; (v) consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and

 



91  other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the Merger
Consideration Recipients; (vi) consent or agree to any amendment to this
Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement providing
rights or benefits to the Merger Consideration Recipients in accordance with
the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein; (vii) negotiate matters
concerning Earnout Consideration and the calculation thereof with Acquirer;
(viii) review and determine Earnout Consideration and cooperate and work with
Acquirer regarding such review and determination; (ix) enter into agreements,
settlements and compromises regarding the calculation and determination of
Earnout Consideration; and (x) take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or
obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. All such actions
taken by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent within the authority
provided for in this Section 8.4 shall (A) be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside the Agreement and shall be binding on the Merger Consideration
Recipients as a matter of contract law and (B) be binding upon all Merger
Consideration Recipients and their successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by each of them and no Merger Consideration Recipient
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same. Acquirer, Merger Subs and their respective Affiliates (including without
limitation, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity) shall be entitled
to rely on the appointment of Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and treat such Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Merger
Consideration Recipient and has having the duties, power and authority
provided for in this _Section 8.4_. The Merger Consideration Recipients shall
be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent in connection with this _Article 8_, and
Acquirer and other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively
on any action or decision of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent. The
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent may resign at any time, provided that
(i) it must give thirty (30) days advance notice to Acquirer and the Advisory
Group and (ii) the Advisory Group shall appoint a new party reasonably
acceptable to Acquirer as Merger Consideration Recipients Agent within ten
(10) Business Days or such longer period as Acquirer agrees.

 

(b) The Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall not be liable to any
Merger Consideration Recipient for any act done or omitted hereunder as the
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent while acting in good faith (and any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence
of such good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. In
addition, certain Company Securityholders (the " _Advisory Group_ ") and the
Company will enter into a letter agreement with the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent providing, among other things, that the Advisory Group
shall have the opportunity to advise the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent on matters of material interest to the Merger Consideration Recipients.
The Merger Consideration Recipients acknowledge the advisory role of the
Advisory Group and agree that the Advisory Group shall not be liable to the
Merger Consideration Recipients for any liability incurred by the members of
the Advisory Group while acting in good faith and arising out of or in
connection with the exercise of their advisory role (it being understood that
any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith), even if such act or omission constitutes
negligence on the part of the Advisory Group or one of its members. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent (i) shall not be subject to any implied duties, and (ii) shall not be
required to take any action that, in the 

 



92  opinion of its counsel, reasonably could be expected to expose the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent to liability or that is contrary to law. All
expenses of Merger Consideration Recipients Agent in excess of amounts
available to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent from the Agent Expense
Amount to cover Merger Consideration Recipients Agent Expenses (as defined
below) shall be borne by the Merger Consideration Recipients, but in any
event, in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration
actually received by each Merger Consideration Recipient. The Merger
Consideration Recipients shall severally (based on their respective pro rata
percentage of Merger Consideration received by each Merger Consideration
Recipient) indemnify the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and hold it
harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder, including all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration
Recipients  Agent Expenses_"), in each case as such Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent Expenses are suffered or incurred, but in any event, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration actually
received by each Merger Consideration Recipient. In the event that any such
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent Expense is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent will reimburse the Merger Consideration Recipients the
amount of such indemnified Merger Consideration Recipients Agent Expense to
the extent attributable to such gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith. If not paid directly to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent by
the Merger Consideration Recipients, any such Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent Expenses may be recovered by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent
from (i) the funds in the Agent Expense Amount (as described below), (ii) or
the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Merger Consideration Recipients (as
described below) and (iii) from any Earnout Consideration at such time as any
such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Merger Consideration
Recipients; provided, that while this section allows the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent to be paid from the Agent Expense Amount, the Escrow Fund
and the Earnout Consideration, this does not relieve the Merger Consideration
Recipients from their obligation to promptly pay such Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Merger
Consideration Recipients or otherwise. At the Effective Time, Acquirer will
deposit the Agent Expense Amount with the Escrow Agent to be governed by the
provisions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The Agent Expense
Amount and, subject to  _Section 8.4(c)_ below, the Escrow Fund, will be
available to indemnify the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent against any
liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent without gross negligence, willful misconduct
or bad faith on the part of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties under this Agreement. For tax purposes the parties shall treat the
Agent Expense Amount as having been received by the Merger Consideration
Recipients at the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration Recipients shall be
treated as the owners of the Agent Expense Amount and shall report any income
earned on the Agent Expense Amount.

 



93 (c) The Merger Consideration Recipients Agent will be entitled to
recover Merger Consideration Recipients Agent Expenses from the Escrow Agent
out of the Agent Expense Amount, without the requirement of any consent or
approval by Acquirer, upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, from time to time, of
an itemized list of expenses incurred by the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent in connection with the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent duties
under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall reimburse the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent for Merger Consideration Recipients Agent
Expenses, upon the request of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, from
(i) at any time, the Agent Expense Amount or from any interest accruing on the
Agent Expense Amount (the " _Agent Expense Funds_ ") or (ii) from any Escrow
Fund available for distribution to the Merger Consideration Recipients (the "
_Escrow Fund Distributions_ ") at the time such Escrow Fund amounts, if any,
otherwise would be distributed to the Merger Consideration Recipients after
the applicable Escrow Release Date (and after final resolution of any pending
but unresolved claims for indemnification that are not awarded to Acquirer
upon the resolution of such claims in accordance with this _Article 8_). In
addition to reimbursement for Agent Merger Consideration Recipients Agent
Expenses then incurred to date, the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent may
request that the Escrow Agent reserve from time to time out of the Agent
Expense Funds or any Escrow Fund Distributions an amount reasonably calculated
by the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent to cover reasonably anticipated
Merger Consideration Recipients Agent Expenses. The Agent Expense Funds
shall not be available to Acquirer to cover Indemnifiable Damages and no
portion of the Agent Expense Funds shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund.
Any remaining amounts in the Agent Expense Funds, including any interest on
the Agent Expense Amount shall, subject to this _Section 8.4_, be paid to the
Merger Consideration Recipients pro rata at such time as the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent so directs the Escrow Agent to make such
distribution.

(d) After the Closing, any notice or communication given or received by, and
any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent that is within the scope of the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agents authority under _Section 8.4(a)_ shall
constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of all the Merger Consideration Recipients and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Merger Consideration
Recipient; and each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such
Effective Time Holder. Acquirer, the other Indemnified Persons are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act
within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution
or instruction of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent. All of the
indemnification obligations of the Merger Consideration Recipients under this
_Section 8.4_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(e) In the event Acquirer becomes aware of a third-party claim which Acquirer
in good faith believes may result in a claim for indemnification under this
_Article 8_ by

 



94  or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, Acquirer shall have the right to
conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the costs
and expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with such defense, settlement
or resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and
experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the
Indemnifiable Damages for which Acquirer may seek indemnification pursuant to
a claim made hereunder). The Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall have
the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with
respect to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents
does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person and shall be
entitled, at the expense of the Merger Consideration Recipients, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of the third-
party claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the third-party claim.
However, except with the consent of the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given unless the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent shall have objected within fifteen (15)
Business Days after a written request for such consent by Acquirer, no
settlement or resolution by Acquirer of any claim that gives rise to a claim
against the Escrow Fund by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person shall be
determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages relating
to such matter; and further, settlements of **** Claims for which
indemnification is sought under this _Article 8_ may be effected only with
the consent of the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent, which will not
unreasonably be withheld conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to
have been given unless the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall have
objected within fifteen (15) Business Days after a written request for such
consent by Acquirer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Merger Consideration Recipients Agents authority to consent to
settlement or resolution by Acquirer of any such claims exists only to the
extent of the amount of the Escrow Fund and shall not extend beyond the Escrow
Fund. In the event that the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent has
consented to any such settlement or resolution, neither the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent nor any Merger Consideration Recipient shall
have any power or authority to object under this _Article 8_ to the amount
of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund
for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution.

 

8.5. _E XCLUSIVE REMEDY_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
in the event that the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this
Article 8 shall be the Indemnified Persons sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement or any claims relating to this Agreement or any other document,
certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto, except in connection with
(a) pursuing remedies under applicable Legal Requirements for fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional or willful breach, (b) any
nonsolicitation or employment agreement contemplated by this Agreement, or (c)
bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable relief. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, and agrees to cause
its Affiliates to waive, any and all rights, claims and causes of action they
may have against any other Party or any Affiliate thereof arising under or
based upon any statutory or common law (except as expressly stated herein).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that
any party shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any other
Person under this Agreement, such obligation shall not include any obligation
to indemnify any consequential, special, punitive, incidental or indirect
damages whatsoever, including if such damages in any way arise out of, relate
to or are a consequence of the

 



95  performance or nonperformance by such party under this Agreement (including
with respect to loss of profits, goodwill, business interruptions, anticipated
savings or claims of customers), even if advised of the possibility of such
damages; _provided however_ , that this limitation shall not prevent Acquirer
(or the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent pursuant to Section 8.4(b))
from being indemnified for recovery of any portion of an indemnifiable third
party claim that consists of consequential, special, punitive, incidental or
indirect damages awarded to such third party in a court or arbitration
proceeding.

Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the
exhibits attached hereto, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and

9.5.  _A SSIGNMENT_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such

law. Subject to the Reviewing Accountant procedure specified in Section
5.19(e), any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or Company
thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Santa Clara
County, California before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be
administered by J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its successor (" _J.A.M.S._ ") pursuant
to J.A.M.S. Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the
Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not
preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from
a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties agree that any dispute and
arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.,
Section 1 et seq. Subject to the satisfaction or mutual waiver of provision
in this Agreement requiring good faith consultation concerning resolution of
particular disputes, either Acquirer or the Merger Consideration Recipients
Agent may commence the arbitration process called for by this Agreement by
filing a written demand for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and giving a copy of
such demand to each of the other parties to this Agreement. The single
arbitrator shall be mutually agreed on by Acquirer and the Merger
Consideration Recipients Agent and selected from J.A.M.S.s panel of
neutrals. If the parties cannot mutually agree within thirty (30) days of the
filing of an arbitration demand, the parties agree that an arbitrator may be
appointed in accord with the applicable J.A.M.S. rules and procedures then in
place relating to the

 



98  appointment of an arbitrator by J.A.M.S. The parties will cooperate with
J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly selecting the arbitrator from
J.A.M.S.s panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings
in order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and intent of this Agreement. The
parties covenant that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith,
and that the parties to the arbitration will bear the expense of deposits and
advances required by the arbitrator in equal proportions (provided, that any
such expenses attributable to the Merger Consideration Recipients Agent shall
be borne by the Merger Consideration Recipients). Upon the conclusion of any
arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact
and conclusions of law and a final written arbitration award setting forth the
basis and reasons for any decision reached (the " _Final Award_ ") and will
promptly deliver such documents to Escrow Agent, the Merger Consideration
Recipients Agent and Acquirer, together with a copy of the Final Award signed
by the arbitrator. The provisions of this Section 9.8 may be enforced by any
court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement will be
entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys
fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered. Judgment
upon the Final Award may be entered in any court having competent
jurisdiction. If for any reason J.A.M.S. or its successor no longer is in
business, then the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.

9.9. _W AIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.10.  _R ULES OF CONSTRUCTION_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.
