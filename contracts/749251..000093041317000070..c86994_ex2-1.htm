2017, among GARTNER, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ "), COBRA
ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and CEB INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors of
Parent, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement,
determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and their respective
stockholders and declared the advisability of this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub have recommended adoption of this Agreement by their respective
stockholders, as applicable;

  



  

Whereas concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the persons listed
on _Schedule I_ (the " _Stockholders_ ") are entering into a voting agreement
with Parent pursuant to which, among other actions and matters, each of the
Stockholders has agreed to vote all shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by such Stockholder in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

 _The Merger_

  



  

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, 1301 Avenue of
the Americas, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a
date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than
the second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VII

   


--- 

  

--- 

    

shall not continue to have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived on such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the
first Business Day thereafter on which all such conditions shall have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing between the Company and Parent; _provided further_ , that if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
the Closing shall not occur until the earlier to occur of (a) a date during
the Marketing Period specified by Parent on three Business Days' written
notice to the Company (it being understood that such date may be conditioned
upon the simultaneous completion of the Debt Financing and, if the Debt
Financing is not completed for any reason at such time, such notice shall
automatically be deemed withdrawn) and (b) the second Business Day following
the final day of the Marketing Period or, if the final day of the Marketing
Period is within two Business Days prior to the End Date, then on the End
Date (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VII for the Closing as of the date determined
pursuant to this proviso), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and
Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.04. _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that the
name of the Surviving Company shall be CEB Inc. and the certificate of
incorporation shall comply with Section 6.05. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company and the bylaws
shall comply with Section 6.05.

Section 1.06. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

Article II

  



  

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

  



  

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or Merger Sub Common Stock:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and
each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (x) 0.2284 of a fully
paid and nonassessable share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (y) $54.00 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest.

   

-3- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Common Stock_ " means the common
stock, par value $0.0005 per share, of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall irrevocably
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration and (ii) cash sufficient to (x) pay
the Cash Consideration and (y) make payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such Parent Common Stock and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  



  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify subject to the Company's reasonable approval), together with
instructions thereto.

  



  

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon
(i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent,
in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f)
and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant

   

-4- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is
held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have
been paid, as well as any other requirements reasonably imposed by
the Exchange Agent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect
thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock were
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect
of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

  



  

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment with respect to the Cash
Consideration or in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder, until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form), there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  



  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  



  

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Common

--- 

    

Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by
the average, rounded down to the nearest cent, of the closing sale prices of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as
reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) for
the ten (10) trading days immediately prior to the date of the Effective
Time.

  



  

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 360 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common
Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, in each case without any
interest thereon.

  



  

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for five years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment by the
Exchange Agent of the Cash Consideration portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this Article II and Parent shall
promptly replace any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent lost through any
investment made pursuant to this Section 2.02(i). No investment by the
Exchange Agent of the Cash Consideration portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
additional cash or additional shares of Parent Common Stock to pay (i) the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and (iii) any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(d), in each case, without interest.

  



  

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld shall be timely paid over to the

--- 

  

--- 

    

appropriate Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

  



  

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the
Stock Consideration and pay the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on such Certificate, in
each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.03. _Dissenters ' Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights in
respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such
shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c) and instead shall be entitled to such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall
have failed to timely perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost,
such stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL) and to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If
any stockholder holding Dissenting Shares shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right with respect to his, her
or its Dissenting Shares, such stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such Dissenting Share, in accordance with Section
2.01(c). The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any notice or
demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock or
any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and (ii) give Parent
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands and shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.04. _Tax Treatment_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
exchange of Company Common Stock for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger is intended to constitute a
taxable sale or exchange of such Company Common Stock for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Parent
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations,

not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent

as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent By-laws_ ") and (b) the
constituent documents of Merger Sub. Parent has not taken any action in
breach or violation of any of the provisions of the Parent Certificate or
Parent By-laws and no Parent Subsidiary is in breach or violation of any of
the provisions of its respective certificates of incorporation, by-laws or
comparable governing documents, except, in the case of a Parent Subsidiary,

under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all
such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to

required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

Section 3.12. _Financing  _. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true,
complete and correct copy of the executed commitment letter, dated as of
January 5, 2017, among the Commitment Parties and Parent (as it may be
amended, modified or replaced in accordance with Section 6.09, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, the Commitment Parties have committed to lend
the amounts and arrange the financing set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except for fee letters and the engagement letter relating
to the Debt Financing (collectively, the " _Fee Letters_ "), true, complete
and correct copies of which have been provided to the Company with only fee
amounts and certain economic terms (none of which would adversely affect the
amount (other than in respect of upfront fees) or availability of the Debt
Financing if so exercised by the Commitment Parties party thereto) redacted,
as of the date hereof, there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements to which Parent is a party relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing or any portion
thereof on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter have not been amended, restated, waived
or modified and no such amendment, restatement, waiver or modification is

force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, the

Commitment Parties. Other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
there are no conditions precedent (including any "flex" provisions), to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing,
or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing
Date. All commitments and other fees required to be paid under the Debt
Commitment Letter prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid in full.

  



  

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 4.03, clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.06, and Section 4.14

disbursed pursuant to the definitive agreements contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, in the aggregate and together with the available cash,

Cash Consideration and all fees and expenses to be paid by Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

looking information, as well as certain business plans and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses and operations, that were provided to Parent and Merger Sub in good
faith, and Parent and Merger Sub are making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-related
plan information, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon or will

statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed and publicly available after January

Company SEC Documents in any risk factors section, in any section related to
forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "). The Company Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article IV, and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this
Article IV to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other sections.

  



  

Section 4.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and
each of the Company's Subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority
and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have
such power or authority or to possess Company Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent, prior to
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the by-laws of the
Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company By-laws_
"). The Company has not taken any action in breach or violation of any of the
provisions of the Company Charter or the Company By-laws, and no Company
Subsidiary is in breach or violation of any of the provisions of its
respective certificates of incorporation, by-laws or comparable governing
documents, except, in the case of a Company Subsidiary, for breaches or
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

material respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the

not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such
filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of
the Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it
was filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief
financial officer of the Company (or each former chief executive officer of

"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

  



  

(e) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)

reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
Company SEC Documents.

Section 5.02. _Transaction Solicitation Period_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 9, 2017 (the " _Transaction
Solicitation Period_ "), the Company may, directly or indirectly, including
with the assistance of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
Representatives of the Company, (i) actively seek and take any action to
initiate,

   

-44- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate (whether publicly or otherwise)
any Takeover Proposal, and (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or
continue any discussions or negotiations relating to, or that may be expected
to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, and in connection with such efforts, the
Company may authorize its or any of its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
employees, agents or other Representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by the Company or by any of the Subsidiaries
of the Company), directly or indirectly, to initiate, solicit, encourage or
otherwise facilitate (whether publicly or privately) efforts by any Person or
group (each a " _Prospective Acquirer_ ") to decide whether to make a
Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(b) During the Transaction Solicitation Period, the Company may provide
non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to
Prospective Acquirers, but the Company will not provide, or authorize anyone
to provide, non-public information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a Prospective Acquirer unless the Prospective Acquirer enters
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company not less restrictive of the
Prospective Acquirer than the Confidentiality Agreement, except that the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Prospective Acquirer
need not prohibit the making of a non-public Takeover Proposal to the
Company Board. If the Company provides to any Prospective Acquirer non-public
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company has
not provided to Parent, the Company will promptly provide that non-public
information to Parent, except to the extent providing Parent with such
information is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) If at any time during the Transaction Solicitation Period the Company
Board is presented with or receives a bona fide, written or oral
Takeover Proposal from a Prospective Acquirer, then the Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 48 hours of the receipt thereof, advise
Parent in writing of such Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions
of such Takeover Proposal (including any material amendments thereto) and the
identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that
it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality or other agreement subsequent to the date hereof that
prohibits the Company from complying with this Section 5.02(c).

  



  

Section 5.03. _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) After the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period, except, in each
case, with respect to an Excluded Party, the Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or instruct any of its Subsidiaries or any of its and their
respective directors, officers or employees or any of their respective
investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors, agents or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or
indirectly solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate
any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding,
or knowingly furnish to any Person any non-public or confidential information
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
except, in each case, with respect to an Excluded Party, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a

   

-45- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the end of the Transaction
Solicitation Period and was made after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.03(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with
Section 5.03(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives and any financing sources) ( _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
Person, except to the extent providing Parent with such information is
prohibited by applicable Law) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (or with one or more
of its financing sources) not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that the confidentiality agreement between
the Company and such Prospective Acquirer need not prohibit the making of a
non-public Takeover Proposal to the Company Board), and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Takeover Proposal and the negotiation
of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and such Person's Representatives and any financing sources). For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the end of the Transaction Solicitation
Period, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in this
Section 5.03(a) with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to
any amended proposal submitted by any Excluded Party, so long as such Person
continues to be an Excluded Party. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.03(a) by any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by the
Company.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse
to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse
to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or
(B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action in this
clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval:

  



  

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the
Company Board determines in good faith

   

-46- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

(after consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law if and only if:

  



  

(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has
(i) so determined; and (ii) resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 5.03(b), which notice will describe the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

  



  

(B) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such three Business Day period,
have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent has requested to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer
determines in good faith that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; or

  



  

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor) is a Superior Proposal,
then the Company Board may (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if
and only if:

  



  

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;

  



  

(B) the Company has complied with its obligations in all material
respects pursuant to this Section 5.03 with respect to such Takeover
Proposal; and

  



  

(C) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") to the effect
that the Company Board has (A) received a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.03, which notice will describe the basis for such Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or
"group" of Persons making such Takeover Proposal, the material terms of such
Takeover Proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to such
Takeover Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent has requested to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; it being
understood that (a) in the event of any material revisions to such Takeover
Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.03 with respect
to such new written notice,

   

-47- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

except that with respect to a Takeover Proposal made by an Excluded Party,
references to three (3) Business Days in this Section 5.03(b) shall be deemed
to be two (2) Business Days from and after the second time such a notice is
given and (b) the Company Board, at the end of the Notice Period (after
consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor), must
have in good faith reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written
Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 5.03, following the end of the
Transaction Solicitation Period the Company shall promptly, and in any event
within 48 hours of the receipt thereof, advise Parent in writing of any
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person
making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed
in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of the status and
details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Takeover Proposal,
and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged
between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any Person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company
from (w) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act, (x) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with
outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law,(y) in response to an inquiry, responding to
inform any Person solely of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.03 or (z) making any "stop, look and listen" statement pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. The making of a disclosure permitted
under this Section 5.03(d) shall not be, in itself, a breach of this Section
5.03; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Takeover Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement has not changed; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action, or make any statement,
that would violate this Section 5.03.

fifth (35th) calendar day following the end of the Transaction Solicitation

Person shall continue to be an Excluded Party until the fifth (5th) calendar
day following the day, if applicable, on which Parent has most recently
delivered a revised proposal or offer with respect to which such Excluded
Party has not, within such 5-day period, delivered a new or amended written
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company's outside counsel and financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being agreed that for purposes of this
clause (ii), the reference to "Merger" in the definition of Superior Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to the Merger as modified by such revised
proposal or offer from Parent, and it further being agreed that any amended or

deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an expiration, termination or
withdrawal of such previously submitted Takeover Proposal).

circumstance, condition, event or occurrence that (i) as of the date of this

counsel and financial advisor) (A) to be superior from a financial point of
view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement),
and (B) that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal, financing conditionality or financing
contingency and other aspects of such proposal.

Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and cause the foregoing to be filed

SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement

of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the
other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Each of the Company and Parent shall advise the other, promptly
after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the
Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension
of the qualification of the Stock Consideration for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best

(b) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to

supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in

and Section 5.03(d), solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Company Stockholder Approval and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company
Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
5.03(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01(d), if
on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, (i) the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, (ii) after consultation between the
Company and Parent, the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation
of applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement or (iii) Parent otherwise provides written
consent to such postponements or adjournments, the Company shall make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, _provided_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which
the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company agrees
that its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or

advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the

directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors' and
officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending
December 31, 2015 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.05 it shall

of each policy year within such period.

Company Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal counsel, financial
advisors, independent auditors, and other advisors and representatives to
cooperate in the defense against such litigation.

  



  

Section 6.08. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause (a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and (b) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who
may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.09. _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on a timely basis on the terms
and subject to the conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letters (including the "flex" provisions) to the extent the proceeds
thereof are needed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations and
conditions thereunder, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements on
a timely basis with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions (including "flex" provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter or otherwise no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (iii) satisfy (or
have waived) on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to
Parent in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within its control at or prior
to the Closing (including the payment of any commitment, engagement or
placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing), and otherwise
comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the Financing Agreements), (iv) enforce all its respective
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (v) except to the extent
Parent otherwise has cash resources at Closing to fund its payment
obligations in full hereunder, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter (or waiver thereof), consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent shall not permit any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver by Parent of any
provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing
Agreement if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver expands on the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the "Closing Date" of
the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Parent may replace, amend,
supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add agents, co-agents,
lenders, arrangers, joint bookrunners, managers or other entities that have
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof in

   

-61- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

accordance with the provisions therein. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of any such replacement, amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver. For purposes of this Section 6.09,
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 6.09 and references to "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or
substituted by this Section 6.09.

  



  

(b) In the event any funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof, become
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the "flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letters) or the
Financing Agreements, Parent shall (a) give prompt notice to the Company and
(b) use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and subject to conditions that are
not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions set
forth in the Fee Letters) as in effect on the date hereof, in an amount
sufficient, when combined with cash on hand and borrowings under any existing
credit facilities or other financing arrangements, to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall have the right from
time to time to substitute other committed debt financing or the proceeds of
consummated debt or equity transactions, or available cash or cash
equivalents, for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same
and/or any alternative financing source; provided, that, in the case of
committed debt financing, any such substitution shall not expand upon in any
material respect the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on
the "Closing Date" of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the "flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letters) as in
effect on the date of this Agreement in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such event, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the new
commitment letter (the " _New Debt Financing Commitment_ "), if any, entered
into in accordance with this Section 6.09(b) (any financing arranged under
this Section 6.09(b) to substitute for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing or if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable shall be
referred to as the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "). Parent will provide the
Company with a true, complete and correct copy of any New Debt Financing
Commitment obtained by Parent in connection with an Alternate Debt Financing
promptly following the execution thereof (other than fees and other
information redacted from such agreements that is consistent with the
information redacted from the Fee Letters as permitted by Section 3.12(a)).
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing or the Alternate Debt
Financing, as applicable, is available and the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature will be satisfied (or waived) at
the Closing, subject to satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
within its control necessary to incur the Indebtedness provided under the
Debt Financing or the Alternate Debt Financing, as applicable, to consummate
the Merger, to the extent the proceeds thereof are needed to consummate the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.09(b) shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require,
Parent to (i) bring any enforcement action, including commencing or filing any
Legal Proceeding, against any Debt Financing Source to enforce its

   

-62- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of
any conditions contained therein or otherwise); provided, that Parent shall
pay all fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter as they become due.

  



  

(c) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing (or replacement thereof) as the Company may reasonably
request, and shall provide the Company with true and complete copies of all
Financing Agreements entered into prior to the Closing Date and, as the
Company may reasonably request from time to time, drafts of such documents
posted to a lender syndicate group; provided that the Fee Letters may be
redacted in accordance with Section 6.09(a); provided, further, that in no
event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach or default by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements of which
Parent becomes aware.

  



  

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any Alternate Debt Financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt
Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing.

  



  

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to
Parent, on a reasonably timely basis, all cooperation and assistance as
may be reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection with
the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Debt Financing and
repayment of Existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i) provide reasonable
cooperation with the marketing efforts of Parent and lenders or initial
purchasers for any of the Debt Financing, including using reasonable best
efforts, upon reasonable advance notice, to cause its Representatives

Subsidiaries) to be available to participate in a reasonable number

reasonably timely fashion of all financial statements and other customary
data to be included in connection therewith (including all audited financial
statements and unaudited financial statements (which shall have been reviewed
by the independent accountants for the Company as provided in the procedures
specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722) referred
to in clause 4 of Exhibit H to the Debt Commitment Letter), information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required for Parent to
prepare pro forma financial statements as contemplated in clause 6 of Exhibit
H to the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that the Company need
only assist in the preparation thereof, but shall not be required to prepare
independently any separate pro forma financial statements), financial data,
audit reports and other information regarding the Company and its

required by Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, information regarding
executive compensation (including under Rule 402(b) of Regulation S-K)
and (B) for the syndication of bridge loan commitments and facilities and

secure the Debt Financing, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company's independent auditors to provide, consistent with customary
practice, (A) consent to offering memoranda that include or incorporate the

and customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) with
respect to financial information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (B) reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma
financial statements by Parent and (C) reasonable assistance and cooperation
to Parent, including attending the accounting due diligence sessions of the

their reasonably requested due diligence, (vii) furnish Parent and the Debt

as suitable to be made available to lenders who do not wish to receive
material non-public information, (ix) arrange for customary payoff letters,

terminated on the Closing Date (subject to receipt from Parent of the funds
necessary to effectuate the pay-off contemplated by such payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge), and, if requested by Parent,
arranging for redemption notices for Existing Indebtedness to be given at
Closing or prior to Closing and conditional on the occurrence of the Closing,

-64- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing
Agreement to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the
cooperation of or is within the control of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the syndication or marketing of the Debt
Financing, provided that such logos are not used in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to harm, disparage or adversely affect the Company, its
Subsidiaries, their marks or their reputation.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives

other fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liabilities that are
not reimbursed by Parent as provided in Section 6.09(g) below or give any

this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

  



  

Section 6.11. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.12. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of not less than the
period of time from the Closing Date through January 1 of the year following
the year in which the Closing Date occurs,, the employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive base
compensation and incentive opportunities (including, for this purpose, the
calendar 2017 bonus opportunities) that are no less favorable than the base
compensation and incentive opportunities provided to such employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
and benefits that are substantially as favorable in the aggregate as either
the benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time or to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
In providing for incentive compensation opportunities for the Continuing
Employees for calendar year 2017, Parent shall seek to ensure that such
opportunities reasonably take into account the pre-Closing performance and
targets, as well as the impact of the transition after the Closing, in order
to be fair to the Continuing Employees.

  



  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries (" _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") which are made

early retirement subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan) and
vesting, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, treat
service recognized by the Company and any Company Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time as service with Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding that the Company service shall
be recognized by Parent Benefit Plans in accordance with the forgoing, the
date of initial participation of each Continuing Employee in any
Parent Benefit Plan shall be no earlier than the Effective Time; further
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to

   

-66- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

the extent that (i) such Parent benefit plan does not recognize service with
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries of similarly situated employees of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or (ii) such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the scope of Section 9.07, nothing in this Section
6.12 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any
Continuing Employee or any other person (other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns), including any rights to continued
employment, the terms and conditions of the employment, or to any specific
benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement.

  



  

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary made available to Continuing Employees after the Effective
Time, Parent or such Parent Subsidiary shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the analogous welfare plans of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket maximums
incurred prior to the Effective Time and during the portion of the plan year

Time and as set forth on Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or
in combination with any other event), pursuant to the terms thereof,
including respecting any limitations as to amendment or modification included
in such agreements.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.12, Parent shall assume,
honor and continue, or shall cause to be assumed, honored and continued, for
the benefit of all Continuing Employees, (i) the Company's Severance Program--
U.S. Staff for a period of not less than 12 months following the Effective
Time and (ii) the Company's paid time off policy through the later to occur of
(x) the end of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs or (y)
December 31, 2017. Parent shall continue, or shall cause to be continued, the
Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, As Amended, Effective January 1, 2015
(the " _Company NQDC Plan_ ") until such time as account balances of current
participants are distributed in accordance with deferral elections in effect
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
have the ability to amend other terms of the Company NQDC Plan, including
limiting ability to make additional deferrals, changing the plan administrator
and changing deemed investment alternatives, and _provided further_ that
nothing herein shall preclude Parent from terminating the Company NQDC Plan
in the event of a change of control of Parent. The Company NQDC Plan grantor
trust holds assets that are substantially equal to the benefit obligations
under the Company NQDC Plan (exclusive of liabilities for Company RSUs
deferred under the Company NQDC Plan) as of the date of this Agreement, and
all such assets will be

   

-67- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

available to Parent after the Effective Time to fund the obligation to pay
benefits under the terms of the Company NQDC Plan. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 6.12, Parent shall retain discretion to
terminate or amend the Company's Retiree Medical Policy in accordance
with its terms, although benefits for former employees participating in the
plan will be grandfathered in the event of any termination or amendment of
the Retiree Medical Policy.

  



  

(g) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to constitute an amendment to any Parent Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefits plan maintained
for or provided to employees, directors or consultants of Parent or the
Company prior to or following the Effective Time, or, except as otherwise set
forth in this Section 6.12, to prohibit or limit the ability of Parent to
amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements of Parent or the Company.

  



  

(h) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that, for purposes of each
Company Benefit Plan, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or "corporate
change," as applicable.

  



  

Section 6.13. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the other party's operations prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.14. _401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the day prior to the Effective
Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary shall adopt written resolutions of the appropriate board of
directors to effect the termination of any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). The Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated
pursuant to an action by the Company Board or the board of directors of a
Subsidiary, as applicable. In the event of such termination of the Company
401(k) Plan, Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee who was
participating in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date of its termination,
the right to participate, as soon as administratively practicable following
the Effective Time, in a replacement plan sponsored by Parent or its
Subsidiaries intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), and Parent
shall take all actions necessary to permit the rollover of account
balances (including outstanding loans) of such Continuing Employees from the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, at the participants' election,
_provided_ that accepting such rollovers would not jeopardize the tax-
qualified status of the Parent 401(k) Plan.

Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if

(ii) if the condition set forth in Section 7.01(e) is not satisfied and

the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) is
not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days
after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (B) two

Stockholder Approval if (i) the Company has received a Superior Proposal; and
(ii) the Company Board has authorized the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate the Takeover
Proposal contemplated by that Superior Proposal and the Company pays

shall relieve any party from any liability for any statement, act or failure

misrepresentation or a breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement; and (b) the parties acknowledge and agree that no such
termination shall relieve a party from any liability for its failure to
consummate the Merger when required in accordance with this Agreement after
the conditions precedent to such party's obligations to effect the Closing set

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which

consummate the Merger). The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders,
and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company unless required by
Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing sentence, this
Section 8.03 and Sections 9.07, 9.08, 9.09, 9.11 and 9.12 may not be amended

in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No

stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required by Law. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  



  

Section 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of Parent
or the stockholders of the Company.
