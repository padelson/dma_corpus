shall be One Hundred and Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($125,000,000) (the "
_Base Price_ ") reduced by the amount of the Returns Reserve, increased or

Price_ ") and increased by the amount of any Additional Purchase Price payable
pursuant to Section 3.5.

   

       



  |  

Section 3.2

  |  

_Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be paid as follows: 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Upon signing of this Agreement, the Purchasers shall pay to Coty
for the account of the Sellers as their respective interests may appear, a
commitment fee of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Commitment Fee_ "), provided that (i) in the event the Closing has not
occurred by 11:59 PM EST on January 31, 2007, and (ii) the Sellers have as of
such date satisfied all closing conditions to be satisfied by them (including
without limitation the delivery of the Consent and Amendment Agreement signed
by all necessary parties other than the Purchasers), then the Commitment Fee
shall be increased in amount to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in the
aggregate and the Purchasers shall pay the balance thereof to Coty for the
account of the Purchasers in immediately available funds on or before
February 1, 2007. The Commitment Fee shall be credited against the Closing
Payment pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or, in the event the Closing has not
occurred by the Termination Date, retained by Sellers or refunded to
Purchasers as provided in Section 7.7.

  

(b) At Closing, the Purchasers shall pay Coty in immediately
available US funds, for the account of the Sellers as their respective
interests may appear, the sum of Ninety-Five Million Dollars ($95,000,000)
(the " _Closing Payment_ "). The Commitment Fee shall be credited to and
applied against the Closing Payment and the net amount shall be paid by bank
wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to such account as Coty shall,
not less than two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, designate in writing to
Ascendia.

  

(c) In the event Section 3.3(c) is applicable, either the Sellers or
the Purchasers, as the case may be, shall pay to the other the amount
determined in accordance with Section 3.

  

(d) On the thirtieth (30th) day following the Closing Date, (i) the
Purchaser Guarantor shall issue to Coty a number of shares of the common
stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Parent Guarantor (" _Ascendia Brands
Common Stoc_ k"), determined by dividing Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) by
the higher of (x) a factor equal to ninety five percent (95%) of the average
closing price of Ascendia Brands Common Stock on the thirty (30) trading days
immediately following the issuance date of the first public announcement of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) $1.00;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the minimum number of shares of Ascendia Brands
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) shall be five
million (5,000,000) and (ii) the Parent Guarantor and Coty

  



       
  

shall execute and deliver a registration rights agreement (the " _Registration
Rights Agreement_ ") and a lock-up agreement (the " _Lock-Up Agreement_ ")
with respect to such shares of Ascendia Brands Common Stock, such agreements
to be substantially in the forms of **Exhibit I** and **Exhibit J** ,
respectively.

  

(e) $20,000,000 of the Purchase Price shall be evidenced by, and paid
in accordance with the terms of, a promissory note, substantially in the form
of **Exhibit K** (the " _Note_ ").

   

       



  |  

Section 3.3

  |  

_Inventory Adjustment_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) As soon as practicable after Closing, but in any event not later
than thirty (30) days thereafter, the parties shall jointly conduct a physical
count (or a cycle count if so agreed by the parties and acceptable to the
Purchasers auditors) of the Brand Inventory. Based upon such physical count
(or cycle count, as the case may be) and the Reserve Certification furnished
by the Sellers at Closing pursuant to Section 7.4(m), the parties shall
calculate the net book value of the Brand Inventory (the " _Closing Inventory
Value_ "). Each party shall make available to the other party upon request
copies of the work papers used in its calculations.

  

(b) In the event of any difference in the parties calculations of
the Closing Inventory Value, the parties shall attempt in good faith to
reconcile such differences. If such differences remain unreconciled after ten
(10) days, the parties shall submit a statement of all unresolved differences
together with copies of their respective calculations and work papers, to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Accountants_ ") for a binding and
nonappealable determination of the Closing Inventory Value to be rendered
within thirty (30) days after such submission. All fees of the Accountants
incurred in this capacity shall be billed to and shared equally by the Sellers
and the Purchasers.

  

(c) For purposes of determining the Purchase Price, if the Inventory
Value differs by more than five percent (5%) from the Closing Inventory Value,
the Base Price shall be (i) decreased, if the Inventory Value exceeds the
Closing Inventory Value, by the full amount of such excess, or (ii) increased,
if the Closing Inventory Value exceeds the Inventory Value, by the full amount
of such excess. Any Base Price purchase price adjustment required under
Section 3.3 shall be paid in cash to the appropriate recipient within ten (10)
Business Days after the amount of the payment is determined. Such payment
shall be accompanied by interest from the Closing Date calculated at 5 percent
per annum.

   

       



  |  

Section 3.4

  |  

_Adjustments for Discrepancies in Reserves_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a)  Promptly following the date that is six months after
the Closing Date, the parties shall calculate the aggregate payments made by
Purchasers with respect to Brand Products shipped prior to the Closing Date
and returned to any Seller or Purchaser on or after the Closing Date, net of
the aggregate proceeds of any sale, liquidation or other disposition of such
returned Brand Products or the net book value of any Brand Products returned
to

  



       
  

inventory, in each case, after such return, but not including any amounts
borne by the Sellers for their own account (the " _Returns Amount_ "). If the
Returns Amount exceeds by more than fifteen percent (15%) the Returns Reserve
certified in the Reserve Certification, Coty shall pay the amount in excess
of such percentage to Ascendia. If the Returns Reserve certified in the
Reserve Certification exceeds by more than fifteen percent (15%) the Returns
Amount, Ascendia shall pay the amount in excess of such percentage to Coty.
Any payment by either party hereunder shall not exceed One Million Dollars
($1,000,000).

  

(b) The parties shall seek in good faith to agree upon the
calculations referred to in Section 3.4(a) within ten (10) Business Days of
the date specified in Section 3.4(a). In the event the parties are unable to
reach agreement on either or both calculations, the disputed calculation(s)
shall be referred to the Accountants for resolution in accordance with the
procedure set forth in Section 3.3(b) hereof.

  

(c) It is stipulated and agreed between the parties that any
adjustment made pursuant to Section 3.4(a) shall be treated as a purchase
price adjustment.

   

       



  |  

Section 3.5

  |  

_Additional Purchase Price_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) In the event that, during the period commencing July 1, 2007 and
ending June 30, 2009 (the " _Earn-Out Period_ "), the aggregate U.S. Gross
Revenues derived by Sellers from the sale of Brand Products marketed under
_the Healing Garden_ brand (the " _Healing Garden Revenues_ ") exceed Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000), the Purchasers shall pay to Coty, for the
account of the Sellers, as additional consideration for the purchase and sale
of _the Healing Garden_ brand and brand-related assets (i) a cash amount,
equal to the lesser of (w) fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which Healing
Garden Revenues exceed Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and (x) Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000), plus the lesser of (y) twenty-five percent
(25%) of the amount by which Healing Garden Revenues exceed Seventy Million
Dollars ($70,000,000) and (z) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Cash
Amount_ "), and (ii) an additional amount equal to the lesser of (x) twenty
five percent (25%) of the amount by which Healing Garden Revenues exceed Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and (y) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), which
shall be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Note then outstanding
or, at Purchasers option, through the issuance of an additional promissory
note on terms and conditions identical in all respects (except as to principal
amount and issue date) to the Note (the " _In-Kind Amount_ " and, together
with the Cash Amount, the " _Additional Purchase Price_ ").

  

(b)  Not later than twenty (20) Business Days following the end of
each quarter during the Earn-Out Period, commencing with the quarter ending
September 30, 2007, Ascendia shall provide to Coty a calculation, certified
by the Chief Financial Officer of Ascendia, setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the Healing Garden Revenues for such quarter consistent with the
methodology used to calculate the Additional Purchase Price. Not later than
twenty (20) Business Days following the termination of the Earn-Out Period,
Ascendia shall provide a calculation, certified by the Chief Financial
Officer of Ascendia, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the Healing Garden
Revenues during the Earn-Out Period, the Cash Amount,

  



       
  

if any, and the In-Kind Amount, if any (the " _Final Calculation_ "). If Coty
disputes any of the amounts so certified by the Chief Financial Officer of
Ascendia pursuant to this Section 3.5(b) (notice of such dispute to be
furnished in writing not more than five (5) Business Days after receipt by
Coty of Ascendias calculation), the provisions set forth in Section 3.3(b)
shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_. For purposes of determining the validity of
Ascendias calculations, Ascendia shall make available to Coty and/or the
Accountants copies of such sales orders, invoices, shipping documents and
accounting records as Coty shall reasonably request. Any materials provided
by Ascendia shall be treated by Sellers and their Representatives as
Confidential Information of the Purchasers and Purchaser Guarantor for
purposes of Section 6.1.

  

(c) Any Cash Amount due pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be paid in
immediately available funds not less than five (5) Business Days following the
date of delivery of the Final Calculation, to such bank account as Coty, on
behalf of the Sellers, shall have designated in writing, _provided that_ if a
dispute arises with respect to the amount of the Cash Amount due, the amounts
not in dispute shall be paid within five (5) Business Days following the date
of delivery of the Final Calculation and the balance, if any, paid within five
(5) Business Days following resolution of such dispute; provided, however,
that interest shall accrue on the Cash Amount at the rate provided in the Note
or the Earn-Out Note from and including the date of the termination of the
Earn-Out Period to and excluding the date paid.

  

(d) Any In-Kind Amount due pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall, at
Purchasers option, either (i) be added to the principal balance of the Note
then outstanding, in which event such In-Kind Amount shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of the Note and shall be subject to the conditions
thereof, and Ascendia shall execute and deliver such amendment or other
document as may be necessary to give effect to such increase in principal
amount, or (ii) Ascendia shall execute and deliver an additional promissory
note, with a principal amount equal to the In-Kind Amount (an " _Earn-Out
Note_ "). An Earn-Out Note shall have terms and conditions identical in all
respects (except as to principal amount and issuance date) to the Note. Any
Note amendment or Earn-Out Note shall be delivered to Coty, for the account
of the Sellers, not later than five (5) Business Days following the date of
delivery of the Final Calculation or, in the event of any dispute, within five
(5) Business Days of the settlement of such dispute, _provided that_ in any
event interest on the In-Kind Amount pursuant to the Note amendment or the
Earn-Out Note shall accrue from and including the date of the termination of
the Earn-Out Period.

  

(e) For purposes of this Section 3.5, the term " _U.S. Gross
Revenues_ " shall mean gross revenues, derived by Sellers from sales to
customers located in the United States; provided, however, that (i) with
respect to SKUs existing as of the Closing Date, gross revenues shall be
determined based upon the documented prices in effect for each such customer
immediately prior to the Closing Date (or if no customer-specific price was in
effect, at the Sellers standard list price), and regardless of the actual
price at which such Products are sold following the Closing, and (ii) with
respect to SKUs introduced following the Closing, gross revenues shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP.

  



       
  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event that any Cash Amount or In-Kind Amount is due to Coty for the
account of the Sellers, as between the Purchasers and Purchaser Guarantor, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, the right of Coty to receive
such payment shall be absolute and unconditional.

  

Section 3.6 _Tax Allocations_. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Brand Assets assigned, transferred and conveyed at Closing
and (to the extent applicable) the covenants set forth in Section 6.13 in the
manner to be determined by the Purchasers and approved by the Sellers (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Sellers
and the Purchasers agree to use the allocations determined pursuant to this
Section 3.6 for all tax purposes, including without limitation, those matters
subject to Section 1060 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
change in law or final determination in appropriate proceedings.

except where the failure to do so would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Brand Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Sellers is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it or
the nature of the activities undertaken by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have,

necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the

are listed on **Schedule 4.3** and will be obtained in a timely manner
following the Closing) or where the failure of any such consent, approval,
compliance, exemption, authorization or permit to be obtained, action to be
taken or filing to be made would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Brand Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.4 _Non Contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Sellers of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not (a) contravene or conflict with or result in any
violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or

other similar authorization held by any of the Sellers and included in the
Brand Assets, or (e) result in the creation or imposition any Liens (other
than Seller Permitted Liens) on any of the Brand Assets, or that would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Brand Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.5 _Brand Financial Statements_. The Brand Financial
Statements attached as **Schedule 4.5** are true and correct in all material
respects and were prepared from the books and records of the Sellers in a
manner consistent with the Sellers internal accounting practices. The Brand
Financial Statements fairly present the product contribution of the Brands to
the operating income of the Sellers for the dates and periods indicated. All
financial information relating to sales, cost of goods sold, inventories and
variable operating costs associated with the Brands contained in the Brand
Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
consistently with Sellers prior practices, and such information is true and
correct in all material respects.

  



       
  

Section 4.6  _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 25, 2005,
the Sellers have operated the Brands, in all material respects, in the

that would, if adversely determined, have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Brand Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Order of any court or
arbitrator or any Governmental Authority outstanding against or relating to
the Brands that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Brand Material
Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.8 _Taxes_. Except to the extent that failure to do so would
not have a Brand Material Adverse Effect, each of the Sellers has timely filed
all Tax Returns and reports relating solely to the Brands required to be filed
by it, the due date for which (including any extensions with respect thereto)
occurred prior to the Closing Date, and has paid all Taxes as shown to be owed
on such returns and reports. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the Brand
Assets, except for statutory Liens for current Taxes not yet due.

  

Section 4.9 _Brand Inventory_. The Brand Inventory (excluding Obsolete
Inventory) is of a quality and quantity usable and salable in the ordinary
course of business, meets applicable manufacturing specifications and labeling
requirements and is free of defects in workmanship and materials. As of the
Closing Date, the quantities of each SKU of Brand Inventory are reasonable in
the present circumstances of the Brands in the ordinary course of the Sellers
business.

  

Section 4.10 _Title to Properties; Leases_. Each of the Sellers has
good and marketable title to, or in the case of leased property and assets,

the Brands, the Brand Products and/or any of the Brand Assets, (ii) all
unregistered trade names, trademarks, fragrances created for the Sellers by
third parties, and data (including docket data in hard copy and electronic

a Brand Material Adverse Effect. The rights of the Sellers to the Brand
Intellectual Property are free and clear of all Liens, except for Seller
Permitted Liens, and (i) no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, claim or demand is pending or, to the Knowledge of any
Seller, threatened in writing, which challenges the validity, legality,
enforceability, use or ownership of the Brand Intellectual Property, and (ii)
during the period of ownership or use by the Sellers of the Brand Intellectual
Property, no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, claim or demand has been instituted involving the Brand

use of the Brands, is infringing upon any copyrights, patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, computer programs, Trade Secrets or any other
intellectual property rights or proprietary rights of any other Person,
except that Coty has taken a nontransferable license from Applied Interact
in response to a claim that Cotys use of online sweepstakes, undertaken for
purposes of promoting the Brands, infringed one or more patents owned by
Applied Interact.

  

(e) Coty is the named sublicensee under the Calgon License that is to
be assigned to Purchasers under this Agreement. Sellers are not in default and
have not received a notice of default under the Calgon License and are unaware

United States and/or Canada for health and beauty aids for domestic use, nor
do the Sellers have knowledge of any plan or intention by Benckiser to offer
**** any additional license to the mark "Calgon" in the United States and/or
Canada. The Calgon License is assignable by Coty to Purchasers, and Sellers
will deliver to Purchasers, at Closing (i) the Assignment of Calgon License

they and their representatives have had a reasonable opportunity to meet with
the officers and employees of the Sellers to discuss the Brand Assets. The

acquire the Brand Assets without any representation or warranty as to
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, in an "as is"
condition and on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly
represented or warranted or expressly agreed to in this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.20 is intended to limit or modify

Purchasers right to rely thereon. The Purchasers acknowledge that, except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and the Schedules
referred to therein, neither the Sellers nor any other Person has made, and
the Purchasers have not relied on, any other express or implied
representation or warranty by or on behalf of the Sellers and that neither the

COVENANTS

  

Section 6.1  _Confidentiality_. (a) "Confidential Material" means
all information (whether written, oral, in computer-format, whether gathered
by inspection or observation and whether disclosed prior to or after the date
of this Agreement) which is proprietary to the Purchasers or Sellers, as the
case may be, or proprietary to others and entrusted to the Purchasers or
Sellers, as the case may be, whether or not trade secrets, including but not
limited to information relating to business plans and to business as conducted
or anticipated to be conducted and relating to past, current or anticipated
products or services; financial statements; operating and strategic
plans, projections or forecasts of financial results; technical notebook
records; patent applications; machine, equipment, process and product designs
including any drawings and descriptions thereof; unwritten knowledge and
"know-how"; operating instructions; training manuals; company computer
programs and print-outs; production and development processes and costs
thereof; raw material costs; selling costs; delivery costs; production
schedules; customer lists; customer buying and other customer-
related records; names and addresses of suppliers and vendors; tax
information; mailing lists; product sales records; territory listings; market
surveys; marketing plans; long-range plans; salary information; contracts; and
correspondence. It is expressly understood that to the extent any information
furnished by Sellers or their Representatives to Purchasers or their
Representatives pursuant to any Transaction Document, including the
Transition Services Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement, from and after
the Closing Date shall not concern the Brands and Brand Assets, such
information shall be treated as Confidential Information of the Sellers.
It is expressly understood

  



       
  

that any information furnished by Purchasers or their Representatives to
Sellers or their Representatives pursuant to any Transaction Document,
including the Transition Services Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement,
from and after the Closing Date regarding the Brands and the Brands Assets,
including all information regarding Purchasers forecasts, sales and
customers shall be treated as Confidential Information of the Purchasers.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchasers shall not disclose
Confidential Material of Sellers and Sellers shall not disclose Confidential
Material of Purchasers to any third party except as specifically provided
herein.

  

(c) Purchasers and Sellers each will strictly limit the number of
copies it makes of the Confidential Material of the other parties.

  

(d) Purchasers and the Sellers each will disclose information
contained in the Confidential Material of the other and copies of the
Confidential Material to only those of its respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, contractors, lenders or consultants (the "
_Representatives_ ") who have a need to know, and then only if those
Representatives are bound by this Agreement. Each of the Purchasers, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall be responsible for any
breach of this Section 6.1 by its Representatives.

  

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchasers and the Sellers each
shall use the Confidential Material of the other solely for the purpose of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

  

(f) Upon any termination of this Agreement, within ten (10) Business
Days after being requested by the Sellers or the Purchasers, as the case may
be, each party and its Representatives shall promptly return or deliver to the
Sellers or Purchasers all Confidential Material and all copies thereof
received from the other party. The portion of the Confidential Material
consisting of all documents, including memoranda, notes and other writings
whatsoever prepared by any party or its Representatives based on the
information in the Confidential Material shall be destroyed, and such
destruction shall be certified in writing by each party to the other by an
authorized officer supervising such destruction.

  

(g) From and after the Closing, all Confidential Materials related to
the Brand Assets shall no longer be Confidential Material of the Sellers,
shall be Confidential Material of the Purchasers and shall be treated as
Purchasers Confidential Material by the Sellers and their Representatives.

  

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall survive the Closing or
any termination of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and
supercede the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 4, 2006 between Ascendia
and Coty.

  

(i) Except as provided in Section 6.1(g), the foregoing
confidentiality provisions will not apply to any Confidential Material which
(i) was in a partys possession (other than as a result of its wrongful act)
prior to any disclosure thereof to the other by or on behalf of the Sellers or
Purchasers, as the case may be, and is provable by written records; (ii) is or
becomes public information other than through a breach by the receiving party
of this Agreement; (iii) is obtained on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Sellers or

  



       
  

Purchasers (or after the Closing is obtained by the Sellers from third parties
during the course of Coty US performance of services under the Manufacturing
Agreement or Transition Services Agreement), as the case may be, which source
has a lawful right to disclose such Confidential Material; or (iv) is required
to be disclosed by applicable law, court order or other legal process;
provided, however, in the event of a demand for a disclosure pursuant to this
clause (iv), Sellers or Purchasers, as the case may be, agree to immediately
notify the other party, in order to give the other party the opportunity to
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance
with the terms of this Section 6.1. In the event that such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or that the Sellers or Purchasers, as the case
may be, waive compliance with the provisions hereof, the other party agrees
to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Material which it is advised
by counsel is legally required and to exercise its commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such Confidential Material.

  

(j) Sellers and Purchasers agree and acknowledge that the
Confidential Material of the other has competitive value and significant
damage could result to such other party if it were disclosed or used in
violation of this Section 6.1. Each of Sellers and Purchasers acknowledge
that, in the event of any breach of this Section 6.1, the non-breaching party
may be irreparably harmed and may not be made whole by monetary damages. For
this reason, Sellers and Purchasers each agree that the other party, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law or in equity,
will be entitled to seek an injunction to prevent a breach of this Section 6.1
and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement. Each of Sellers and
Purchasers agree not to oppose the granting of equitable relief on the
grounds that money damages are adequate, and agrees to waive, and to cause
its Representatives to waive, any requirements for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy.

  

Section 6.2 _Publicity_. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and, except as may be
required by Requirements of Law or any listing agreement with the American
Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation. The parties acknowledge that Ascendia
will file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K, reporting such event and
including a copy of this Agreement (excluding the Disclosure Schedules) as an
exhibit thereto.

  

Section 6.3 _Further Assurances; Filings; Commercially Reasonable
Best Efforts; Nonassignable Assets; Retained Accounts Receivable_.

  

(a)  From time to time following the Closing, at the request of any
of the Sellers or the Purchasers and without further consideration, the
Purchasers or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause their
applicable Affiliates to, execute and deliver such further documents, perform
such further acts, and fully cooperate with each other, as may be reasonably
necessary in order effectively to transfer and convey the Brand Assets
(including, without limitation, the Brand Intellectual Property) to Ascendia
and Lander, as applicable, on the terms herein contained, and otherwise to
comply with the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  



       
  

(b) Each of the parties shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof and after the Closing Date, make all filings required to be made
by it under any Requirement of Law relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall reasonably cooperate with the other parties with
respect to such filings. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Sellers shall (and, to the extent applicable, shall cause their Affiliates to)
(i) make available to the Purchaser Guarantor and the Purchaser Guarantors
independent auditor, such financial data relating to the Brands and the Brand
Assets as they may have prepared prior to the Closing in the ordinary course
of business as the Purchaser Guarantor may reasonably request, to the extent
reasonably related to the Purchaser Guarantors compliance with a Requirement
of Law, and (ii) authorize (but cannot require) the Sellers independent
auditor to be available to the Purchaser Guarantor or the Purchaser
Guarantors independent auditor, to discuss information relating to the Brands
that the Purchaser Guarantor may reasonably request in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (or any other provision herein), (x) the Sellers
shall not be required to make available or provide any financial information
or data that is not in existence or readily accessible by the Sellers
substantially in the form requested by the Purchaser Guarantor, it being
understood that the Sellers do not maintain complete financial information
relating to the Brands on a stand-alone basis, and (y) the Sellers shall not
be required to incur any cost, expense, liability or obligations in connection
with such matters unless such matters arise or such information is required in
connection with a breach by a Seller of any representation, warranty or
covenant under this Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to (A) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Requirements
of Law or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (B) obtain from Governmental
Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or Orders required to be obtained or made by the Purchasers or
the Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
(C) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other submissions
either required or reasonably deemed appropriate by each of the parties, with
respect to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby required under Requirements of
Law. Neither the Purchasers nor the Sellers shall take any action that will
have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding compliance with any
Requirement of Law, and each of the parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to secure such approvals as promptly as possible. The
parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including by providing copies of all such
documents to the nonfiling party and its advisors prior to filing.

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents
shall be construed as an attempt, obligation or agreement to assign any Brand
Asset, including any license, certificate, approval, authorization, agreement,
Brand Contract, lease, permit or

  



       
  

other right included in the Brand Assets, which by its terms or by Requirement
of Law is nonassignable without the consent of a third party unless and until
such consent shall be given (the " _Nonassignable Assets_ "). To the extent
permitted by any Requirement of Law, in the event consents to the assignment
thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be held, as of and
from the Closing Date, by the Sellers in trust for Ascendia and Lander, as the
case may be, and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed
by Ascendia and Lander, as applicable, in the Sellers name and all benefits
and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Ascendias or Landers
account, as applicable. The Sellers shall take or cause to be taken such
action in their respective names or otherwise (provided any expenses incurred
therewith shall be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Ascendia or Lander, as the case may be, on the other hand) as Ascendia may
reasonably request so as to provide Ascendia or Lander, as applicable, with
the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or
other consideration that shall become due and payable under the Nonassignable
Assets, and the Sellers shall promptly pay over to Ascendia or Lander, as
applicable, all money or other consideration received by any of them in
respect of all Nonassignable Assets. As of and from the Closing Date, the
Sellers authorize Ascendia and Lander, as applicable, to the extent permitted
by Requirements of Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at
Ascendias or Landers expense, as applicable, to perform all the obligations
and receive all the benefits of the Sellers under the Nonassignable Assets and
irrevocably appoint Ascendia and Lander, as applicable, their attorney-in-fact
to act in their names and on their behalf with respect thereto. The Sellers
confirm that such power of attorney is coupled with an interest.

  

(d) The parties hereby agree to use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to resolve any claims made by third parties with respect to the
Retained Accounts Receivable, the Retained Liabilities or trade payables
relating to the Brands. Each Purchaser further agrees to cooperate with the
Sellers and, at the request of any of the Sellers and at the Sellers expense,
take such actions as are commercially reasonable to assist the Sellers in the
timely collection of any Retained Accounts Receivable, and any resolution of
any Retained Liability as further set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement.

  

(e) The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to satisfy each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 and perform their
obligations set forth in Section 7.4; provided, however, that Sellers shall
use their best efforts to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.2(k)
and perform their obligations set forth in Section 7.4(f).

  

(f) The Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to satisfy each of conditions set forth in Section 7.3 and perform
their obligations set forth in Section 7.5.

  

(g) To the extent that any representation or warranty set forth in
(i) Article IV of this Agreement is on the date of this Agreement untrue or
incorrect or becomes untrue or incorrect after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers covenant and agree to use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that all such representations
and warranties are true and correct on the Closing Date and (ii) Article V of
this

  



       
  

Agreement is on the date of this Agreement untrue or incorrect or becomes
untrue or incorrect after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
Date, the Purchasers covenant and agree to use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all such representations and warranties are true
and correct on the Closing Date.

  

(h) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or
(ii) the Termination Date, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and each of their respective Representatives to, cooperate with the Purchasers
and provide information relating to the Brands and the Brand Assets reasonably
requested by the Purchasers and Purchaser Guarantors lenders for such
lenders due diligence examination in connection with the financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(i) Sellers shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the owner of each warehouse in which Brand Inventory is held to, execute
and deliver to the Purchasers and Purchaser Guarantors lenders collateral
access and other similar documents granting such lenders access to Brand
Inventory held in Sellers or such third parties warehouses during the term
of the Transition Services Agreement or the Manufacturing Agreement that may
be requested by such lenders in customary form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers and such other warehousemen and such lenders.

  

Section 6.4 _Books and Records_. Each of the parties (a " _Records
Holder_ ") agrees that it shall preserve and keep all books and records in
respect of the Brands in its possession and relating to periods prior to the
Closing for a period of at least five (5) years from the Closing Date. In the
event a Records Holder wishes to destroy or otherwise dispose of such records
at any time after such five (5) year period, the Records Holder shall provide
to the Sellers or the Purchasers, as the case may be (the " _Requesting Party_
"), thirty (30) days advance written notice of such proposed destruction or
disposal. If a Requesting Party desires to obtain any such books or records,
it may do so by notifying the Records Holder in writing at any time prior to
the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal. The parties shall then
promptly arrange for the delivery of such documents. All out-of-pocket costs
associated with the delivery of the requested documents shall be paid by the
Requesting Party. The rights granted under this Section 6.4 shall be subject
to any limitations that are required to preserve any applicable privilege or
to maintain confidentiality.

  

Section 6.5 _Sales, Use and Transfer Taxes and Fees_. The Purchasers,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, will each pay one-half of
all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary,
excise real property transfer or gains or similar Taxes and one-half of all
United States Patent and Trademark Office recording, transfer and similar
fees, if any, incurred in the preparation and recordation of necessary patent
and trademark assignment documentation, due and payable upon or resulting from
the sale or disposition of the Brand Assets under this Agreement. Purchasers
shall be solely responsible for the payment of any non-United States Patent
and Trademark Office recording, transfer and similar fees and all post-Closing
fees of outside legal counsel in connection with the foregoing; provided,
however, that Sellers shall be solely responsible for the payment of all fees
and expenses necessary to secure trademark registrations for any primary
trademarks currently used on or in connection

  



       
  

with the Brands and any expenses incurred in connection with the clarification
of the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the
Trademarks Branch of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, whenever
incurred, as provided in the Consent and Amendment Agreement. For the purposes
of this Section 6.5, "primary" shall mean _Calgon take me away!_ , _the
healing garden_ and any other mark used by Sellers pursuant to the Calgon
License.

until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date,

operations and business with respect to the Brands and the Brand Assets only
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. By way of
amplification and not limitation, except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, none of the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries
shall, during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, except
as set forth on **Schedule 6.6** , directly or indirectly do, or propose to
agree to do, any of the following, without the prior written consent of the
Purchasers:

  

(i) amend or otherwise change the Calgon License, except as set
forth in the Consent and Amendment Agreement, or any other material agreement

(ii) sell, pledge, dispose of, otherwise encumber or subject to any
Lien or transfer any of the Brand Assets other than sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business;

  

(iii) waive any material right under, or amend in any material respect,
any Brand Contract;

 (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (d)
below, the Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold

collectively herein as the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Losses arising out of or relating to: (i) any Retained Liabilities
(a " _Retention Claim_ "); (ii) any material breach by any Seller of any

before the Closing Date; and (v) the enforcement of indemnification rights
under this Section 6.10.

  

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (e) below,
each of the Purchasers jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers (and their respective directors, officers, managers,
members, employees, successors and permitted assigns, referred to collectively
herein as the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ", and together with the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
any Losses arising out of or relating to: (i) the Purchasers ownership or use
of the Brand Assets or the Brands from and after the Closing Date; (ii) any
material breach by the Purchasers or the Purchaser Guarantor of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchasers or the
Purchaser Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) the enforcement of
indemnification rights under this Section 6.10.

  

(c) Unless otherwise required by Requirements of Law, the parties
acknowledge and agree that any indemnification payments made by the Sellers to
the Purchasers pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall constitute adjustments to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, and no party shall take any position
inconsistent with such characterization.

  

(d) The Sellers will have no liability to the Purchasers (or to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party) under Section 6.10(a)(ii) with respect to claims
of breach of representations and warranties set forth in Article IV of this
Agreement until the aggregate amount of all Losses relating to breaches of
such representations and warranties (such Losses to be determined without
regard to any materiality or Brand Material Adverse Effect qualifications

  



       
  

relating to such representations and warranties) exceeds One Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ "), and
once such Indemnification Threshold has been reached, the Sellers shall be
responsible for all Losses in excess of the first Six Hundred Thousand Dollars
($600,000) of Loss; _provided, however,_ that the aggregate liability of the
Sellers to indemnify the Purchasers (or any Purchaser Indemnified Party) for
all claims made under Section 6.10(a)(ii) for breaches of representations and
warranties shall be limited to an amount corresponding to twenty percent (20%)
of the Purchase Price (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ") and no indemnification
pursuant to such provisions shall be payable by the Sellers thereafter; 
_provided further_ , that the Indemnification Threshold and Indemnity Cap
shall not be applicable for (w) Losses arising as a result of a breach of

sweepstakes with respect to any of the Brands, including the continuation of
such sweepstakes by Purchasers following the Closing Date until their
respective published termination dates, or (z) in the event of fraud or an
intentional breach by a Seller of this Agreement.

  

(e) The Purchasers will have no liability to the Sellers (or to any
Seller Indemnified Party) under Section 6.10(b)(ii) with respect to claims of
breach of representations and warranties set forth in Article V of this
Agreement until the aggregate amount of all Losses relating to breaches of
such representations and warranties (such Losses to be determined without
regard to any materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect qualifications
relating to such representations and warranties) exceed the Indemnity
Threshold, and once such Indemnity Threshold has been reached, the Purchasers
shall be responsible for all Losses in excess of the first Six Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($600,000) of Loss; _provided, however,_ that the aggregate
liability of the Purchasers to indemnify the Sellers (or any Seller
Indemnified Party) for all claims made under Section 6.10(b)(ii) for breaches
of representations and warranties shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap and no
indemnification pursuant to such provisions shall be payable to Purchasers
thereafter; and _provided further_ , that the Indemnity Threshold and
Indemnity Cap will not apply with respect to (x) Losses arising as a result of
a breach of Sections 5.2, 5.9, 5.12 and 5.17 of this Agreement, (y) Losses
arising out of or relating to clauses (i) and (iii) of Section 6.10(b) or (z)
an event of fraud or an intentional breach by a Purchaser or the Purchaser
Guarantor of this Agreement.

  

(f) For purposes of this Section 6.10, to the extent any fact or
circumstance constitutes in substantial respects both a breach of
representation or warranty by a Seller and a Retained Liability, such fact or
circumstance shall be deemed to be a Retained Liability.

  

(g) Losses to be indemnified by Sellers or Purchasers under this
Section 6.10 shall not include any consequential, incidental, special,
exemplary or punitive damages.

Section 6.11

  |  

_Indemnification Procedures_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Promptly after discovery or receipt by any Indemnified Party of
notice of any demand, claim or circumstance which would or might give rise to
a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action,
proceeding or investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") that may result in
Losses, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof (the " _Claims
Notice_ ") to the Person or Persons obligated to provide indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.10 (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). The
Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail and
shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary, and to the extent
feasible) of the Losses that have been or may be suffered by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall thereupon give the Indemnifying Party
reasonable access to the books, records and assets of the Indemnified Party
that evidence or support such Claims Notice and any act, omission or
occurrence giving rise to such claim and the right, upon prior notice during
normal business hours, to interview any appropriate personnel of the
Indemnified Party related thereto. Not more than thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice
to the Indemnified Party that it either (i) accepts liability for the matter
set forth in the Claims Notice, and the amount thereof, or (ii) disputes such
liability and/or the amount thereof, and the specific grounds for such
dispute. Failure of the Indemnifying Party to give the notice provided in the
preceding sentence within the time period therein provided shall have the
same effect as if notice had been given in conformity with clause (i) of the
preceding sentence. If the Indemnifying Party gives timely notice to the
Indemnified Party that it disputes liability for the matter set forth in a
Claims Notice, and/or the amount thereof, the procedures described in Section
8.3 shall be observed.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at its
own expense and by its own counsel, any Asserted Liability for which it has
accepted, or is deemed to have accepted, liability pursuant to Section
6.11(a). If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such
Asserted Liability, it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature
of the Asserted Liability so requires) notify the Indemnified Party in writing
of its intent to do so. In such event, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate,
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or defense
against, such Asserted Liability and may also, at its option, choose to
participate in such defense or compromise through counsel of its choosing and
at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted
Liability after written notice to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party may settle
or compromise any claim over the written objection of the other; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) consent to settlement or compromise shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may settle
claims for monetary damages, only, without the consent of the Indemnified
Party; provided, that any settlement provides for the unconditional full
release of the Indemnified Party.

  



       
  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the
contrary, the failure to notify, or any delay in notifying, the Indemnifying
Party of an Asserted Liability will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Partys position is prejudiced as a result of any failure or
delay of the Indemnified Party in providing any Claims Notice to such
Indemnifying Party.

  

(d) If any Purchaser shall become aware of a material Retention
Claim, such Purchaser shall promptly give notice of such Retention Claim to
the Sellers, and the Sellers, to the extent they determine the Retention Claim
to be _bona fide_ , shall promptly pay, perform and discharge the Retained
Liabilities that are the subject of the Retention Claim.

  

Section 6.12 _Prorations_. All personal property Taxes payable by the
owner of any of the Brand Assets, and all supplier and other rebates, relating
to a time period beginning prior to, and ending after, the Closing shall be
prorated as of the Closing, with the amount to be settled and paid by the
parties as soon as practicable thereafter. The Sellers accrued liability (to
the Closing) for any of the above-described Taxes that are due and payable
after the Closing shall be payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

Section 6.13 _Covenant Not to Compete_. Each Seller covenants and agrees
that it shall not, and shall cause its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, as
they may exist from time to time (the Seller and such Subsidiaries being
referred to collectively as the " _Restricted Parties_ ") not to, for a period
of three (3) years from the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
compete, directly or indirectly, with the Brands (as comprised on the Closing
Date) or products associated therewith (a " _Competing Product Line_ ") or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the ownership, management, financing
or control of, or act as a consultant or agent to, or furnish services or
advice to (all of these being the " _Restrictions_ "), any Person who
competes, directly or indirectly, with the Brands or any product associated
with the Brands (as comprised on the Closing Date) in any form anywhere in the
Territory. If any Restricted Party shall breach any covenant in this Section,
the Restricted Period shall be extended by a period of time equal to the
period of breach. The Parties agree that the Restrictions shall not apply to
(a) Sellers fragrance product lines and ancillary products sold as part of
such fragrance lines; (b) products that are not marketed or positioned by the
Restricted Parties in the basic bath and specialty bath categories in the
food, drug and mass distribution channels; (c) products for which a Seller
serves as a distributor for an independent third party not affiliated with the
Sellers and such products carry the third partys trademarks, provided that
the total gross revenues of the products being distributed by the Sellers
comprise less than twenty percent (20%) of such third partys total gross
revenues for such products; and (d) any Competing Product Line that is
acquired (or for which a definitive agreement to acquire has been entered
into) by any Restricted Party (or an Affiliate of any Restricted Party) in an
acquisition or series of related acquisition transactions subsequent to the
Closing Date; provided (i) that the annual gross revenues related to such
Competing Product Line do not exceed the lesser of twenty percent (20%) of the
total gross revenues of the business being acquired by the Restricted Party
(or an Affiliate thereof) and Thirty Million Dollars

  



       
  

($30,000,000), and (ii) that the gross revenues related to the Competing
Product Line do not increase by five percent (5%) during any year within the
Restricted Period.

  

Section 6.14 _Insurance Proceeds_. At the Closing and assuming the due
performance of the Purchasers of their obligations to be performed on or
before Closing, all insurance proceeds attributable to the damage, destruction
or casualty loss of any of the Brand Assets on or prior to the Closing Date
shall be assigned by the Sellers to the Purchaser.

  

Section 6.15 _Employees_. Following the Closing, Ascendia shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to offer employment to, and to hire, employees
of the Sellers formerly involved in the operation of the Brands selected by
Ascendia with the prior approval of the Sellers and on terms and conditions
determined by Ascendia and each such employee.

  

Section 6.16 _Insurance_. For a period of one (1) year after the
Closing, the Sellers shall maintain in effect a policy of product liability or
discontinued products liability insurance covering the Brands prior to the
Closing. Such insurance policy shall have limits of at least $1,000,000 per
occurrence and $25,000,000 in the aggregate with no more than a $1,000,000
deductible. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, the Purchasers
shall maintain in effect a policy of product liability insurance covering the
Brands, applicable to events occurring after the Closing. Such insurance
policy shall have limits of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence and $25,000,000
in the aggregate with no more than a $1,000,000 deductible.

  

Section 6.17 _Asset Acquisition_. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not
constitute the acquisition of a "business" by the Purchasers as such term is
interpreted in accordance with the guidance set forth in Rule 11-01(d) of
Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.11-01) (" _Rule 11-01(d)_ "). The Sellers agree
that, upon the request of the Purchasers, the Sellers shall provide the
Purchasers independent certified accountants with any information that such
accountants reasonably request relating to the determination of whether a
"business" has been acquired under Rule 11-01(d) pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

  

Section 6.18 _Reimbursement_. To the extent that, within eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date, a customer takes any deduction, credit,
allowance or other financial accommodation (collectively, a " _Deduction_ ")
against an invoice relating to Brand Products shipped on or after the Closing
Date, and such Deduction is related to Brand Products shipped prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall reimburse the Purchasers not more than sixty
(60) days after receipt of notice of, and evidence reasonably documenting,
such Deduction. During such sixty (60) day period the Sellers may, using
reasonable commercial means, attempt to reduce or eliminate such Deduction
with the customer and, in the event that such customer agrees to reverse the
Deduction in whole or in part, the Sellers obligation to reimburse the
Purchasers hereunder shall be correspondingly reduced, but only to the extent
such Deduction is actually repaid by the customer to the Purchasers. After
Closing, the parties shall adopt such additional procedures as may be
necessary to implement provisions of this Section 6.18 in a fair and
reasonable manner.

  



       
  

Section 6.19 _Non-Use of Certain Domain Names_. The Sellers acknowledge
and agree that, from the period commencing as of the Closing Date and ending
on the date on which the Purchasers shall cease to be a sublicensee under the
Calgon License, (i) the website located at the domain name calgonbycoty.com
shall be inaccessible and (ii) if any Person shall attempt to access a website
located at such domain name, the message "The page cannot be displayed." shall
appear.

"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument referred to herein shall mean such agreement, instrument or statute
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case
of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

  

Section 8.6 _Waiver_. At any time, the Purchasers, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other party or parties, as the
case may be, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party or parties, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered under this Agreement or (c) subject to
Requirements of Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any waiver or extension, and any agreement on the
part of a party to any waiver or extension, shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

Section 8.7 _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year,
except that the representations and warranties set forth in (i) Section 4.8,
(ii) Section 4.10, (iii) the second sentence of Section 4.12(b) relating to
the Sellers title to the Brand Intellectual Property listed on **Schedule
4.12** and (iv) Section 4.13 shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (as applicable, the "Expiration Date"). Any
representation or warranty which is the subject of an indemnification claim or
dispute asserted in writing (or the subject of a proceeding) on or prior to
the applicable Expiration Date shall survive with respect to such claim or
dispute until its final, non-appealable resolution. The covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely, except for
those covenants and agreements that are limited by their terms to other dates
or times, which shall survive only to such dates or times.

  

Section 8.8 _Counterparts; Telecopier_. This Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all
of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Signature pages
exchanged by telecopier shall be fully binding.

  

Section 8.9 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each party shall pay all costs and expenses incurred or to be
incurred by, or on behalf of, such party and its Affiliates in negotiating and
preparing this Agreement and carrying out the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of attorneys,
investment bankers, finders, brokers, accountants and other professionals.

Section 8.11 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a
party shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy contained
in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties to
this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (without proving actual damages or posting
a bond or other security), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

Section 8.12 _Guaranty of the Purchaser Guarantor_. For good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are acknowledged,
the Purchaser Guarantor hereby guarantees the full and punctual payment and
performance by Ascendia and Lander of all the obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of Ascendia and Lander, as the case may
be (including indemnification obligations, but in all cases subject to the
limitations contained herein or therein, including the limitations on
indemnification in Section 6.10(e) and the limitations in Section 7.7 hereof),
contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Obligations_ "). The guaranty set forth in this Section 8.12
(the " _Parent Guaranty_ ") is a continuing, irrevocable and unconditional
guaranty of payment and performance, and, without limitation, is not
conditioned or contingent upon any effort to attempt to seek payment or
performance from Ascendia or Lander or upon any other condition or
contingency. If Ascendia or Lander at any time shall fail to pay or perform
the

  



       
  

Purchaser Obligations, the Purchaser Guarantor shall immediately upon written
notice effect complete payment and performance of the Purchaser Obligations.
The Sellers shall not be required to first pursue any right or remedy against
Ascendia or Lander. The Parent Guaranty shall extend to and cover every
extension or renewal of, and every obligation accepted in substitution for and
every modification of any Purchaser Obligation guaranteed hereby. No delay on
the Sellers part in exercising any right under this Section 8.12, or in
taking any action to collect or enforce any Purchaser Obligation hereby
guaranteed, shall operate as a waiver of any such right or in any manner
prejudice the Sellers rights against the Purchaser Guarantor. The Purchaser
Guarantor hereby waives any requirement that the Sellers exhaust any right or
take any action against Ascendia or Lander, as applicable;  _provided,
however_ , if at any time subsequent to the receipt of payment from the
Purchaser Guarantor with respect to a Purchaser Obligation pursuant to this
Section 8.12, the Sellers receive payment from Ascendia or Lander with respect
to such Purchaser Obligation, the amount of such payment shall promptly be
repaid by the Sellers to the Purchaser Guarantor. The liability of the
Purchaser Guarantor under this Parent Guaranty shall not be impaired, abated,
diminished, modified or otherwise affected by any event, condition,
occurrence, circumstance, proceeding, action or failure to act whatsoever,
including, but not limited to: (a) any increase in, or modification,
compromise, settlement, adjustment or extension of, the Purchaser Obligations;
(b) any waiver, consent, indulgence, forbearance, lack of diligence, action or
inaction on the part of the Sellers in enforcing the Purchaser Obligations;
(c) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, or similar
proceeding involving or affecting the Purchaser or Lander; or (d) the
invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement or any other document. The
obligations and liability of the Purchaser Guarantor under the Parent Guaranty
are independent of the obligations and liability of Ascendia or Lander. The
Purchaser Guarantor may be joined in any action or proceeding commenced by the
Sellers against any Purchaser based upon or in connection with the Purchaser
Obligations. The Purchaser Guarantor shall pay or reimburse the Sellers in
accordance with this Agreement for all costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs) incurred
by the Sellers in enforcing and collecting on the obligations and liability of
the Purchaser Guarantor under the Parent Guaranty and the Purchaser
Obligations. The Purchaser Guarantor waives all notices that otherwise may be
necessary, whether by statute, rule of law or otherwise, to charge the
Purchaser Guarantor or to preserve the Sellers rights and remedies against
the Purchaser Guarantor under the Parent Guaranty. No right or benefit in
favor of the Sellers shall be deemed waived, no obligation or liability of the
Purchaser Guarantor under the Parent Guaranty shall be deemed amended,
discharged or otherwise affected, and no provision of the Parent Guaranty may
be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Purchaser
Guarantor and the Sellers that expressly waives, amends, discharges or
otherwise affects, as the case my be, the Parent Guaranty. The provisions of
this Section 8.12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the
Closing.

  

Section 8.13 _Reliance_. Sellers authorize Coty to act on behalf of each
of them in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and agree that any act or
decision of Coty in connection herewith or therewith shall constitute an act
or decision of Sellers, and shall be binding upon Sellers, including, without
limitation, acceptance of any payment from Purchasers hereunder or thereunder.
No Seller shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest

  



       
  

the same. Purchasers and their Affiliates shall be entitled to rely on any
action or decision of Coty as being the action or decision of Sellers, and the
Purchasers and its Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for acts done by any Purchaser or its Affiliate in good faith reliance
on such action or decision. Notices given to or by Coty in accordance with
Section 8.10 shall constitute notice to or from Sellers for all purposes under
this Agreement.

  



       
  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Asset Purchase Agreement as
of the date first above written.

forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of the Term, a written notice to

(b)  Commencing on the Closing Date and subject to Section 3 hereof,
Coty shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Ascendia during the

shall provide complete brand and business reviews in accordance with
**Schedule 2(d)** attached hereto and made a part hereof, which may include

provided by Coty) (i) a list of SKUs, (ii) a description of the competitive
environment in which the Brands compete, (iii) any consumer research relating
to the Brands performed by Coty or on its behalf during the three (3) year

(e) Promptly following the Closing Date, Ascendia, in consultation
with Coty, shall develop a schedule within the Term (and the parties shall
follow such schedule) to transition customer account management on an account-
by-account basis.

  

(f) Coty shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
files, documents, reports and other written materials provided to Ascendia
hereunder shall be organized, packed, labeled and/or indexed so as to
facilitate identification and retrieval by Ascendia.

   

       



  |  

3.

  |  

_Term; Partial Service Discontinuation_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Coty shall provide the Transition Services for a period (the "
_Term_ ") commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the earlier of (i)
the date specified by Ascendia upon written notice as provided in Section 3(c)
or (ii) 120 days following the Closing Date.

  

(b) Ascendia shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assume
responsibility for performing the Transition Services as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date and may, upon written notice as
provided in Section 3(c), advise Coty that any one or more of the six
categories of Transition Services listed in **Schedule 2(b)** are no longer
required, whereupon Coty shall cease providing such specified Transition
Services and the Service Fees shall be reduced accordingly. Coty shall not be
required to resume the provision of any specified Transition Services once the
performance of such Transition Services has been discontinued pursuant to this
Section 3.

  

(c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, (i) if the
Transition Services to be terminated are Inventory and Distribution Services
(as described in Item 3 of **Schedule 2(b)** , the " _Distribution Services_
"), Ascendia shall provide Coty thirty (30) calendar days prior written
notice of such termination and (ii) if any other Transition Services are to be
terminated, Ascendia shall provide Coty, at least fifteen (15) days prior
written notice; _provided, however_ , that such Transition Services (other
than Distribution Services) may only be terminated as of the 15th or 30th day
of any month (or the 28th day of February) .

  

(d) (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Coty shall provide the Marketing Services for up to fifteen (15)
calendar days at no additional charge to Ascendia, provided that Ascendia has
not been able to meet with Cotys marketing staff prior to the Closing Date.
No later than fifteen (15) days after the earlier of such meeting or the
Closing Date, as applicable, Ascendia shall inform Coty in writing as to the
Marketing Services it wishes to elect for the remainder of the Term,
identifying from the person(s) listed on **Schedule 4.2** those that Ascendia
wishes Coty to retain for purposes of providing the Marketing

  



       
  

Services. Coty reserves the right to re-assign or terminate the employment of
any persons not designated by Ascendia.

   

       



  |

  |  

_Service Fees_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) In consideration of the provision of the Transition Services
listed in **Schedule 2(b),** Ascendia shall pay Coty on a monthly basis an
amount calculated in accordance with Item 1 of **Schedule 4** (the " _Service
Fees_ "). Ascendia shall further reimburse Coty for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing Transition Services set forth in Item 3 of **Schedule
4** (the " _Reimbursable Expenses_ "), provided that the services specified in
clauses (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 2 shall be undertaken at no
additional charge to Ascendia, and Coty shall be deemed to have been fully
compensated for the performance of such services through the payment of the
Service Fees paid pursuant to **Schedule 4**. For the avoidance of doubt, it
is expressly agreed that there shall be no duplication or double payment of
costs in determining the Service Fees and/or Reimbursable Expenses.

  

(b) Coty shall invoice Ascendia on a monthly basis, in arrears, for
the Transition Services. All invoices shall specify the categories of services
performed and the fees applicable thereto (pro rated, if appropriate, in the
event of a partial discontinuation of services pursuant to Section 3(c)), and
shall list in reasonable detail any Reimbursable Expenses for the period. Such
amounts shall be netted against amounts due to Ascendia from Coty pursuant to
Section 5.

  |  

_Settlement and Reconciliation Procedures_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Not later than the first Business Day following the fourteenth
(14th) day of each month commencing after the Closing and ending with the last
month during which Coty performs Transition Services hereunder, Coty shall
prepare and submit to Ascendia a statement (a " _Reconciliation Statement_ "),
setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the aggregate gross invoice value of
Brand Products shipped to customers during the preceding month (the " _Gross
Invoice Amount_ "), (ii) the aggregate adjustments and deductions applicable
to such invoices, which shall be based upon actual or allocated amounts (any
such allocations to be agreed upon by the parties prior to the Closing Date
based upon Cotys historical practices with its top 25 customers) (the "
_Invoice Adjustments_ "), (iii) the aggregate net invoice amount of Brand
Products shipped during the preceding month, which shall be determined by
deducting the Invoice Adjustments from the Gross Invoice Amount (the " _Net
Invoice Amount_ "), (iv) the amount to be withheld by Coty pending the final
reconciliation provided for in paragraph (d), which shall be five percent (5%)
of the Net Invoice Amount (the " _Holdback Amount_ "), (v) the aggregate
Service Fees attributable to Transition Services performed by Coty during the
prior month, determined in accordance with Items 1 and 2 of **Schedule 4** ,
and (vi) the aggregate amount of any Reimbursable Expenses incurred by Coty
during the prior month.

  

(b) In the event that the Net Invoice Amount for any month exceeds
the aggregate of (A) the Holdback Amount, (B) the Service Fees and (C) the
Reimbursable Expenses for such month, Coty shall pay the balance to Ascendia;
if the aggregate of (A) the Holdback Amount, (B) the Service Fees and (C) the
Reimbursable Expenses for any month exceeds the Net Invoice Amount for such
month, Ascendia shall pay the balance to Coty. Any

  



       
  

payment due pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable not later than two (2)
Business Days following the date upon which the Reconciliation Statement is
due pursuant to Section 5 (a), _provided that_ in the event Coty fails to
prepare and submit a Reconciliation Statement for any month by the date
specified in Section 5(a), any payment due by Ascendia with respect to such
month shall be payable not later than two (2) Business Days following the date
upon which the Reconciliation Statement is actually submitted.

  

(c) All Reconciliation Statements shall be submitted via electronic
means to such address as Ascendia shall from time to time specify in writing
to Coty.

  

(d) Within forty-five (45) days following the end of the Term, the
parties shall reach a final settlement of the amounts owed by each party
hereunder to the other and shall reconcile such amounts with the amounts paid
pursuant to Section 5(b) (the " _Reconciliation_ "). For purposes of this
paragraph:

  |  

_Purchase Price_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) _In General_. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the
purchase price for each SKU of each Product sold by Coty to Ascendia during
the Term shall be as set forth on **Schedule 2.2(a)** , as such Schedule may
be amended from time to time by agreement of the parties pursuant to
paragraphs (d), (e) and (g) of this section.

  

(b) _Credits Against Purchase Price_. Ascendia shall receive the
following credits against amounts due for the sale of Products manufactured
hereunder: (i) Ascendia shall receive a credit of $0.375 per unit (not per
case) on the first twenty million (20,000,000) units of Products purchased by
Ascendia hereunder, _provided that_ if Ascendia purchases less than twenty
million (20,000,000) units of Products hereunder within 180 days after the
Closing Date, Coty shall pay Ascendia in cash an amount equal to the
difference of $7,500,000 minus the product of the number of units of Products
purchased by Ascendia and $0.375; and (ii) during each of the four (4)
consecutive periods of thirty days commencing with the Closing Date, Ascendia
shall receive a credit equal to one-fourth (1/4) of the Raw Materials
Inventory Value, which shall be applied against the invoices issued during
such period (after first giving effect to the credit referred to in clause (i)
above) until such credit has been exhausted,

  



     
  

provided that the unused credit balance as of the end of any thirty day period
may be carried over indefinitely to one or more subsequent periods until used
in its entirety.

  

(c) _Current Products_. The parties stipulate and agree that the
prices for each Current Product shown on **Schedule 2.2(a)** shall remain in

Ascendia with a revised price list, which shall be effective with respect to
Products shipped by Coty from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008.

  

(d) _New Products_. Ascendia and Coty shall negotiate in good faith
with respect to the unit price of any New Products and **Schedule 2.2(a)**
shall be amended accordingly. If and to the extent that any raw material used
in manufacturing such New Product is also used in manufacturing any Current

purchase price of such New Product shall be the same as the corresponding cost
used in determining the purchase price of such Current Product(s).

  

(e) _Modified Products_. If (i) a Product is modified at the request
of either Ascendia or Coty, and (ii) such modification results in a change in
the consumption of any raw materials or in a change in the manufacturing

material or manufacturing costs shall be for the benefit or account of the
party requesting the modification, and **Schedule 2.2(a)** shall be amended

Product shall be the purchase price applicable to the Current Product that it
replaces.

  

(g) _Adjustments to Raw Material Costs_. Coty and Ascendia shall use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain raw materials for the
Products at the lowest available price, taking into account quantities
required, delivery dates and other relevant factors, and to identify and
qualify alternative raw material vendors, provided that Coty shall not be
required to purchase raw materials from any vendor if it has a _bona fide_
commercial or legal objection to so doing. Not less than five (5) months
following the date of this Agreement, the parties shall review the raw
material costs actually being incurred by Coty in manufacturing Products for
Ascendia and the possibility of reducing such costs for the remainder of the
Term, and shall make any necessary adjustments as mutually agreed to the unit
price of the Products. **Schedule 2.2(a)** shall be modified to reflect any
such adjustments. Such adjusted prices shall take effect for orders placed
after the close of business on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day following
the Effective Date.

  

(h) _Third Party Vendors and Manufacturers_. Coty shall not
outsource the production of any Product without the prior written consent of
Ascendia, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
_provided that_ Ascendia hereby consents to the continuation of any
outsourcing or contract manufacturing agreements in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, as listed on **Schedule 2.2(g)**.

be net cash within fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt of the invoice
from Coty. If Ascendia shall dispute all or any part of an invoice, Ascendia
shall not be required to pay the disputed part of such invoice until the
dispute is resolved. Ascendia shall notify Coty as to any items in dispute.
Upon resolution of the dispute (by negotiations between the parties or
otherwise), Ascendia shall promptly pay Coty any remaining amounts determined
to be owed.

  

(b) Ascendia shall advance Coty Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000)
on the Effective Date to cover Cotys costs of raw materials, manufacturing
and the like (the "Advance"). The Advance shall be credited against the
invoices submitted by Coty to Ascendia during the last thirty (30) days of the
Term after giving effect, first, to the credits referred to in Section 2(b),
and any balance remaining at the expiration of the Term shall be promptly

than thirty (30) calendar days after Cotys receipt of the Purchase Order
containing such Excess Order or such later date as may be specified in the
Resupply Order.

  

(c)  In the case of Products that are specifically made for customers
located outside the continental U.S. and subject to the foregoing, the
specified delivery date shall be not less than seven (7) calendar days after
the date upon which Coty receives the Resupply Order.

jurisdiction specified in the Preamble to this Agreement, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its

Brand Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 7.2 _Corporate Authorization_. Coty has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated

  



     
  

hereunder. The board of directors of Coty has authorized Coty to enter into

legal, valid and binding agreement of Coty.

  

Section 7.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Coty of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene or conflict with or

manufacture and sell the Products, and Coty has not received any notice of
violation or default with respect to any such approvals, licenses or permits.

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

COVENANTS

  

Section 8.1 _Manufacturing Requirements_. Coty covenants that all
Products manufactured and/or supplied under this Agreement:

   

       



  |  

(a)

  |  

will meet the Specifications; 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(b) will be manufactured in accordance with Coty Standard Practices
and Applicable Law;

  

(c) will not be adulterated, misbranded or otherwise in violation of

ARTICLE IX

  



  

INDEMINIFICATION

  

Section 9.1 _Indemnification_. Coty shall indemnify and hold Ascendia,
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, customers
and agents harmless from and against any and all liability, damage, loss and
expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs and
any reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and court costs incurred in enforcing
this indemnity and collecting amounts due under this indemnity) ("
_Indemnifiable Losses_ ") arising out of or resulting from (a) Cotys
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct in the manufacture of the
Products; (b) Cotys breach of its material obligations under this Agreement
or any representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein; or (c) any
personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the
Products in the ordinary course. Indemnifiable Losses under this Section 9.1
shall not include any consequential, incidental, special, exemplary or
punitive damages.

  

Section 9.2 _Procedure_. (a) Promptly after discovery or receipt by
Ascendia of notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that would or might
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or the commencement of any
action, proceeding or investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") that would
result in an Indemnifiable Loss, Ascendia shall give written notice thereof
(the " _Claims Notice_ ") to Coty. Any Claims Notice pursuant to this Section
9.2 shall be delivered to Coty on or before the Survival Date. The Claims
Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail to the
extent such details are available and shall indicate the amount (estimated,
if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of the Indemnifiable Loss that has
been or may be suffered by Ascendia. Ascendia shall thereupon give Coty
reasonable access to the books, records and assets of Ascendia which evidence
or support such Claims Notice and any act, omission or occurrence giving rise
to such Asserted Liability and the right, upon prior notice during normal
business hours, to interview any appropriate personnel of Ascendia related
thereto. Not more than thirty (30) days following receipt of the Claims
Notice, Coty shall give written notice to Ascendia that it either (i) accepts
liability for the matter set forth in the Claims Notice, and the amount
thereof, or (ii) disputes such liability and/or the amount thereof, and the
specific grounds for such dispute. Failure of Coty to give the notice provided
in the preceding

  



     
  

sentence within the time period there provided shall have the same effect as
notice under clause (i) of the preceding sentence. If Coty gives timely notice
to Ascendia that it disputes liability for the matter set forth in a Claims
Notice, and/or the amount thereof, the parties shall endeavor for a period of
twenty (20) days following Ascendias receipt of such notice to resolve their
differences.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the
contrary, the failure to notify Coty of any Asserted Liability will not
relieve Coty of any liability that it may have to Ascendia, except to the
extent Cotys position is materially prejudiced as a result of any failure or
unreasonable delay of Ascendia in providing any Claims Notice to Coty.

  

Section 9.3 _Step-In Rights_. Coty may elect to compromise or defend,
at its own expense and by its own counsel, any Asserted Liability for which it
has accepted, or is deemed to have accepted, liability pursuant to Section
9.2. If Coty elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, it shall
within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Asserted Liability so
requires) notify Ascendia in writing of its intent to do so. In such event,
Ascendia shall cooperate, at the expense of Coty, in the compromise of, or
defense against, such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Coty nor Ascendia may settle or compromise any claim over the
objection of the other; provided, however, that (a) consent to settlement or
compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b) Coty may
settle claims without the consent of Ascendia provided Ascendia is given a
full release of liability from the party asserting the claim. If Coty chooses
to defend any claim, Ascendia shall cooperate with and make available to Coty
any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense.

  

Section 9.4 _Right of Offset_. Ascendia shall have the right to offset
any claim for indemnity hereunder against any payments due from Ascendia to
Coty under the Note, subject to the terms and conditions of the Note and the
Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

Section 9.5 _Provisional Remedies_. (a) Coty acknowledges and agrees
that Ascendia would be irreparably damaged if any material provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any material breach of this Agreement by Coty could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition
to any other rights and remedies herein provided, Ascendia shall be entitled
to enforce any provision of this Agreement, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking.

  

(b) Ascendia acknowledges and agrees that Coty would be irreparably
damaged if any of material provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms and that any material breach of this
Agreement by Ascendia could not be adequately compensated in all cases by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other rights and
remedies herein provided, Coty shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this Agreement, in any court of competent jurisdiction, by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened

  



     
  

breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking.

CONFIDENTIALITY

  

Section 10.1 _Confidentiality_. The provisions of Section 6.1 of the

parties hereto agree to be bound thereby. The provisions of this Section 10.1
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE XI

  



  

 **TERM and TERMINATION**

  

Section 11.1 _Term_. This Agreement shall have a term of one year from
the Effective Date or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing
(the " _Term_ ), unless sooner terminated pursuant to this Article 11.

  

Section 11.2 _Ascendia s Optional Termination Right_. Except to the
extent otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, Ascendia shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement in whole or with respect to any specified
SKU of a Product at any time upon no less than three (3) months prior written
notice, and Coty shall thereafter have no further responsibility to
manufacture and deliver such SKU.

  

Section 11.3 _Breach_. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the
event of any material default by the other party that has not been cured
within thirty (30) days after such defaulting party has received written
notice thereof from the non-defaulting party.

  

Section 11.4 _Insolvency or Bankruptcy_. Subject to applicable
bankruptcy law, if any proceedings in bankruptcy or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee or any other proceedings under Applicable Law for the
relief of debtors shall be instituted by or against Ascendia or Coty, or if
either of such parties shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
such event shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by such party and the
other party shall have the option of immediately terminating this Agreement.

  

Section 11.5 _Events of Force Majeure_. In the event either party
becomes unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to an event
of Force Majeure, such party shall immediately notify the other party of such
inability and of the period for which such inability is expected to continue.
The party giving such notice shall be excused from such of its obligations
under this Agreement as it is thereby disabled from performing for so long as
it is so disabled, but in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days. If
such delay shall continue for more than thirty (30) calendar days, the other
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

  

Section 11.6 _Effect of Termination_. The representations and warranties
of Coty in this Agreement shall survive inspection, testing, acceptance and
use of the Products and for a

  



     
  

period of three (3) years after the termination or expiration of this
Agreement (the " _Survival Date_ "), and shall run to Ascendia, its
Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns. The termination or expiration of
this Agreement for any reason shall not release either party from any
obligation that accrued prior to such termination or expiration, or that, by
its terms, is to continue beyond such termination or expiration, including,
but not limited to, the warranty and indemnity provisions. The termination or
expiration of this Agreement shall not release Ascendia from its obligation to
accept and pay for Products delivered to it pursuant to Purchase Orders made
prior to the effective date of termination or expiration or release Coty of
any obligation to fill Purchase Orders received by it, prior to the effective
date of termination or expiration; provided such Products conform to the
Specifications.

  

Section 11.7 _Rights of Ascendia_. Without prejudice to Ascendias
obligations to Coty under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as restricting the right of Ascendia to contract the manufacture of
Products from Persons other than Coty, or to manufacture Products in its own
facilities.
