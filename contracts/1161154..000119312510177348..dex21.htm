with respect to the execution and delivery of all forms and authorizations,
and with respect to physical, drug screening and background checks. Each such
written offer must (i) state an annual base salary equal to such annual base
salary paid by Seller to such employee as of the date of this Agreement and
(ii) include a summary of benefits to which such Offered Employee will be
entitled, a copy of which summary will be furnished to Seller. Each
Offered Employee and Transition Employee who accepts such an offer of
employment with the SXL Employer is, as of the time of his or her addition to
the payroll of the SXL Employer and removal from the payroll of Seller,
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ," and collectively, such
Offered Employees and Transition Employees are referred to as " _Transferred
Employees_."

  

 

39 (b) If any Offered Employee whose non-immigrant employment authorization to
work in the United States is based on an employer-sponsored petition, such as
an H1B, and such Offered Employee accepts an offer of employment from the SXL
Employer and becomes a Transferred Employee, the SXL Employer agrees to comply
with all applicable Legal Requirements relating to the transfer of
sponsorship for that Transferred Employees status. The SXL Employer
acknowledges that any such Transferred Employee may not be placed on the SXL
Employers payroll until all legal steps regarding the transfer of H1B
sponsorship have been taken. Seller agrees to work with the SXL Employer in
support of any application for the transfer of sponsorship applicable to the
Transferred Employees employment authorization.

 

(c) Any Offered Employee who is on sick leave, leave under the Family and
Medical Leave Act, maternity leave or on disability on the Closing Date will
be offered employment pursuant to _Section 7.9(a)_ when such Offered Employee
is available to return to work; provided, however, that the SXL Employer will
have no obligation to offer employment to any such employee who is not
available to return to work within six months of the Closing Date.

(d) The SXL Employer will cause any preexisting condition restrictions, other
restrictions or waiting periods under Employee Benefit Plans maintained or
established by the SXL Employer to be waived to the extent necessary to
provide immediate coverage to each Transferred Employee who was covered as of
the Closing Date under Seller Employee Benefit Plans that provide medical or
dental benefits. The SXL Employer will cause any Employee Benefit Plan
maintained or established by the SXL Employer that is a welfare benefit plan
to apply any amounts paid under a welfare benefit plan of Seller or by a
Transferred Employee as deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs toward deductible,
coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits under such plan maintained or
established by the SXL Employer for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs (with appropriate adjustments for differences in plan years), but only
to the extent that Seller provides the SXL Employer with appropriate evidence
of the proper incurrence of such deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred under a Seller Employee Benefit Plan within the three month
period following the Closing Date. Such evidence will be in the form of
electronic files submitted within ten Business Days of the Closing Date and
monthly thereafter for the remainder of such three month period.

 

(e) To the extent that the number of years of service is relevant for purposes
of eligibility, participation or vesting under the SXL Employers vacation
policy or 401(k) plan only, such policy and plan will, to the extent allowed
by applicable Legal Requirements, credit any Transferred Employees with the
number of years of service rendered to Seller or its Affiliates as of the
Closing Date. For purposes of calculating the number of years of service for
each Transferred Employee, the date of hire included on _Schedule 5.19(a)_
will be used.

 

(f) Seller will pay to the Transferred Employees all compensation, bonuses and
incentive payments earned by the Transferred Employees up to, but not
including, the Closing Date under the terms and conditions of the Seller
Employee Benefit Plans.

(g) The SXL Employer will be solely responsible for any and all liabilities,
obligations and claims of any kind arising out of or in any way related to its
offers of

 



 

40  employment to the Offered Employees, its hiring of the Transferred
Employees, and/or the rejection of the SXL Employers employment offer(s) to
the Offered Employees.

 

(h) The SXL Employer will be solely responsible for any and all liabilities,
obligations and claims of any kind arising out of or in any way related to
the employment (or termination of employment, whether actual or constructive)
of the Transferred Employees by the SXL Employer on or after the Closing Date.
The SXL Employer will pay each Transferred Employee severance benefits
if within 12 months after the Closing Date, (i) the SXL Employer reduces the
Transferred Employees base pay and the Transferred Employee elects within 30
days thereof to terminate his or her employment with the SXL Employer or (ii)
the Transferred Employees employment is terminated by the SXL Employer
unless the termination of employment qualifies as a Termination for Cause.
Such severance benefits shall be no less than the severance benefits specified
on _Schedule 7.9(h)_. After such 12 month severance period, Transferred
Employees will receive the severance benefits generally provided by the SXL
Employer.

 

(i) Seller will retain all Seller Employee Benefit Plans and the SXL Employer
will not assume any obligations under any such plans. 

(j) Seller will be solely responsible for offering and providing any COBRA
Coverage with respect to any Offered Employee who is a "qualified
beneficiary" and who is covered by a Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"group health plan" and who experiences a "qualifying event" prior to the
Closing Date. The SXL Employer will be solely responsible for offering and
providing any COBRA Coverage required with respect to any Transferred Employee
(or other qualified beneficiary) who becomes covered by a group health plan
sponsored or contributed to by the SXL Employer and who experiences a
qualifying event on or subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes hereof,
each of "qualified beneficiary," "group health plan" and "qualifying event"
has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4980B of the Code.

(k) Seller will assist the SXL Employer in connection with its hiring process
with respect to the Offered Employees, including, to the extent permitted by
Legal Requirements, providing all information relating to each Offered
Employee as the SXL Employer may reasonably require (including initial
employment dates, termination dates, reemployment dates, attendance records,
personnel and status records, visa application and supporting documentation,
years of service, compensation and tax withholding history). Seller will
exercise all reasonable efforts to facilitate communication after the date
hereof between the SXL Employer and the Offered Employees, including without
limitation face-to-face meetings.

 

7.10 _Intercompany Obligations_. On or before the Closing Date and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein: 

(a) Seller will cause any indebtedness of the Company to Seller or Sellers
Affiliates to be paid or otherwise satisfied.

(b) Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to, pay or otherwise satisfy
any amounts owed by them to the Company.



 

41 (c) Seller will cause the Company to be released from any guarantee, credit
support or other financial assurances provided by the Company to or for the
benefit of any creditor of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(d) Seller will cause any guarantees, credit support or other financial
assurances provided by Seller or its Affiliates to counterparties who have
Contracts with the Company to be released, subject to Buyer complying with its
obligations in this  _Section 7.10(d)_. Buyer will at Sellers request at
any time as part of the Closing furnish any guarantees, credit support or
other financial assurances as may be required by the counterparties referred
to in this  _Section 7.10(d)_ so that Seller and its Affiliates can be
released from their obligations in that regard.

7.11  _Actions to Satisfy Closing Conditions_. Without derogating from any
Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, it is agreed that Seller
will act in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy, or
cause to be satisfied, all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8_, and
Buyer will act in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, all of the conditions set forth in _Section
9_. Each Party will cooperate with the other Party and provide the other
Party or its representatives with information in its possession, and not
otherwise available to the other Party, necessary to seek the approvals or
waivers referred to in  _Section 8_ and _Section 9_. Each of Buyer and
Seller will act in good faith in determining whether or not a condition in its
favor has been satisfied.

 

7.12 _Preservation of Records_. Buyer will preserve and keep the Records for a
period of seven years from the Closing Date, or for any longer period as may
be required by any Legal Requirements or Governmental Authority, and shall
make the Records available to Seller as may be reasonably required by Seller
in connection with an indemnification claim by Buyer, or a claim by any other
Person against Seller.

7.13 _Use of Names_. Buyer acknowledges that following a reasonable
time after the Closing, not to exceed 30 days, it will not be entitled to use
the name "Texon" or any variation or derivation thereof, including any logo,
trademark or design containing such name. Not later than 30 days after the
Closing, Buyer will remove from all of the Company Assets the name "Texon" or
any variation or derivation thereof, including any logo, trademark or design
containing such name, and will not thereafter make any use whatsoever of such
names, marks and logos.

7.14 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall each pay any sales, use, transfer, real property
transfer, recording, gains and other similar taxes and fees (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed on it by law as a result of the contemplated
transaction; provided, however, notwithstanding any such Legal Requirements,
each of Seller and Buyer shall bear half of the total of all such Transfer
Taxes. Accordingly, if either Party is required by law to pay more than its
half of any such Transfer Taxes, the other Party shall promptly reimburse such
first Party for amounts in excess of such half. Seller and Buyer shall timely
file their own Tax Returns relating to any Transfer Taxes as required by Law
and shall notify the other Party when such filings have been made. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other prior to filing such Tax
Returns to ensure that all such Tax Returns are filed in a consistent manner.
If necessitated by



 

42  Legal Requirements, Seller will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
thereto.

 

(b) At Closing, Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller a Texas Resale
Certificate with respect to the Included Seller Inventory in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer must deliver to Seller documentation in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller (i) evidencing that Buyer or
its Affiliate is appropriately registered under Section 4101 of the Code for
purposes of the federal excise Taxes imposed by Sections 4041(a)(l), 4081 and
4091 of the Code, and (ii) that is mandated by Legal Requirements to
substantiate that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not subject to such federal excise Taxes, including a
notification certificate or certificates under Treas. Reg. § 48.4081-5.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary or any
Legal Requirements imposing the burden of federal excise Taxes on Seller,
Buyer or both, Buyer is responsible for, and will, in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 10.1(b)_, indemnify, save, protect and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnitees from any and all federal excise Taxes imposed in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

7.15 _Risk of Loss_. The risk of loss with respect to the Company Assets will
remain with Seller until the Closing. In the event that prior to the Closing
any Company Asset is lost, damaged or destroyed, and such loss, damage or
destruction would reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
then:

 

(a) Buyer may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.1(f)_;
or

 

(b) Buyer may require Seller to assign to Buyer the proceeds of any insurance
payable as a result of the occurrence of such loss, damage or destruction and
proceed with the Closing.

7.16 _Hedging Positions_.

 

(a) Prior to and following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will cooperate
with each other in seeking the consent of counterparties to the novation of
Buyer for Seller with respect to the hedging positions effected by Seller for
the benefit of the Butane Blending Business through, under or using Sellers
existing master swap agreements, master netting agreements or
commodity accounts (collectively, the " _Seller Hedging Contracts and
Accounts_ "), as such positions exist at the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Closing Date Hedging Positions_ ") or, if requested by Buyer, Seller will
terminate the Closing Date Hedging Positions effective as of the Closing. If
Buyer requests Seller to terminate any Closing Date Hedging Positions, and
Seller may do so without incurring liability to any affected hedging
counterparty other than in respect of early termination payment obligations
under the terms of the relevant Seller Hedging Contract and Account, Seller
will cause such termination, to be effective upon Closing, and in that event,
any early termination payment made to Seller from the counterparty will be
paid over to Buyer on the Business Day following receipt of such payment by
Seller and any early

 



 

43  termination payment made by Seller to the counterparty will be reimbursed by
Buyer on the Business Day following Sellers demand therefor.

 

(b) If Buyer has not requested termination of a Closing Date Hedging Position,
but the novation of Buyer for Seller thereunder cannot be completed as of the
Closing Date, or if Buyer has requested that Seller terminate any Closing Date
Hedging Positions but Seller cannot do so without incurring liability to the
affected counterparty other than in respect of early termination
payment obligations under the terms of the relevant Seller Hedging Contract
and Account, then Seller will maintain the relevant positions for the account
of the Company and Buyer following the Closing (" _Surviving Positions_ ")
until the earlier of the date that the novation is completed and the date
that the particular position expires in accordance with its terms; provided,
however, that if requested by the relevant counterparty, Buyer will provide
the counterparty with an unconditional guarantee in favor of, or other credit
support acceptable to, the counterparty with respect to Sellers obligations
to the counterparty as they relate to the Surviving Positions. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyers provision of counterparty credit support will be
strictly limited to contributions to hedging positions specifically designated
to the Butane Blending Business. Specifically, any payment received by Seller
from a hedging counterparty in respect of any Surviving Position, whether as
credit support or on termination of the position upon expiration in accordance
with its terms, will be paid over to the Company on the Business Day following
receipt of such payment by Seller, and any payment required to be made by
Seller to a hedging counterparty in respect of any Surviving Position, whether
as credit support or on termination of the position upon expiration in
accordance with its terms, will be reimbursed by Buyer to Seller on the
Business Day following Sellers demand therefor. If Buyer has made any
payment to Seller as a consequence of credit support required to be given by
Seller to any counterparty under a Surviving Position, upon novation of the
position Buyer will succeed to all right, title and interest of Seller in and
to the funds posted by Seller as credit support.

(c) In the event an early termination event occurs with respect to a
Surviving Position other than pursuant to _Section 7.16(a)_, Seller will
assign to Buyer, without recourse or warranty, all of Sellers rights with
respect to the terminated position and Buyer will assume from Seller and
thereafter perform all of Sellers obligations thereunder.

7.17  _Non-competition_.

(a) Except as permitted by the Buckeye Letter Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may
be withheld in Buyers sole and absolute discretion, neither Seller, any
Affiliate of Seller nor Terry Looper (President and an indirect owner of
Seller) will, during the Non-competition Period, (i) own, finance, invest in
(directly or indirectly), render services to or operate a business that
competes with the Butane Blending Business within the United States, or enter
or reenter such business, or (ii) knowingly sell or supply butane to any
Person (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) for use at any gasoline terminal
or in any gasoline pipeline to whom at the time Buyer, the Company or any
other Affiliate of Buyer is selling or supplying butane or providing butane
blending services for such Persons use in blending butane with gasoline at
gasoline terminals or in gasoline pipelines within the United States, or make
any such sale or provide any such supply to any other Person that is known by
Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or Terry Looper to be acting as an
intermediary for a gasoline terminal or gasoline pipeline operator intending
to use the butane in

 



 

44  gasoline blending operations at such operators terminal or in such
operators pipeline to whom at the time Buyer, the Company or any other
Affiliate of Buyer is selling or supplying butane or providing butane
blending services; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 7.17(a)_
shall restrict the right of Seller, its Affiliates and Terry Looper to sell or
supply butane to a customer of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer for use at a
gasoline terminal, or in a gasoline pipeline, which is not, at the time of
such sale or supply, a terminal or pipeline supplied by Buyer, or any
Affiliate of Buyer, with butane or butane blending services. Seller
acknowledges that (i) the provisions of this _Section 7.17(a)_ are
reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and its
Affiliates; (ii) any violation of this _Section 7.17(a)_ may result in
irreparable injury to Buyer and its Affiliates; and (iii) in the event of
violation of this _Section 7.17(a)_, Buyer and its Affiliates will be
entitled to seek injunctive relief in accordance with this Agreement. In the
event that this  _Section 7.17(a)_ should ever be deemed to exceed the time,
geographic, product or any other limitations permitted by Legal Requirements,
such provisions will be deemed reformed to the maximum extent permitted by
Legal Requirements. At Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the written
agreement of Terry Looper to be bound by the provisions of this _Section
7.17_.

 

(b) Without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld
in Sellers sole and absolute discretion, neither Buyer, the Company nor any
other Affiliate of Buyer will, during the Non-competition Period, (i) own,
finance, invest in (directly or indirectly), render services to or operate a
gasoline/butane blending business that uses any of the Butane Blending
Technology outside of the United States or Canada or enter or reenter such
business, or (ii) sell or supply butane to any Person to whom at the time
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller is providing butane blending services for
use in blending butane with gasoline at gasoline terminals or in gasoline
pipelines outside of the United States or Canada, or make any such sale or
provide any such supply to any other Person that is known by Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer to be acting as an intermediary for an operator of a
gasoline terminal or gasoline pipeline not located within the United States or
Canada and (x) such operator intends to use the butane in gasoline blending
operations at such operators terminal or in such operators pipeline and (y)
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller is selling or supplying butane or providing
butane blending services to such operator at the time. Buyer acknowledges that
(i) the provisions of this  _Section 7.17(b)_ are reasonable and necessary
to protect the legitimate interests of Seller and its Affiliates; (ii) any
violation of this _Section 7.17(b)_ may result in irreparable injury to
Seller and its Affiliates; and (iii) in the event of violation of this
_Section 7.17(b)_, Seller and its Affiliates will be entitled to seek
injunctive relief in accordance with this Agreement. In the event that this
_Section 7.17(b)_ should ever be deemed to exceed the time, geographic,
product or any other limitations permitted by Legal Requirements, such
provisions will be deemed reformed to the maximum extent permitted by Legal
Requirements.

 

7.18 _Intellectual Property Developments_.

 

(a) In the event that Seller or its Affiliates document the existence of
future intellectual property made, discovered, invented, created, conceived
of, reduced to practice or fixed in a tangible medium of expression by Seller
during the Non-competition Period that is related to or used in connection
with any retained portion of the Butane Blending Business, Seller
will provide the Company with written notice of such intellectual property
within 60 days of documenting the existence of such future intellectual
property (the " _Notice of Future IP_ ").

 



 

45 (i) Except as provided in _Section 7.18(a)(iii)_, the Company shall have
the exclusive optional right, but not the obligation, to pursue any U.S.
patent applications directed to any portion of the intellectual property
described in the Notice of Future IP by giving written notice of such election
to Seller within 60 days of receipt of the Notice of Future IP (the " _Notice
of Intention_ "). If the Company does not respond to the Notice of Future IP
within such 60 day period, the Company will be deemed not to have exercised
its optional right to pursue any U.S. patent applications directed to the
intellectual property described in the Notice of Future IP.

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 7.18(a)(iii)_, Seller agrees not to file
any non-U.S. patent applications directed to any portion of the intellectual
property described in a Notice of Future IP until: (A) receipt of the
Companys notice of intention not to pursue any U.S. patent applications; (B)
the Company having been deemed not to have exercised its optional right as
described in _Section 7.18(a)(i)_; or (C) 180 days after the receipt of the
Companys notice to exercise its optional right to pursue any U.S. patent
applications on the developed intellectual property described in the Notice of
Future IP.

 

(iii) To the extent immediate filing of a U.S. or non-U.S. patent application
is required to protect any potential patent rights, Seller may file such
application as is necessary to preserve those rights after giving notice to
the Company. The Company shall have the exclusive optional right, but not the
obligation, to pursue any U.S. patent application filed by Seller pursuant
to this _Section 7.18(a)_ and to pursue any U.S. patent application claiming
priority to any non-U.S. patent application filed by Seller pursuant to this
_Section 7.18(a)_.

 

(iv) In the event the Company exercises its rights pursuant to any U.S. patent
applications directed to the developed intellectual property, Seller will
assign its rights in such U.S. patent applications to the Company. The Company
will assign to Seller all rights to any non-U.S. filings claiming priority to
these applications.

 

(b) Seller agrees to cooperate with the Company regarding the preparation and
prosecution of the Blending Patents and any future U.S. patent applications
directed to future intellectual property as described in _Section
7.18(a)(i)_. Sellers cooperation shall specifically include, but is not
limited to, sharing any and all information necessary for the preparation and
filing of any new patent application and the prosecution of any new or
existing patent application. Sellers cooperation shall also include, but is
not limited to, providing copies of all official correspondence to and from
any non-U.S. patent offices for the prosecution of any related non-U.S.
patent applications so as to enable the Company to comply with applicable
Legal Requirements regarding the duty of disclosure to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and to ensure consistency of statements made in the
prosecution of any U.S. patent applications and any related non-U.S. patent
applications.

 

(c) The Company agrees to cooperate with Seller regarding the preparation and
prosecution of any non-U.S. patent applications claiming priority to any
Blending Patent and any future non-U.S. patent applications directed to future
intellectual property assigned or to be assigned as described in _Section
7.18(a)(iv)_. The Companys cooperation shall specifically include, but is
not limited to, sharing any and all information necessary for the preparation
and filing of any new patent application and the prosecution of any new or
existing patent application. The Companys cooperation shall also
include, but is not limited to, providing



 

46  copies of all official correspondence to and from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office for the prosecution of any related U.S. patent applications
so as to enable Seller to comply with applicable Legal Requirements regarding
disclosure duties to any non-U.S. patent offices and to ensure consistency of
statements made in the prosecution of any non-U.S. patent applications and any
related U.S. patent applications.

 

(d) In the event that the Company or its Affiliates document the existence of
future intellectual property made, discovered, invented, created, conceived
of, reduced to practice or fixed in a tangible medium of expression by the
Company during the Non-competition Period that is related to or used in
connection with the Butane Blending Business, the Company will grant a license
to Seller to use, make, sell or offer to sell such intellectual property in
accordance with the terms of the Blending Patents License and the Software
License and Support Agreement, as applicable.

 

7.19 _Retained Causes of Action_. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
will commence any Retained Cause of Action relating to the Butane Blending
Business against any party (other than Buckeye Terminals LLC and/or its
Affiliates) that was a customer of Seller or the Company at the time of the
Closing without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 

7.20 _No Negotiation_. Until such time as this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to _Section 11.1_, Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall not
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage or entertain any inquiries
or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any nonpublic
information to or consider the merits of any inquiries or proposals from any
person or entity (other than Buyer) relating to any business combination
transaction involving the Company or the Butane Blending Business, including
the sale of the Companys existing stock, the merger or consolidation the
Company or the sale of the Companys business or any of the Company Assets
(other than in the ordinary course of business). Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer of any such inquiry or proposal.

 

7.21 _Parts and Inventory_.

 

(a) During the 90-day period following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will
agree upon what Company Parts and Equipment may be removed from the property
of the Company or Buyer for Sellers own use, it being understood that the
value of such Company Parts and Equipment shall not exceed $315,600. Seller
retains the right, upon reasonable advance notice to Buyer, from time to time
within 90 days after the Closing Date and at Sellers sole expense, to access
Company or Buyer property during normal business hours for the purpose of
taking and removing for Sellers own use such Company Parts and Equipment. 

(b) Seller will indemnify, defend, save protect and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from and against any and all claims arising from Sellers access
to Company or Buyer property and the exercise of Sellers rights pursuant to
_Section 7.21(a)_, including claims for personal injuries, property damage
and attorneys and experts fees, AND SPECIFICALLY FOR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF
OR CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY BUYER INDEMNITEE.

The obligations of Buyer at the Closing hereunder are subject, at Buyers

such conditions, Buyer may nevertheless proceed with the Closing without
satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any one or more of such conditions and
without written waiver. To the extent that as of the Closing Date Buyer has
knowledge of the failure of any of such conditions or the breach by Seller of
any of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement and
nevertheless proceeds with the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived
for all purposes any rights or remedies it may have against Seller by reason
of the failure of any such condition or the breach of any such representation

all material respects (disregarding individual qualifications as to
materiality, including Material Adverse Effect) as of the date of this

Seller, the Company or MCE Blending permitted by, and taken in accordance
with, the terms of this Agreement or the consent of Buyer.

all material respects with all of its obligations under this Agreement which

The obligations of Seller at the Closing hereunder are subject, at Sellers
election, to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the
conditions set forth below. Notwithstanding the failure of any one or more of
such conditions, Seller may nevertheless proceed with the Closing without
satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any one or more of such conditions and
without written waiver. To the extent that as of the Closing Date Seller has
knowledge of the failure of any of such conditions or the breach by Buyer of
any of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement and

seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Closing in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof.

 

SECTION 10. _INDEMNIFICATION_.

 

10.1 _Obligation of Parties to Indemnify_.

 

(a) _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9_ and in this _Section 10_, Seller will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and Equity Interest holders (collectively, the "
_Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all claims, losses, damages,
liabilities, deficiencies, Taxes, penalties, assessments, obligations or
expenses of any kind or type, including reasonable third-party legal fees and
expenses, but excluding lost profits or other 



 

49  consequential or punitive damages claimed by the Indemnified Party for its
own account (collectively, " _Losses_ "), to the extent arising or resulting
from (i) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 5_ of this Agreement; provided, however, that for
purposes of determining under this _Section 10.1(a)_ whether any
representation or warranty made by Seller in _Section 5_ that is qualified
by materiality (including Material Adverse Effect) has been breached, all such
materiality qualifiers shall be disregarded as though they were not contained
therein, (ii) any nonfulfillment of any covenant or obligation of Seller or
the Company under this Agreement, (iii) any Third Party Claims made in writing
on or before the date that is the second anniversary of the Closing Date
arising from the ownership of the Company Assets, the operation of the Butane
Blending Business or any Environmental Liability before the Closing Date or
(iv) the Retained Liabilities.

 

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 8_ and this _Section 10_, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and Equity Interest holders (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses to the extent
arising or resulting from (i) any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section 6_ of this Agreement, (ii)
nonfulfillment of any covenant or obligation of Buyer under this Agreement
and (iii) the ownership or operation of the Butane Blending Business before or
after the Closing Date except for those Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees
are entitled to indemnification by Seller pursuant to  _Section 10.1(a)_.

(c) _Exception to Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder from and after the Closing with respect to a breach
by an Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder
of which such Indemnified Party had knowledge as of the Closing Date.

10.2 _[RESERVED]_.

 

10.3 _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Person who has the right to be indemnified under _Sections 10.1(a)_
or _10.1(b)_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the
commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a
third party (including, but not limited to, any Governmental Authority) or the
imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought
under _Sections 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Section 10_,
the Indemnified Party will promptly provide the Party that has agreed to
indemnify hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with notice of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in or, at
its option, assume the defense, appeal or settlement of such Third Party
Claim (provided that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder but without admitting liability to the third
party). Such defense, appeal or settlement will be conducted through
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party must fully cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in connection therewith. The Indemnified Party will be entitled, at its
own expense, to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim.



 

50 (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to so assume the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim within 20 Business Days after receipt of
notice thereof from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will have the
right to undertake the defense, appeal or settlement of such Third Party Claim
and, if such Third Party Claim is one for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 10_, such defense, appeal or
settlement of such Third Party Claim will be at the expense and for the
account of the Indemnifying Party. 

(c) The Indemnifying Party must obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld) before
entering into or making any settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of the validity of any Third Party Claim or any liability in
respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party.

 

(d) No Indemnifying Party may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement of a Third Party Claim that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff of a
release to each Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such claim.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 10.3(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be
entitled to control (but will be entitled to participate at its own expense
in) the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any
Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense within 20 Business Days after receipt of notice thereof from the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not enter
into any settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give
rise to liability on the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior
written consent of such Indemnifying Party, which may not be unreasonably
withheld.

10.4 _Direct Claims_. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to _Section 10.3_ because no
Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Losses which the Indemnified Party
claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof.

10.5 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Covenants_. Each
representation and warranty contained in _Section 5_ (other than _Sections
5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.7_ , _5.16_ , _5.17_ , _5.18(c)_ , _5.18(d)_ and
_5.22_ ) will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect
until the date that is two years after the Closing Date. The representations
and warranties of Seller contained in _Section 5.22_ will survive the Closing
and will continue in full force and effect until the date that is 90 days
after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties of Seller contained
in _Section 5.16_ will survive the Closing and will continue in full force
and effect until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The
representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Sections 5.18(c)_ and
_5.18(d)_ (the " _IP Representations_ ") will survive the Closing and will
continue in full force and effect until the date that is four years after the
Closing Date. The representations and warranties of Seller contained in
_Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.7_ and _5.17_ and of Buyer contained in
_Section 6_ (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") will
survive the Closing without limitation as to time. No claim for Loss based
upon the failure of a Party to

 



 

51  have complied with a covenant which by its terms is required to be performed
or complied with prior to the Closing Date may be made after two years after
the Closing Date.

 

10.6 _Indemnification Limitations_. No claim for indemnification may be made
under _Section 10.1(a)_ or  _Section 10.1(b)_ for any individual claims or
related claims unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses (excluding all
individual or related Losses below $100,000, for which no Party shall have any
indemnification liability) of the Indemnified Party that may be claimed
respectively thereunder exceeds $1,400,000, and once such threshold has been
reached, the Indemnifying Party will be liable to the Indemnified Party only
for the Losses (excluding all individual or related Losses below $100,000) on
a dollar-for-dollar basis above such threshold. Sellers liability under
_Section 10.1(a)_ (the " _Indemnification Cap_ ") shall be limited as
follows: (i) for Losses claimed before the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, to an aggregate amount equal to 25% of the Membership Interest Base
Purchase Price; (ii) for Losses claimed after the second anniversary of the
Closing Date but prior to the third anniversary thereof, the difference
between (A) $20,000,000 _minus_ (B) Losses claimed under clause (i); and (iii)
for Losses claimed after the third anniversary of the Closing Date but prior
to the fourth anniversary thereof, the difference between (A) $10,000,000
_minus_ (B) the sum of Losses claimed under clauses (i) and (ii).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the limitations set forth in the first
sentence of this _Section 10.6_ shall not apply in the case of Losses
arising from the breach by a Party of any of its respective Fundamental
Representations or from the Retained Liabilities, and (ii) the Indemnification
Cap for Sellers liability under _Section 10.1(a)_ for Losses arising from
the breach of any of Sellers Fundamental Representations shall be limited in
the aggregate to an amount equal to the Membership Interest Base Purchase
Price.

 

10.7 _Treatment of Payments_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to
this _Section 10_ will be treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to
the Membership Interest Base Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise
prescribed by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) for claims based on a Partys
intentionally fraudulent acts or omissions and (ii) for any equitable actions
for specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief with respect
to any covenants or obligations to be performed after the Closing, from and
after the Closing, (A) the indemnification provided in this _Section 10_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Party hereto arising out of,
related to, in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the Butane
Blending Business, including without limitation any breaches of covenants,
representations or warranties, and indemnifiable events under this _Section
10_, and (B) each of the Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent it may
lawfully do so, any rights of contribution, indemnification or otherwise,
causes of action, remedies or damages that it may have or assert against the
other Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether under statutory or common law, any Environmental
Law, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Texas Securities Act and
similar state Legal Requirements, or any trade regulation or other Legal
Requirements.

 

10.9 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary if, on the Closing Date, (i) all the conditions to the obligations
of a Party contained in _Section 8_ or _Section 9_, as applicable, have been
satisfied or waived by that Party (the " _Defaulting Party_ "), and (ii) the
other Party (the " _Non-Defaulting Party_ ") has notified the Defaulting
Party of the Non-Defaulting Partys intention to consummate the transactions
contemplated under this

 



 

52  Agreement and has furnished evidence of its willingness and ability to do
so, and if the Closing does not then occur due to the refusal of the
Defaulting Party to consummate the Closing, then the Non-Defaulting Party
will be entitled to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement in a
court of competent jurisdiction, it being acknowledged that monetary damages
due to the Non-Defaulting Party in such case cannot be adequately
determined at law. An action for specific performance by the Non-Defaulting
Party hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any unfulfilled condition
required of the Defaulting Party, if any, under _Section 8_ or _Section 9_,
as applicable. The existence of this right shall not preclude any other
rights and remedies at law or in equity, including, without limitation, any
rights under _Section 11_, which the Non-Defaulting Party may have.

 

SECTION 11. _TERMINATION_.

 

11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned on or prior
to the Closing Date as follows:

 

(a) by Buyer if a material breach of any provision of this Agreement has been
committed by Seller and such breach either has not been cured by Seller, or
Seller has not diligently commenced commercially reasonable action to cure
such breach, within 20 Business Days after written notice from Buyer to Seller
of such breach or such breach has not been waived by Buyer, and Buyer is not
then in material breach of this Agreement;

(b) by Seller if a material breach of any provision of this Agreement has
been committed by Buyer and such breach either has not been cured by Buyer,
or Buyer has not diligently commenced commercially reasonable action to cure
such breach within 20 Business Days after written notice from Seller to Buyer
of such breach or such breach has not been waived by Seller, and Seller is
not then in material breach of this Agreement;

(c) by Buyer if any condition in _Section 8_ has not been satisfied as of
the Closing Date and if the satisfaction of such a condition by the Outside
Date is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement), and Buyer has not waived
such condition on or before such date and Buyer is not then in material breach
of this Agreement;

 

(d) by Seller if any condition in _Section 9_ has not been satisfied as of
the Closing Date and if the satisfaction of such a condition by the Outside
Date is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Seller to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement), and Seller has not waived
such condition on or before such date and Seller is not then in
material breach of this Agreement;

(e) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

 

(f) by Buyer, if prior to Closing any Company Asset is lost, damaged or
destroyed and such loss, damage or destruction would reasonably be likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect; or

(g) by either Party if the Closing has not occurred by September 30, 2010
(the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that if the failure to close is
the result of the inability of

 



 

53  Seller or the Company to obtain a Required Consent or of Buyer or Seller to
obtain one or more material consents or approvals from any Governmental
Authority on or prior to the Outside Date, but all other conditions to the
Closing have been fulfilled or shall be mutually agreed to be capable of being
fulfilled, then the Outside Date may be extended at the request of the Party
unable to obtain such consent or approval for three additional periods of 30
days each, if such affected Party, acting in good faith, reasonably believes
that such consent is likely to be obtained within such period; provided
further, however, that if the failure to close is the result of a failure of
a condition precedent arising from a breach with respect to which the Party
in breach is entitled to cure pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_ or _Section
11.1(b)_, as applicable, the Outside Date will automatically be extended for
an additional period of 60 days.

In the event of termination by either Party as provided above, written notice
shall promptly be given to the other Party and each Party shall pay its own
expenses incident to the preparation for the consummation of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination and abandonment
of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 11.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect without any liability on the part of
either Party hereto or any of its Affiliates other than pursuant to _Section
11.3_. Nothing contained in this  _Section 11.2_ shall relieve any party
from liability for any deliberate, knowing or intentional breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.

 

11.3 _Expenses_.

 

(a) In the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections
11.1(a)_ or _11.1(c)_ , in addition to any other remedies that Buyer may have
as a result of such termination, Seller must reimburse Buyer for the costs,
fees and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement.

 

(b) Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 11.1(b)_ or
_11.1(d)_ , in addition to any other remedies that Seller may have as a
result of such termination, Buyer must reimburse Seller for the costs, fees
and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 12. _GUARANTY OF BUYER_.

 

12.1 _Buyer Guarantor_. Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P. (" _Buyer
Guarantor_ ") hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the
prompt and full discharge, payment and performance by Buyer of all of its
obligations under this Agreement and all other agreements, instruments or
undertakings of Buyer contemplated herein or hereby, including without
limitation the due and punctual payment of the Closing Amount payable by Buyer
at the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (collectively, the " _Buyer
Obligation_ "), in accordance with the terms hereof. Buyer Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to the Buyer Obligation, such
guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection
and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies
against Buyer. If Buyer shall default in the due and punctual performance of
the Buyer Obligation,



 

54  Buyer Guarantor will perform or cause to be performed such Buyer Obligation
and will make full payment of any amount due with respect thereto at its sole
cost and expense.

 

12.2 _Guaranty Unconditional_. The liabilities and obligations of Buyer
Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement are unconditional and absolute and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

 

(b) any acceleration, extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
release in respect of any of the Buyer Obligations or other obligation of
Buyer under this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise;

(c) the invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of this
Agreement;

(d) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement;

 

(e) any change in the limited liability company or limited partnership
existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or Buyer Guarantor, as applicable,
or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting any of them or their assets; or

 

(f) any other act, omission to act, delay of any kind by any Party or any
other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the
provisions of this _Section 12.2_, constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of the obligations of Buyer Guarantor hereunder.

 

12.3 _Representations and Warranties_. Buyer Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants to Seller that:

 

(b) Buyer Guarantor is a limited partnership, duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas. Buyer has all
requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer
Guarantor and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary actions of Buyer Guarantor, and this
Agreement is, and any documents or instruments to be executed and delivered
by Buyer Guarantor pursuant hereto will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Buyer Guarantor enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, or similar laws from time to time in effect which affect
creditors rights generally and by legal and equitable limitations on the
availability of equitable remedies.

 

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby by Buyer Guarantor and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not
conflict with or violate or constitute a breach or default under the
organizational documents of Buyer Guarantor or any provision of any mortgage,
trust indenture, Lien, Contract, court order, judgment or decree to which
Buyer Guarantor is bound.

12.4 _Waivers of the Buyer Guarantor_. Buyer Guarantor hereby waives any
right, whether legal or equitable, or statutory or non-statutory, to require
Seller to proceed against or

 



 

55  take any action against or pursue any remedy with respect to Buyer or any
other Person or make presentment or demand for performance or give any notice
of nonperformance before Seller may enforce its rights hereunder against
Buyer Guarantor.

12.5 _Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances_. If at any time any performance
by any Person of the Buyer Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise
restored or returned, whether upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of Buyer or otherwise, Buyer Guarantors obligations with
respect to the Buyer Obligation shall be reinstated at such time as though
the Buyer Obligation had become due and had not been performed.

12.6  _Subrogation_. Buyer Guarantor waives any rights of subrogation to the
rights of Seller against Buyer with respect to the Buyer Obligation.

 

SECTION 13. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 

13.1 _Expenses_. Except as specifically provided in _Section 11.3_, each of
the Parties hereto agrees to be responsible for its own, without right of
reimbursement from the other, costs incurred by it incident to the performance
of its obligations hereunder, whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be consummated, including, without limitation, those
costs incident to the preparation of this Agreement, and the fees and
disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and consultants employed by the
respective Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

13.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party and any attempted
assignment without such written consent shall be null and void and without
legal effect; provided, however, Buyer may assign its right to purchase the
Membership Interest or the Included Seller Inventory hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of Buyer, and each such assignee shall become a "Buyer" hereunder,
but any such assignment shall not alter or change the obligations of Buyer
hereunder.

 

13.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance.

 

13.4 _Amendment and Modification_. Buyer and Seller may amend, modify and
supplement this Agreement in such manner as may be mutually agreed by them in
writing.

13.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be deemed to be duly given if delivered by
hand, if mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, if

prior to any release or statement; provided, however, that without the prior
