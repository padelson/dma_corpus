terminate this agreement without, except as otherwise provided in this
agreement, any liability to the other party because of that termination,

     3.6  |   | Certain notices  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Notice of failure of condition precedent:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | If, before the time specified for satisfaction of

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Waiver: A waiver of a breach or non-fulfilment in
respect of one condition precedent does not constitute:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | a waiver of breach or non-fulfilment of any other
condition precedent resulting from the same event; or  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (2)  |   | a waiver of breach or non-fulfilment of that

     3.8  |   | Tax Matters  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The parties intend that the Transaction shall constitute a

     4  |   | Plan  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     4.1  |   | Plan  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Palmarejo covenants to pursue the Plan, under which all of the
Palmarejo Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) will be transferred to
Canadian Bidco in consideration for the Plan Consideration and otherwise in
accordance with the Plan, and under which holders of Warrants and Options
will, in accordance with their terms, be entitled to receive upon
the exercise of such securities, in lieu of each Palmarejo Share to which
such holders would have been entitled upon such exercise, the Plan
Consideration.  
   

  

     4.2  |   | Plan consideration  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Subject to this clause 4.2, Coeur covenants to
Palmarejo that in consideration of the transfer to Canadian Bidco of each
Plan Share under the terms of the Plan, Coeur will cause Canadian Bidco to
accept such transfer and provide the Plan Consideration to the Plan
Shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Plan.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Subject to customary provisions which address
share splitting or division in an attempt to obtain advantage by reference to
rounding, any fractional entitlement of a Palmarejo Shareholder to a Coeur
Share as part of the Plan Consideration will be rounded up in the case of any
entitlement to half or more of a Coeur Share or otherwise rounded up or down
to the nearest whole number of Coeur Shares. Any fractional entitlement of a
Palmarejo Shareholder to a cent will be rounded up in the case of
any entitlement to half of a cent or otherwise rounded up or down to the
nearest cent; provided that if a Palmarejo Shareholder is entitled to less
than one cent, such Palmarejo Shareholder shall be entitled to receive one
cent.  
---|---|---|--- 
    

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (c)  |   | Where a Palmarejo Shareholder is an Ineligible
Overseas Shareholder in relation to the issue of Coeur Shares, the number of
Coeur Shares to which the Palmarejo Shareholder would otherwise be entitled
under the Plan will be issued to a nominee appointed by agreement between
Palmarejo and Coeur who will sell those Coeur Shares as soon as practicable
and in any event not more than 28 days after the Effective Date (at the risk
of that Ineligible Overseas Shareholder) and remit to Palmarejo the
proceeds received, after deducting any applicable brokerage, costs, taxes and
charges, to that Ineligible Overseas Shareholder in full satisfaction of that
Ineligible Overseas Shareholders rights in relation to Coeur Shares under
the Plan.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     4.3  |   | Status of Coeur Shares  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The Coeur Shares to be issued by Coeur as part of the Plan
Consideration will rank pari passu with all existing Coeur Shares then
outstanding and will be fully-paid and issued free from any mortgage, charge,
lien, encumbrance or other security interest.  
      
    |   | The Coeur Shares will be issued pursuant to an exemption from
the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities Law and from the
registration requirements provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). In the event that the
exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the 1933 Act is not
available for any reason to exempt the issuance of the Coeur Shares in
accordance with the Plan from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act,
then Coeur shall take all necessary action to file a registration statement
on Form S-4 (or on such other form that may be available to Coeur) in order
to register such Coeur Shares and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective
at or prior to the Effective Date. Palmarejo acknowledges that the Coeur
Shares issued to "affiliates" (as defined under Rule 144 of the 1993 Act) of
Palmarejo may be resold in the manner permitted under Rules 145(c) and (d)
and Regulation S of the 1933 Act.  
   

  

     4.4  |   | Withholding Rights  
---|---|---

of this agreement and the Plan such amounts as it is required or permitted to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the tax Laws of any
jurisdiction in accordance with the Plan.

---|---|--- 
   

  

     5.1  |   | Obligations of both parties  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Without limiting the general nature of clauses 3.1 to 3.5, each
party covenants to:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Regulatory Approvals:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | promptly apply for all relevant Regulatory
Approvals specified in clause 3.1(a) and provide to the other a copy of all
those applications;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (2)  |   | take all steps it is responsible for as part of
the approval process, including responding to requests for information at the

agreeing to any limitation; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (3)  |   | provide the other party with all information
reasonably requested in connection with the applications for Regulatory
Approval,  
---|---|---|---

relation to:

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | Warrants and Options:   
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

       | (1)  |   | negotiate in good faith and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to implement arrangements to afford holders of Options
and Warrants the benefits similar to those to which they are
currently entitled in a manner that would be tax-efficient for all the
holders thereof and no less beneficial to Coeur and Palmarejo from a
tax perspective or otherwise, provided that the implementation of
such arrangements does not result in incremental costs to Coeur (other than
professional fees and similar costs associated with the implementation of the
arrangements) or delay the Transaction, and provided further that the Options
and Warrants will not represent a right to receive shares in the capital of
Palmarejo after consummation of the Transaction; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (2)  |   | negotiate in good faith to determine the manner
in which to ensure that the Coeur Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Options and Warrants are not "restricted" securities, as defined under Rule
144 of the 1933 Act and comparable Canadian securities laws; but subject to
the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 of the 1933 Act.  
---|---|---|---

and legal advisors, has determined unanimously that the Transaction is fair

Palmarejo Shareholders that they vote their Palmarejo Shares in favour of the

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (f)  |   | Court direction: apply to the Court for an

premium in excess of 250% of the annual premiums on the date hereof, only as

     12.2  |   | Payment of costs  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | If this agreement is terminated or the Plan is

       | (1)  |   | the non-satisfaction of any conditions precedent
in clauses 3.1(b), 3.1(g), 3.1(i), or 3.1(k) or 3.1(m) provided that,
immediately before the termination or, if the agreement has not been
terminated, when Court approval was due to be sought, no matter has occurred
which would prevent clauses 3.1(a), 3.1(c), 3.1(e), 3.1(f), 3.1(h), 3.1(j),
or 3.1(l) being satisfied;  
---|---|---|---

  ##### 

  

   

       | (5)  |   | Palmarejo breaching its obligations under clause
11;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | Palmarejo must pay to Coeur the Break Fee to compensate
Coeur for the costs and disbursements incurred by Coeur and the time invested
by the management and board of Coeur.  
---|---|---

in clauses 3.1(c), 3.1(f), 3.1(h), 3.1(j), 3.1(l) or 3.1(n) provided that,
immediately before the termination or, if the agreement has not been

being satisfied;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Coeur not using all commercially reasonable endeavours

Palmarejo for the costs and disbursements incurred by Palmarejo and the time
invested by the management and board of Palmarejo.  
---|---|---

by the parties of the kinds referred to in clauses 12.2(a) to 12.2(b) are of
such nature that they cannot accurately be ascertained in advance, the Break
Fee has been agreed as a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the loss
which may be suffered by Palmarejo and Coeur respectively.

---|---|--- 
      
    |   | This clause 12 imposes obligations on Palmarejo only to the

12.2(a) to 12.2(b) and no further claims for damages, fees, expenses or
reimbursements of any kind will be payable by a party which has paid the
Break Fee in connection with the occurrence of any such events
or circumstances; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (b)  |   | the sum of the Break Fee represents the maximum

other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite power and authority to own its assets and conduct its business as
currently owned and conducted. Each of Palmarejo and each of its subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary. Palmarejo
has filed on SEDAR complete and correct copies of its Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws and the certificates of incorporation and by-laws
or comparable organization documents of the subsidiaries of Palmarejo, in
each case as amended to the date of this agreement. Palmarejo is not in
violation of any provision of its Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, and
no Subsidiary of Palmarejo is in violation of any provisions of
its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational
documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Palmarejo Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of Palmarejo
and the ownership or interest therein of Palmarejo is set forth in the Public
Disclosure Documents. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable and are owned by Palmarejo, by another Subsidiary of Palmarejo or
by Palmarejo and another Subsidiary of Palmarejo, free and clear of
all pledges, claims, liens, charges, mortgages, deeds of trust, net profit
interests, net smelter returns, royalties, overriding royalty interests,
other payments out of production, other burdens, security interests and other
encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever held by third parties
(collectively, "Liens"). Except for the capital stock of the subsidiaries of
Palmarejo, Palmarejo does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock
or other ownership interest in any person.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Capitalization. The authorized capital (the "Authorized

this agreement. Except as set forth in the recitals, there are no shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Palmarejo issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of Palmarejo having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which shareholders of Palmarejo must vote. Except as set forth above, as
of the date of this agreement, there are not any options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any
kind (collectively, "Options") to which Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries

or securities convertible or exchangeable for any capital stock or other
equity interests in, Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries or obligating
Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
any such Options. All shares of Palmarejos capital stock that are subject to

of Palmarejo Options and the exercise price and vesting schedule with respect
thereto) and the number of options held by, all holders of Palmarejo Options.

       |   |   | Palmarejo has not agreed to register
any securities under any securities Laws or granted registration rights to
any person or entity. As of the date of this agreement, there are not any
outstanding contractual obligations or other requirements of Palmarejo or any
of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries, or provide funds to or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Palmarejo or any other person. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, there are no stock appreciation
rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements
or commitments based upon the book value, income or any other attribute of
Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries.

    | (d)  |   | Authority; Non-Contravention. Palmarejo has all
requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into this
agreement and, subject to the Shareholder Approval, to consummate the
Transaction and to perform its obligations under this agreement. The
Palmarejo Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee of the
Palmarejo Board (comprised of the independent directors), has approved
this agreement and the Transaction and has resolved to recommend to the
Palmarejo Shareholders that the Palmarejo Shareholders give the Shareholder
Approval. The execution and delivery of this agreement by Palmarejo and the
consummation by Palmarejo of the Transaction have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Palmarejo, subject to the
Shareholder Approval. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Palmarejo
or any of its subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this agreement and,
subject to the Shareholder Approval, the Transaction. This agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Palmarejo and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Palmarejo, enforceable by Coeur against Palmarejo in
accordance with its terms, subject to the availability of equitable remedies
and the enforcement of creditors rights generally. The execution and
delivery of this agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transaction
and compliance with the provisions of this agreement will not, conflict with,
or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of consent, termination,
purchase, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of
any property, rights or benefits under, or result in the imposition of any
additional obligation under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties or assets of Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries under,
(i) the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of Palmarejo or the comparable
organization documents of any of its subsidiaries; (ii) any contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, loan or credit agreement,
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other property agreement,

affected, or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in the following sentence, any Law applicable to Palmarejo or any
of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets. No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or

the Interim Order and the Final Order, (iii) filings with the Director under
the Corporations Act, and (iv) such other consents, approvals,

subsidiaries possesses all certificates, franchises, licenses, permits,
grants, easements, covenants, certificates, orders, authorizations and
approvals issued to or granted by Regulatory Authorities or other third
parties (collectively, "Permits"), including pursuant to any Environmental
Law, necessary to own, lease and/or operate its properties and to conduct its
business as such business is currently conducted or is expected to be
conducted immediately following completion of the Transaction. (i) All such
Permits are validly held by Palmarejo or its subsidiaries, and Palmarejo and
its subsidiaries have  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | complied in all material respects with all terms
and conditions thereof, (ii) none of such Permits will be subject to
suspension, modification, revocation or non-renewal as a result of the
execution and delivery of this agreement or the consummation of the
Transaction, and (iii) since June 30, 2006, neither Palmarejo nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any written notice, notice of violation or probable
violation, notice of revocation, or other written communication from or
on behalf of any Regulatory Authority, alleging (A) any violation of such
Permit, or (B) that Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries requires any Permit
required for its business as such business is currently conducted, that is
not currently held by it.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Publicly Filed Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.
Palmarejo has filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents (including documents incorporated by reference) with the
applicable securities Regulatory Authorities since June 30, 2005 (the "Public
Disclosure Documents"). As of its date, each Public Disclosure Document
complied in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable
securities Laws. None of the Public Disclosure Documents, as of

untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading in
the circumstances.  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Compliance. Except for any conflicts, defaults or
violations that could not, individually or in the aggregate (taking into
account the impact of any cross-defaults), reasonably be expected to result
in a Palmarejo Material Adverse Change, each of Palmarejo and its
subsidiaries has complied with, and is not in conflict with, or in default
(including cross defaults) under or in violation of:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | its articles or other organizational documents

Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Palmarejo, the

contracts which if not so valid and binding would not, individually or in the

to the knowledge of Palmarejo, any other party thereto is in violation of or
in default in respect of, nor has there occurred an event or condition which
with the passage of time or giving of notice (or both) would constitute a
default under or entitle any party to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a

contracts, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be a Palmarejo
Material Adverse Change. No approval or consent of any person is needed in

designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Palmarejo
under applicable Law is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the applicable Law. Such disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Palmarejo
in Palmarejos reports and other filings under applicable Law is accumulated
and communicated to the Palmarejo management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  
      
    | (x)  |   | Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Palmarejo
maintains internal control over financial reporting. Such internal control
over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of Palmarejo and its subsidiaries; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures of Palmarejo and its subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Palmarejo and
its subsidiaries; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the
Palmarejos and its subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on
its financial statements. There are no significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of, or material weaknesses in, Palmarejos internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect its
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
and there is no known fraud that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Palmarejos internal control over financial
reporting. Since June 30, 2005, Palmarejo has received no (x) material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters or (y) expressions of concern from employees of Palmarejo
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.  
      
    | (y)  |   | Up-the-Ladder Reporting. No attorney representing
Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Palmarejo or
any of its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of any Law,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Palmarejo or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to
Palmarejos chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee
designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the board
of directors.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (z)  |   | Stock Exchange Compliance. Palmarejo is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the TSXV and each other stock exchange or
market on which the Palmarejo Shares are listed or posted for trading.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (aa)  |   | No Prohibited Personal Loans. Neither Palmarejo nor
any of its subsidiaries has made, arranged or modified (in any material way)
any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan or otherwise, to any
executive officer or director of Palmarejo or any of its subsidiaries.  
      
    | (bb)  |   | Reporting Status. Palmarejo is a reporting issuer or
its equivalent in each of Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. The
Palmarejo Shares are listed on the TSXV.  
      
    | (cc)  |   | No Cease Trade. Palmarejo is not subject to any cease
trade or other order of any applicable stock exchange or securities
Regulatory Authority and, to the knowledge of Palmarejo, no investigation or
other proceedings involving Palmarejo that may operate to prevent or restrict
trading of any securities of Palmarejo are currently in progress or pending
before any applicable stock exchange or securities Regulatory Authority.

Schedule 3 

   

       |   | Except as disclosed in Coeurs filings made with the SEC
prior to the date hereof:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each
of Coeur and each of its and its significant subsidiaries, as such term is
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the 1933 Act is a corporation,
partnership or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite power and authority to own its assets and conduct
its business as currently owned and conducted. Each of Coeur and each of its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify
individually or in the aggregate has not and would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Coeur Material Adverse Change. Coeur has made available for
review to Palmarejo complete and correct copies of its constating documents
and comparable organization documents of the subsidiaries of Coeur, in each
case as amended to the date of this agreement. Coeur is not in violation of
any provision of its constating documents, and no subsidiary of Coeur is in
violation of any provisions of its comparable organizational documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Coeur Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each subsidiary of Coeur have been validly issued and are
fully paid and non-assessable.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Capitalization. The authorized share capital of Coeur
consists of 500,000,000 Coeur Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Preferred Stock"). At the close of
business on December 31, 2006: (i) 279,054,344 Coeur Shares and no shares of
Preferred Stock were outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, there were options
outstanding for 2,089,650 Coeur Shares and $180 million principal amount of
11/4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 that are convertible into Coeur
Shares. Except as set forth above, there are no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Coeur issued or outstanding. Except as set forth
above, as of December 31, 2006, there are not any options to which Coeur or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound relating
to the issued or unissued capital stock of Coeur or any of its subsidiaries,
or obligating Coeur or any of its subsidiaries to issue, transfer, grant,
sell or pay for or repurchase any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests in, or securities convertible or exchangeable for any capital stock
or other equity interests in, Coeur or any of its subsidiaries or obligating
Coeur or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
any such options. All shares of Coeurs capital stock that are subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instrument pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The issuance and sale of all
of the shares of capital stock described in this §(c) have been in compliance
with all Laws. The weighted average exercise price for outstanding Coeur
stock options at December 31, 2006 is $3.56. Coeur has not agreed to register
any securities under any securities Laws or granted registration rights to
any person or entity. As of the date of this agreement, there are not any
outstanding contractual obligations or other requirements of Coeur or any of
its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of Coeur or any of its subsidiaries, or provide funds to or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any subsidiary of Coeur or any other person. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, there are no stock appreciation rights,
phantom equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
based upon the book value, income or any other attribute of Coeur or any of
its subsidiaries.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (d)  |   | Authority; Non-Contravention. Coeur has all
requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into this
agreement and to consummate the Transaction and to perform its obligations
under this agreement. The Coeur Board has unanimously approved this agreement
and the Transaction. Except for the approval of the Coeur Resolutions by the
Coeur Shareholders at the Coeur Meeting, the execution and delivery of this
agreement by Coeur and the consummation by Coeur of the Transaction have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Coeur.
No other corporate proceedings on the part of Coeur or any of its
subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this agreement and the Transaction.
This agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Coeur and constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of Coeur, enforceable by Palmarejo against
Coeur in accordance with its terms, subject to the availability of equitable
remedies and the enforcement of creditors rights generally. Except as set
forth in §(d) of the Coeur Disclosure Statement, the execution and delivery
of this agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transaction
and compliance with the provisions of this agreement will not, conflict with,
or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of consent, termination,
purchase, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of any
property, rights or benefits under, or result in the imposition of any
additional obligation under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties or assets of Coeur or any of its subsidiaries under, (i)
the constating documents of Coeur or the comparable organization documents of
any of its subsidiaries; (ii) any Contract to which Coeur or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective
properties or assets is bound or affected, or (iii) subject to the
governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence,
any Law applicable to Coeur or any of its subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Coeur Material Adverse
Change. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Regulatory Authority, is required by or with
respect to Coeur or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution
and delivery of this agreement by Coeur or the consummation by Coeur of the
Transaction, except for (i) any approvals required by the Interim Order or
the Final Order, and (ii) the other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings set out in
this agreement. To the extent applicable, the Coeur Board has unanimously
determined that the Transaction will not constitute a change of control
within the meaning of any compensatory or benefit plan, arrangement or
agreement provided or maintained by Coeur or any of its subsidiaries for the
benefit of present or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of
Coeur or its subsidiaries.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Publicly Filed Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.
Coeur has filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including documents incorporated by reference) with the applicable
security Regulatory Authorities since December 31, 2006 (the "Coeur Public
Disclosure Documents"). As of its date, each Coeur Public Disclosure Document
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act, or the Securities Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or 2002, as
applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such Coeur
Public Disclosure Document. None of the Coeur Public Disclosure Documents, as
of their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent that such statements have been modified or superseded by a later-filed
Coeur Public Disclosure Document. The consolidated financial statements of
Coeur included in the Coeur Public Disclosure Documents comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position of   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   |   | Coeur as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).
Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed, reflected or reserved against on
the balance sheet or the notes thereto of Coeur as of December 31, 2006
included in the Coeur Public Disclosure Documents, (ii) as incurred after the
date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and not prohibited by this agreement, or (iii) Coeur does not have
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown,
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due,
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to be a Coeur Material Adverse Change. The books and records of
Coeur and its subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
requirements.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (f)  |   | Information Supplied. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Coeur or its subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Coeur Proxy Statement or any Coeur Information will, at
the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to Coeur Shareholders or the
Coeur Information is included in the Plan Circular, as the case may be, or at
the time of the Coeur Meeting or Plan Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Coeur
Information will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable securities Laws, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Coeur with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by Palmarejo or Bolnisi for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or the Coeur
Information.  
      
    | (g)  |   | Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December
31, 2006 Coeur has conducted, and caused each of its subsidiaries to conduct,
its business only in the ordinary course, and:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | there has not been any event, change, effect
or development (including any decision to implement such a change made by
the board of directors of Coeur or any of its subsidiaries),
which, individually or in the aggregate, has been or would reasonably be
expected to be a Coeur Material Adverse Change;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | there has not been any declaration, setting aside
or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock
or property) with respect to any Coeur Shares;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | there has not been, except as provided for in
this agreement, any split, combination or reclassification of any Coeur
Shares or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any
other securities in exchange or in substitution for Coeur Shares; and  
      
    | (iv)  |   | there has not been any change in accounting
methods, principles or practices by Coeur or any of its subsidiaries
materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except insofar as
may have been required by a change in GAAP.  
   

  

       | (h)  |   | Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no
agreement, judgement, injunction, order or decree binding upon Coeur or any
of its subsidiaries that has, or could reasonably be expected to have, the
effect of prohibiting, restricting or impairing any business practice of
Coeur or any of its subsidiaries, any acquisition of property by Coeur or any
of its subsidiaries or the conduct of business by any of them as currently
conducted (including following the Plan) other than such
agreements, judgements,  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | injunctions, orders or decrees which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, a Coeur Material Adverse Change.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (i)  |   | Title. To the knowledge of Coeur, Coeur has adequate
title to its real property interests, except for failures of title that would
individually or in the aggregate not be a Coeur Material Adverse Change.  
      
    | (j)  |   | Insurance. Coeur and its subsidiaries maintain
insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such
risks as are in accordance with normal industry practice for companies
engaged in businesses similar to that of Coeur and its subsidiaries.  
      
    | (k)  |   | Litigation. There is no suit, action or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of Coeur, threatened against Coeur or any of its
subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to be a Coeur Material Adverse Change, and there is not any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Regulatory Authority
outstanding against Coeur or any of its subsidiaries being, or which would
reasonably be expected to be, a Coeur Material Adverse Change. As of the date
of this agreement, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to
the knowledge of Coeur, threatened, against Coeur or any of its subsidiaries
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the
Transaction.  
      
    | (l)  |   | Determination by the Board. The board of directors of
Coeur has unanimously determined and resolved at its meeting held on May 2,
2007:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | that the entering into of this agreement and the
performance by Coeur of its obligations hereunder and the Transaction are in
the best interests of Coeur and its shareholders;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | to approve the Transaction and this agreement; and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | to recommend that Coeur Shareholders approve the
Coeur Resolutions at the Coeur Meeting.  
   

  

       | (m)  |   | Brokers. Except for CIBC World Markets, no
broker, investment banker, financial advisors or other person is entitled to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Transaction based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Coeur.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (n)  |   | Compliance. Except for any conflicts, defaults or
violations that could not, individually or in the aggregate (taking into
account the impact of any cross-defaults), reasonably be expected to result
in a Coeur Material Adverse Change, Coeur has complied with, and is not in
conflict with, or in default (including cross defaults) under or in violation
of any Law applicable to its business or operations.  
      
    | (o)  |   | Stock Option Pricing. Since January 1, 2000, (A) the
exercise price of each stock option issued by Coeur has been granted at the
Fair Market Value (as defined under the terms of the respective stock
incentive plan under which such option was granted) of a Coeur Share as
determined on the date of grant of such option, and (B) all grants of such
options were validly issued and properly approved by the Coeur Board (or a
duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in material compliance
with applicable Law and recorded in Coeurs financial statements referred to
in §(e) in accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved any "back
dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the effective
date of grant.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (p)  |   | Reserves. Coeur filed with SEDAR on February 22,
2007 at www.sedar.com Technical Reports for each of the Rochester, Cerro
Bayo, Martha, Kensington, Endeavor and Broken Hill projects (the "Coeur
Reserve Reports"). The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the
properties of Coeur and its subsidiaries on which the Coeur Reserve Reports
were based for purposes of estimating the reserves set forth therein, to the
knowledge of Coeur, was accurate in all material respects at the time such
data was provided to the reserve engineers for the Coeur Reserve Reports. The
Coeur Reserve Report conforms to the guidelines with respect thereto of
Canadian National Instrument 43-101.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (q)  |   | Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Coeur has
established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "1934 Act")) to provide reasonable assurance to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by Coeur in the reports that it files or
submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Coeurs management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Coeur required under the 1934 Act with respect to such reports.
Neither Coeur nor its independent auditors have identified any "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in Coeurs or any of its subsidiaries
internal controls as contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.  
      
    | (r)  |   | Rights Agreement. Coeur has taken all action so that
the entering into of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to
any person under Coeurs rights agreement or enable or require any rights
issued pursuant to such agreement to be exercised, distributed or triggered
except for such rights to be provided as part of the Plan Consideration.  
      
    | (s)  |   | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, To Coeurs knowledge,
neither Coeur nor any of its subsidiaries (nor any person representing Coeur
or any of its subsidiaries) has at any time during the last five years while
acting on behalf of Coeur or its subsidiaries (a) made any payment in
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other
countries where Coeur engages in business, or (b) made any payment to
any foreign, federal or state governmental officer or official, or other
person charged with similar public or quasi-public duties, other than
payments required or permitted by the laws of the United States or any
jurisdiction thereof.
