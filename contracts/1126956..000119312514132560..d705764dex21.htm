-iii- This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of April 5,
2014, is made by and among THE LACLEDE GROUP, INC., a Missouri corporation ("
_Purchaser_ "), ENERGEN CORPORATION, an Alabama corporation (" _Seller_ "),
and ALABAMA GAS CORPORATION, an Alabama corporation (the " _Company_ ").

Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Purchaser, all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Shares_ "), of the Company.

Accordingly, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES; CLOSING_

 

Section 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer
and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, the
Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than the restrictions on transfer
of the Shares imposed by Alabama Public Utilities Law, for an
aggregate purchase price of $1,600,000,000 (One Billion Six Hundred Million
Dollars) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), payable as set forth below in Section
1.02 and Section 1.03 and subject to adjustment as provided herein. The
purchase and sale of the Shares and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including, in the case of Purchaser, the Financing, are referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Transactions_ ".

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The purchase and sale of the Shares (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP, 1819
Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, at 10:00 a.m. on the first
Business Day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the
date of satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in Article VII (or, to
the extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits
thereof) other than those conditions which can only be satisfied at Closing,
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing
between Purchaser and Seller. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be
deemed to be effective as of 11:59 p.m., Birmingham, Alabama time on the last
day of the calendar month immediately prior to the calendar month in which
the Closing Date occurs (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.03 _Transactions to Be Effected at the Closing_. At the Closing:

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser certificates representing the Shares,
duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank
in proper form for transfer, with appropriate Transfer Tax stamps, if any,
affixed.

(b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller payment, by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least
one Business Day prior to the Closing Date), in immediately available funds in
an amount equal to the Closing Date Amount.

 



1 (c) Purchaser shall pay the Company Credit Agreement Repayment Amount as
contemplated by Section 6.12(a).

(d) Seller shall, or Seller shall cause the Company to, deliver evidence
satisfactory to Purchaser at the Closing that, effective as of the Closing
Date, each of the officers of the Company listed in Section 1.03(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and the members of the board of directors of the
Company have resigned from (or shall otherwise have ceased to hold) their
positions as officers or directors of the Company.

(e) Seller shall, or Seller shall cause the Company to, deliver to Purchaser
at the Closing valid certificates issued by applicable Governmental Entities
which evidence that each of the Company and Seller is in good standing in its
state of incorporation or organization.

 

(f) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing a certificate executed by
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Seller certifying the resolutions
adopted by the board of directors of Seller with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such other similar certificates as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser.

 

(g) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller at the Closing a certificate executed by
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Purchaser certifying the
resolutions adopted by the board of directors or other governing body of
Purchaser with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such other similar certificates as may be reasonably requested by Seller.

 

Section 1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Not less than two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate which shall set forth
the estimated Closing Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), the estimated Closing
Indebtedness (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and the estimated Closing Working
Capital (" _Estimated Working Capital_ "). The " _Closing Date Amount_ "
shall equal the Purchase Price _plus_ Estimated Cash _minus_ Estimated
Indebtedness _plus_ Estimated Working Capital _minus_ Target Working Capital.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Indebtedness and the Closing
Indebtedness shall include (A) all principal amounts outstanding under the
Company Credit Agreement and the Company Notes at, and all accrued interest
related thereto through, the Effective Time and (B) all prepayment premiums,
fees, expenses, penalties or other similar amounts (other than accrued
interest between the Effective Time and the Closing Date) payable through the
Closing Date in connection with the Company Credit Agreement, in the case
of each of (A) and (B), without giving effect to the payments contemplated by
Section 1.03 or Section 6.12. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Estimated
Working Capital is negative, adding such amount to the Purchase Price will
reduce the Closing Date Amount, and if the Target Working Capital is
negative, subtracting such amount from the Purchase Price will increase the
Closing Date Amount.

 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement (the " _Statement_ "), setting forth (i) Cash as of the
Effective Time (" _Closing Cash_ "), (ii) Working Capital as of the Effective
Time (" _Closing Working Capital_ "), (iii) the outstanding principal and
accrued interest of all Indebtedness as of the Effective Time (but without
giving effect to the repayment of the Company Credit Agreement Repayment
Amount as contemplated by Section 6.12) and all prepayment premiums, fees,
expenses or penalties payable in connection with the repayment of the
Indebtedness to be repaid pursuant to Section 6.12(a) and Section 6.12(b) ("
_Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (iv) the Net Adjustment Amount.

 



2 (c) During the 30-day period following SellerÂ’s receipt of the Statement,
Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review the working
papers relating to the Statement. The Statement shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless Seller
gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser on or prior to such date, _provided_ , that if
such date is not a Business Day, on or prior to the first Business Day
following such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature and amount, if reasonably available, of any disagreement so
asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is given by Seller in a timely manner,
then the Statement shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser
on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period,
Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review the
working papers prepared in connection with SellerÂ’s preparation of the Notice
of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall
submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for
arbitration any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be Ernst and
Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by the parties hereto in writing. Seller and Purchaser agree to use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving
the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days following such
submission. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be based upon, and made in accordance with, the provisions of this
Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this
Section 1.04 shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by
the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined
by the Accounting Firm at the time its determination on the merits of the
matters submitted is rendered. The fees and disbursements of SellerÂ’s
independent auditors incurred in connection with their review of the
Statement and any Notice of Disagreement and of SellerÂ’s attorneys in
connection with the arbitration shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and
disbursements of PurchaserÂ’s independent auditors incurred in connection with
their review of the Statement and any Notice of Disagreement and of
PurchaserÂ’s attorneys in connection with the arbitration shall be borne by
Purchaser.

 

(d) _Net Adjustment Amount_.

 

(i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Purchaser shall, within 10
Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties,
pay to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds the Net
Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate
of interest from time to time announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

 



3 (ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller shall, within 10
Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties,
pay to Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available funds the absolute
value of the Net Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon at a rate
equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the
date of payment.

 

(e) For purposes of determining the Net Adjustment Amount, any action taken by
Purchaser subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to the accounting books
and records of the Company on which the Statement is to be based that is not
consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practices shall be disregarded; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit the requirement
that Cash, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Indebtedness and Working
Capital be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, any changes made in any reserve or
other account existing as of the date of the Audited Balance Sheet except as
a result of events occurring after the date of the Audited Balance Sheet and
in a manner consistent with past practices shall be disregarded; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit the requirement
that Cash, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Indebtedness and Working
Capital be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. In
addition, any change resulting from the consummation of the Transactions,
including, without limitation, any purchase price accounting adjustment, shall
be disregarded. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated
by this Section 1.04, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Company to
afford, to Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained
by Seller in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase
Price contemplated by this Section 1.04 reasonable access during normal
business hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records
of the Company relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this Section 1.04;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may withhold any document or
information that is prohibited from being disclosed under the terms of a
confidentiality obligation to a third party or is subject to attorney client
privilege.

 

(f) For the purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) The term " _Cash_ " means the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the
Company, as determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles, _plus_
any amounts paid by the Company pursuant to Section 6.11(b) hereof prior to
the Closing.

(ii) The term " _Current Assets_ " means the current assets of the Company,

Assets, (3) any amounts relating to the policy obtained by the Company
pursuant to Section 6.11(b) hereof shall be excluded from the definition of
Current Assets, and (4) prepaid Federal income tax and state income tax shall
be excluded from the definition of Current Assets. For the avoidance of doubt,
to the extent outstanding checks are reflected as (or result in) a reduction
to Cash, any current asset being reduced (but only to the extent it is being
reduced) by such checks shall be excluded from the definition of Current
Assets.

 



4 (iii) The term " _Current Liabilities_ " means the current liabilities of
the Company, as determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the purpose of determining Current
Liabilities, (1) Indebtedness shall be excluded from the definition of Current

from the definition of Current Liabilities, (3) any liabilities relating to
the obligations contained in Section 6.11(b) hereof shall be excluded from the
definition of Current Liabilities, (4) the fees and expenses to be paid in
accordance with Section 6.13 shall be excluded from the definition of Current
Liabilities, (5) current liabilities that are offset by non-current regulatory
assets or insurance receivables in the CompanyÂ’s financial statements shall
be excluded from the definition of Current Liabilities, and (6) accrued
Federal income tax payable and state income tax payable shall be excluded from
the definition of Current Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent outstanding checks are reflected as (or result in) a reduction to Cash,
any current liability being paid (but only to the extent it is being paid) by
such checks shall be excluded from the definition of Current Liabilities.

(iv) The term " _Indebtedness_ " means (1) all obligations of the Company
for borrowed money evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures or similar
instruments and (2) accrued interest to the Effective Time, in each case as
determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles. For the avoidance of
doubt, " _Indebtedness_ " does not include non-current "Deferred Credits and
Other Liabilities" as reflected in the CompanyÂ’s financial statements.

 

(v) The term " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means (1) the amount (if any) by
which Estimated Cash is less than Closing Cash  _minus_ (2) the amount (if
any) by which Closing Cash is less than Estimated Cash _minus_ (3) the amount
(if any) by which Estimated Indebtedness is less than Closing Indebtedness

practices, assumptions, policies and methodologies used by the Company in the
preparation of the Company Financial Statements, as modified by the provisions
of Section 1.04(f) hereof, including with respect to the matters addressed by
the sample calculations referenced in Section 1.04(f)(v). The provisions
of this Section 1.04(g) are referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Accounting Principles_ ".

ARTICLE VI

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

Section 6.01 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Except to the extent (and only to such extent) prohibited by applicable
Law, from and after the date hereof until Closing, the Company shall afford
to PurchaserÂ’s officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives, access to senior executives of the Company to
answer PurchaserÂ’s questions concerning the business, operations,
financial performance, records, plants, offices and other owned or leased
facilities of the Company and access (including for inspection and copying) to
the CompanyÂ’s properties, books, contracts and records, in each case as
reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case, such access shall be given at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice, and Purchaser shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or personnel of
the Company (it being agreed that such access shall in no way include any
Phase II environmental investigation or other invasive procedure or
investigation, including any sampling, testing or removal of materials from
the offices or properties of the Company). Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may withhold (i) any document or
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party or attorney-client privilege or (ii) such portions of documents
or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive
if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as
determined by the CompanyÂ’s counsel, prior to the receipt of the HSR
Approval, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for the Company or
its affiliates. If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the
Company to, inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being
withheld, and the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to,
cooperate in seeking a way to allow disclosure of such material to the extent
doing so would not violate any such third-party confidentiality agreement or
attorney-client privilege. All information provided by the Company

 



28  pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement, dated January 21, 2014, between Seller and Purchaser, as amended
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and shall be deemed "Evaluation
Material" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.01(a), all requests for
access shall be made to such representatives of the Company or Seller as
Seller shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all
such requests and access thereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
not, directly or indirectly, contact or communicate with (i) any Governmental
Entity concerning environmental matters relating to the Company or any real
property presently or heretofore owned or leased by the Company or (ii) any
current or former owners or occupants of any such real property respecting
any such matters, without in each case first obtaining the consent of Seller
in writing.

Section 6.02  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) _Required Actions_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each of Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including:

(i) obtaining in the most expeditious manner practicable all necessary
actions or nonactions, Consents, Governmental Authorizations and Orders
(including with respect to the HSR Approval and the Required Regulatory
Approvals, but subject to Section 6.02(b) and Section 6.02(c), as applicable)
from Governmental Entities in connection with the authorization, execution,
delivery, performance and consummation of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the Transactions;

 

(ii) vigorously defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
regulatory, judicial, administrative or other, to which it is a party
challenging or affecting this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the
Transactions (including all regulatory proceedings necessary or advisable in
connection with obtaining the HSR Approval and the Required Regulatory
Approvals) or seeking to prohibit or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or rescind, vacate, or otherwise challenge any Orders granted;

(iii) seeking to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order
which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transactions;

 

(iv) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 90 days after the
date hereof or such later date as Seller and Purchaser may agree, making or
causing to be made all necessary notifications, applications and filings
(including with respect to the HSR Approval and the Required Regulatory
Approvals), and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any
fees due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and the Transactions required under or with respect to the
HSR Approval and the Required Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller, the Company and

 



29  Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required in connection with the Transactions (including with
respect to the HSR Approval and the Required Regulatory Approvals) and seeking
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings;

 

(v) Seller using its reasonable best efforts, including paying reasonable
consent fees, if necessary, to obtain the amendments contemplated by Section
7.03(c) in such a form as would satisfy the condition contained in Section
7.03(c); and

(vi) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

(b)  _HSR Approval_. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to
take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be
made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with the
termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act at the
earliest possible date (the " _HSR Approval_ "), so as to enable the Closing
to occur as promptly as practicable, including agreeing to conditions imposed
by, or taking any action required by, any Governmental Entity, in each case as
may be required in order to obtain the HSR Approval or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be required to, and Seller and the Company shall not, in
connection with obtaining the HSR Approval, consent to or take any action with
respect to the Transactions, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Purchaser, taken
as a whole (including, for this purpose, assuming its ownership of the Company
following the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, none of the exclusions set
forth in the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed
to apply to any reference to "material adverse effect" in this Section
6.02(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller and the Company shall not be required to, and Purchaser
shall not, in connection with obtaining the HSR Approval, consent to (x) the
taking of any action or the imposition of any terms, conditions, limitations
or standards of service the effectiveness or consummation of which is not
conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing or (y) the imposition of any
terms, conditions or limitations on or with respect to Seller, any of its
affiliates (other than the Company), any of their respective businesses or
any of the benefits to Seller and its affiliates (other than the Company) of
the Transactions.

(c) _Required Regulatory Approvals_. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser agrees to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make,
or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection
with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals applicable to Purchaser or
the Company, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable,
including agreeing to conditions imposed by, or taking any action required
by, any Governmental Entity, in each case as may be required in order to
obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals or to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would

 



30  otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not be required to, and Seller and the Company shall not, in
connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals, consent to or
take any action with respect to the Company, in each case, that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the exclusions set forth in the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed to apply to any reference to "material
adverse effect" in this Section 6.02(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and the Company shall not
be required to, and Purchaser shall not, in connection with obtaining the
Required Regulatory Approvals, consent to (x) the taking of any action or the
imposition of any terms, conditions, limitations or standards of service the
effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditional upon the occurrence
of the Closing or (y) the imposition of any terms, conditions or limitations
on or with respect to Seller, any of its affiliates (other than the Company),
any of their respective businesses or any of the benefits to Seller and its
affiliates (other than the Company) of the Transactions.

(d) _Cooperation_. Without limiting the generality of anything contained in
this Section 6.02, each party hereto shall: (i) jointly coordinate the
overall development of the positions to be taken and the regulatory actions to
be requested in any applications and filings for approval of the matters
contemplated by this Agreement which require regulatory approval and of all
other regulatory matters incidental thereto which are to be addressed in such
applications and filings; (ii) furnish to each other all information required
for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the Transactions; (iii) promptly inform the
other parties and provide copies to such parties of any communication to or
from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions; (iv) give the
other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; and (v) keep the other
parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding, subject in each case to such
limitations and exceptions to the foregoing as each party deems prudent based
upon the advice of its antitrust counsel. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Transactions. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party shall not be deemed to have breached this covenant if (A) such
party uses efforts reasonable under the circumstances to contact the other
party or its representatives, but is nonetheless unable to reach the other
party or its representatives prior to the time at which such Governmental
Entity proposes to conduct such meeting or discussion, or (B) any such
designated representatives are unable to participate in such meeting at such
proposed time. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay
of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent
of the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. No party to this Agreement, directly

 



31  or indirectly through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take
any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other business organization or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VII.
Nothing in this Section 6.02 will apply to or restrict communications or
other actions by the Company with or with respect to any Governmental Entity
in connection with its business in the ordinary course of business.

 

(e) _Control of Company Operations Prior to Closing_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the Closing, but the
foregoing shall not be interpreted to limit any consent or other rights of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

 

Section 6.03 _Notification_. Until the Closing, each of Seller and the Company
shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice
to Seller and the Company, of (i) the breach or failure to be true and correct
of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to be true and correct would give rise to the failure
of a condition in Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.03(a), as
applicable, or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement. 

Section 6.04 _Public Announcements_. Subject to Section 6.18, any public
announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as
mutually agreed to by Seller and Purchaser; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit any party from making, issuing or releasing
any announcements, statements or acknowledgments that such party is required
to make, issue or release by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with
or listing rules of a securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer
quotation system (provided that such party has used reasonable efforts to
give the other party prior notice thereof to review such disclosure).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may issue a press release with the
prior approval of the other party (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). Subject to Section 6.18, except as otherwise agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser or required by Law, prior to the Closing, each party and its
representatives and agents will keep this Agreement and any information about
the Transactions strictly confidential and shall not make any disclosure of
this Agreement to any other person. Seller and Purchaser will consult with
each other concerning the means by which the Company, employees, customers,
and suppliers and others having dealings with the Company will be informed of
the Transactions.

Section 6.05 _Benefits_.

 

(a) At or prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the Energen Corporation
Retirement Income Plan, including its related trust, (" _Seller Retirement
Income Plan_ "), and the Energen Corporation Dental Expense Benefit Plan, the
Energen Corporation Group Life Insurance Plan, the Energen Corporation
Disability Plan, the Energen Corporation Retiree 

 



32  Welfare Plan, the Energen Corporation Retired Salaried Employee Group Life
Insurance Plan, and the Energen Corporation Flexible Benefit Plan, including
the related trusts or other funding vehicle of each (collectively, " _Seller
Welfare Plans_ "), each to be split into two separate groups of plans, one
group (the plan being split from the Seller Retirement Income Plan being
referred to as the " _Company Retirement Income Plan_ ," and the remainder of
such plans being split off being referred to as the " _Company Welfare Plans_
") (collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "), respectively, for the
benefit of Company Personnel and other Company Covered Individuals, and one
for the benefit of other current and former employees of Seller and its
subsidiaries (excluding the Company) and their respective covered
beneficiaries (each, a " _Seller Benefit Plan_ " and, collectively, the "
_Seller Benefit Plans_ "), and shall cause the Company to assume sponsorship
of the Company Benefit Plans. With respect to the split of the Seller
Retirement Income Plan, the assets related to such plan will be allocated
between the Seller Retirement Income Plan and the Company Retirement Income
Plan in accordance with Section 4044 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder.
With respect to the split of the Energen Corporation Retiree Welfare Plan,
the assets related to such plan (including those in the related trusts for
such plan), will be allocated pro rata between the Energen Corporation Retiree
Welfare Plan and the Company Welfare Plan being created for purposes of
splitting the Energen Corporation Retiree Welfare Plan in proportion to the
underlying benefit obligations of such plans resulting from the split. Neither
Purchaser or the Company nor any of their affiliates shall assume or have any
liability with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan.

(b) For a period of three years following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
maintain or cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to maintain
without material alteration the Defined Benefit Plans, the Disability Plan and
the Post-Retirement Health Plan. Other than with respect to employees who are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement (the benefits of such employees
being pursuant to such collective bargaining agreements), until the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Purchaser shall maintain, or
cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to maintain, for the benefit of
the employees of the Company as of the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ "),
employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements that provide comparable
compensation and benefits in the aggregate as those provided in the Benefit
Plans, the Benefit Agreements and the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior
to the Closing Date (other than equity-based compensation and non-qualified
deferred compensation). Purchaser shall provide each Company Employee who is
terminated during the twelve-month period immediately following the Closing
Date with severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than
those disclosed in Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall create
any right in any employee to continued employment by Seller, the Company,
Purchaser or any respective subsidiary of any thereof, or preclude the ability
of Seller, the Company, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary of any thereof
to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason.

(c) Purchaser and Seller will enter into an agreement acceptable to the
Trustees of both the transferor and transferee plans involved that will
provide for a plan-to-plan transfer of the benefits and associated assets of
specified participants in the Energen Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to a similar 401(k) plan maintained by Purchaser or
one of its affiliates, including the Company. The participants whose accounts
will be transferred pursuant to the terms of such agreement are Company
employees, persons who 

 



33  were employees of the Company or shared services employees of the Seller or
any of its affiliates at the time of their separation from employment with the
Seller and its affiliates, and persons who derive their rights to benefits
under such plan from any of the foregoing persons. Such plan-to-plan transfer
shall (i) provide for the transfer of the Seller common stock and participant
loans held in the accounts of the participants whose benefits in the Seller
401(k) Plan are transferred to the PurchaserÂ’s plan, such loans to remain
outstanding and payable in accordance with their terms and (ii) permit the
Seller common stock transferred to be held in the PurchaserÂ’s plan for a
period of at least twenty-four months following the transfer. Purchaser shall
also be required to permit, and to cause the Company to permit, all employees
of the Company to become participants in PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan effective
as of the Closing, including by way of offering a special enrollment date.

(d) At or prior to Closing, Seller shall transfer to a flexible benefits plan
that is qualified under Section 125 of the Code and that shall be maintained
by Company for non-collectively bargained Company Employees as of the Closing
Date (the " _Company Flex Plan_ "), in cash, any health care and dependent
care balances standing to the credit of such Company Employees under the
Energen Corporation Flexible Benefits Plan (the " _Other Flex Plan_ ") as of
the date of such transfer, and the Company shall reimburse such
Company Employees for all eligible health and dependent care expenses
submitted on or after the date of such transfer. The Company Flex Plan shall
continue the salary reduction elections made by non-collectively bargained
Company Employees as in effect prior to the date of transfer for the
remainder of the applicable plan year.

(e) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company)
to, cause any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained by Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries (including the Company) (including any vacation, paid time-off
and severance plans) to recognize each Company EmployeeÂ’s service with the
Company (as well as service with any predecessor of the Company or with Seller
or any affiliate of Seller, to the extent service with any such entity
is recognized by the Company), for all purposes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits provided in any of the other
employee benefit plans sponsored by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries.

(f) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the
Company) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company) to,
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-
payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing Date.

 



34 (g) Following the Closing, the Company shall, and the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to, comply in all respects with the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ "), and any similar
state or local law which is applicable. For a period following the Closing
equal to the longest prior notification period under the WARN Act and any
similar state or local law which is applicable, the Company shall not, and the
Purchaser shall cause the Company to not, effect any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" within the meaning of the WARN Act or any similar event proscribed or
regulated by any similar state or local law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall create any right in any employee to
continued employment by Seller, the Company, Purchaser or any respective
subsidiary thereof, or preclude the ability of Seller, the Company, Purchaser
or any respective subsidiary thereof to terminate the employment of any
employee for any reason. This Section 6.05(g) shall be binding upon and shall
inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this Section 6.05(g), express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Section 6.05(g) or is intended to be, shall constitute or
be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan,
program, arrangement or policy of Seller, the Company, Purchaser or
any respective subsidiary thereof. No Company Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.05(g),
and this Section 6.05(g) shall not create such rights in any such person.

(h) Purchaser shall be solely liable for the obligation to provide
continuation coverage to any "qualified beneficiary" of the Company as of the
Closing Date (as such term is defined in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ "), Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-3, and other applicable guidance) to any individual who is a
qualified beneficiary as of the Closing Date on account of a qualifying event
that occurred in connection with the termination of a shared service employee
of the Company, Seller and any affiliated employer; to any individual who is
a qualified beneficiary on account of a qualifying event that occurred before
the Closing Date in connection with the termination of (i) an employee of the
Company or (ii) a shared service employee of the Company, Seller and any
affiliated employer, whose election period with respect to COBRA continuation
coverage has not expired as of the Closing Date; to any qualified beneficiary
with respect to the Transactions; and to any shared service employee of the
Company, Seller and any affiliated employer whose employment is terminated
prior to or in connection with the Transactions and is entitled to COBRA
continuation coverage.

 

(i) Purchaser shall assume at the Closing the obligations of Seller under the
Severance Compensation Agreements disclosed in Section 6.05(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and shall deliver to Seller at the Closing an instrument of
assumption thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller.

 

(j) The Company shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, pay cash
incentives with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing of the
Transactions occurs in accordance with the procedures therefor provided in
Section 6.05(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



35 (k) Seller and Purchaser shall each cooperate with the other and shall provide
to the other such documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably
necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 6.05.

 

Section 6.06 _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes incurred in connection
with the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Purchaser. To
the extent applicable Law requires Seller to pay any Transfer Taxes, Purchaser
shall promptly reimburse Seller for such Transfer Taxes. 

Section 6.07 _Tax Election_.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall join in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding equivalent elections under
state or local law, including an election under the equivalent to Section
338(g) of the Code in those jurisdictions where an election under Section
338(h)(10) is not permitted) (collectively, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_
") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares to treat such purchase
and sale as a deemed purchase and sale of assets for federal income Tax and
state income and or franchise Tax purposes. In connection with the Section
338(h)(10) Election, each of Seller and Purchaser will duly execute, or cause
to be executed, IRS Form 8023 (and any comparable form required for purposes
of making such elections under state Law) and shall deliver such forms to
the other party before or at the Closing. If any changes are required in
these forms as a result of information which is first available after these
forms are prepared, the parties will promptly agree on such changes and
execute and deliver updated forms to each other. Seller shall include in
SellerÂ’s income Tax Returns for the taxable period that includes the Closing
Date, and Purchaser shall include in PurchaserÂ’s income Tax Returns, or shall
cause the Company to include in its income Tax Returns, for the taxable
period that includes the day after the Closing Date, any forms that are
required to be so included on account of the Section 338(h)(10) Election
including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8883 (and any comparable forms
required to make such election under state Law). Seller shall include any
income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election on SellerÂ’s Tax Returns to the extent required
by applicable law. Seller shall also pay any Taxes imposed on the Company
attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including any
state, local or non-U.S. Tax imposed on the CompanyÂ’s gain. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate fully, and in good faith, with each other in making
the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(b) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the parties agree
that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company (plus other
relevant items) will be allocated to the assets of the Company for Tax and
financial accounting purposes in the manner determined by Purchaser in its
reasonable discretion, provided, however, that the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to the CompanyÂ’s fixed assets shall not be greater than the
fair market value of the fixed assets as of the Effective Time, also as
determined by Purchaser in its reasonable discretion. Purchaser shall provide
Seller with a copy of such allocation within one hundred twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date, and Seller shall have the right to review
and comment on the allocation. Purchaser shall make changes to the allocation
reasonably requested by Seller in writing within thirty (30) days after Seller
receives a copy of the allocation from Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller shall
file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation. The

 



36  parties shall exchange mutually acceptable Internal Revenue Service forms
(and any equivalent local, state and foreign tax forms) reflecting such
allocations which are to be filed with the IRS and/or any applicable state,
local or foreign Tax authority.

(c) Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for any additional Tax owed by
Seller (including Tax owed by Seller due to this indemnification payment)
resulting from any transaction engaged in by the Company not in the ordinary
course of business occurring on the Closing Date after PurchaserÂ’s purchase of
the Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, "any transaction" in the previous
sentence does not include the aforementioned Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

Section 6.08 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed, taking into account valid extensions of time within which to
file, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the
Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. Subject to Section 6.08(b), Purchaser shall prepare all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the Company.

 

(b) In the case of any Tax Return that is due after the Closing Date, that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an indemnity claim under Section
9.01(d) (or under Section 9.01(b) with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 2.07 or Section 3.09), Purchaser shall
prepare all such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past custom
and practice of the Company. Seller shall have the right to review, comment
on and make changes to each such Tax Return. Purchaser shall thereafter
execute and timely file each such Tax Return and timely remit such Taxes, and
Purchaser shall then be entitled to file any applicable indemnity claims
under Section 9.01(d) (or under Section 9.01(b) with respect to a breach of
any representation or warranty in Section 2.07 or Section 3.09).

 

Section 6.09 _Assistance and Cooperation_. To the extent reasonably requested
by Seller or Purchaser, after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall
(and shall cause their respective affiliates to) (i) assist the other party in
preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing
and filing in accordance with Section 6.08, and (ii) cooperate fully in
preparing for any audits of, or disputes with any Tax authority regarding, any
Tax Returns of the Company. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other partyÂ’s request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The Company and Seller agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority.

 

Section 6.10 _Computation of Tax Liabilities_. To the extent allowable or
required by Law, any applicable taxable period of the Company which includes
the Closing Date shall be treated as closing at the Effective Time. For
purposes of Section 9.01(d), with respect to Taxes of

 



37  a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately preceding
sentence as closing at the Effective Time), Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time shall be computed (a) in the
case of Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) imposed on a periodic
basis, based on the number of days of the Straddle Period that are in the
period ending at the Effective Time and (b) in the case of all other Taxes,
as if such taxable period ended at the Effective Time.

Section 6.11 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, cause the Company to honor all the CompanyÂ’s obligations to
indemnify (including all obligations to advance funds for expenses) the
current or former directors or officers of the Company for acts or omissions
by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Closing Date to the
extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall
survive the Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with the current terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
and such individual indemnity agreements from the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions. Section 6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all
indemnification obligations of the Company other than such obligations under
the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium
for the extension of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability coverage of the
CompanyÂ’s existing and former directors and officers, for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Closing Date with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing
Date, which extension policy shall be primary insurance with respect to the
Company, and shall be in the form negotiated by Seller with SellerÂ’s existing
insurance carrier (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with the terms,
conditions, retentions, limits of liability and coverages provided under
SellerÂ’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a current or former director or officer of the
Company by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided,_
that if Seller is unable to negotiate such an extension policy with SellerÂ’s
existing carrier, Purchaser shall cause the Company as of the Closing Date
to obtain and fully pay the premium for an extension of the directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability coverage of the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six years from and after the Closing Date with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing Date, which extension
policy shall be primary with respect to the Company, from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the CompanyÂ’s, as the case may be,
current insurance carrier with respect to the DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous
than the coverage provided under the CompanyÂ’s existing policies with respect
to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a current or
former director or officer of the Company by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that

 



38  existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company pay, or Purchaser
be required to reimburse Company for, more than the amount specified in
Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter for such six-year extension
of the DandO Insurance. In the event of a Claim covered under the six-year
extension of the DandO Insurance, satisfaction of the corporate retention shall
be the obligation of Purchaser or the Company.

 

Section 6.12 _Indebtedness_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay, by wire transfer
of cash in immediately available funds pursuant to written instructions and
amounts specified by Seller in a written notice to be provided by Seller to
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date to the
administrative agent under the Company Credit Agreement or any Indebtedness
incurred to refinance or replace the Company Credit Agreement (the " _Company
Credit Agreement Repayment Amount_ "), for the account of the lenders of such
Indebtedness immediately following the Closing against delivery by such
administrative agent of documentation in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, evidencing the release as of the Closing of (i) the Company from
its obligations under such Indebtedness and (ii) the Liens created by such
Indebtedness and related security agreements on the Company and all
collateral owned by the Company, if any. For income tax purposes, the parties
agree to report the transaction occurring pursuant to the preceding sentence
as follows: Immediately prior to the Closing, (x) Purchaser shall be treated
as paying the Company Credit Agreement Repayment Amount to Seller as part of
the Purchase Price as contemplated by Section 1.03(c) of this Agreement, (y)
Seller shall then be treated as making a capital contribution to the Company
in the amount of the Company Credit Agreement Repayment Amount and (z) the
Company shall then be treated as paying the Company Credit Agreement Repayment
Amount to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders of such
Indebtedness.

(b) Within five Business Days (for purposes of this Section 6.12(b) only, as
defined in the AIG Note Purchase Agreement, in the case of the AIG Notes, and
in the Prudential Purchase Agreement, in the case of the Prudential Notes)
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to,
(i) give written notice of the consummation of the Transactions to the
holders of the CompanyÂ’s 3.86% senior secured notes due December 22, 2021 (the
" _AIG Notes_ "), make an offer to prepay the AIG Notes not less than ten nor
more than 30 days following the date of such offer as provided in Section 8.3
of the Note Purchase Agreement dated December 22, 2011, between the Company
and certain affiliates of American International Group, Inc. (the " _AIG Note
Purchase Agreement_ "), and thereafter prepay each AIG Note validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to such offer, in each case in accordance with the
provisions of the AIG Note Purchase Agreement and (ii) give written notice of
the consummation of the Transactions to the holders of the CompanyÂ’s 3.86%
senior secured notes due December 22, 2021 (the " _Prudential Notes_ " and
together with the AIG Notes, the " _Company Notes_ "), make an offer to
prepay the Prudential Notes not less than ten nor more than 30 days following
the date of such offer as provided in Section 8.3 of the Note Purchase
Agreement dated December 22, 2011, between the Company and The
Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain of its affiliates (the "
_Prudential Note Purchase Agreement_ "), and thereafter prepay each Prudential
Note validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to such offer, in each 

 



39  case in accordance with the provisions of the Prudential Note Purchase
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, this Section 6.12(b)
shall only apply to the extent the AIG Notes and the Prudential Notes remain
outstanding after the Closing.

Section 6.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses; provided, that all
filing fees and expenses (except expenses of legal counsel of each of Seller
and the Company) payable in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals
shall be paid by Purchaser, whether or not the Closing occurs.

 

Section 6.14 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at the
Closing a certificate, duly completed and executed, certifying that it is not
a foreign person. Such certificate shall be substantially in the form of the
sample set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 

Section 6.15 _Insurance_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Company shall not be entitled to coverage
under any insurance policies maintained by Seller or its affiliates (other
than directly by the Company) from and after the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall provide recovery to the Company in accordance with the
terms of the Company Insurance Policies, or any other historical
insurance policy, (at no cost to Seller or any of its affiliates) retained
from a third-party to insure the Company for any claims made or Losses
incurred prior to the Closing Date that relate to the Company if such claim
was reported or made against the Company Insurance Policies or such other
insurance policies prior to the Closing or if the Company Insurance Policies
or such other insurance policies (at no cost to Seller or any of its
affiliates) permit the Company to pursue such claim after the Closing even if
it was not reported or made prior to the Closing (such claim and Losses,
collectively, the " _Recoverable Insurance Claims_ "). To the extent any
Recoverable Insurance Claim is subject to indemnification by Seller
under Article IX of this Agreement, in accordance with Section 9.06(b), any
payment by Seller under Article IX shall be net of any payments received by
the Company pursuant to the Company Insurance Policies or such other insurance
policies.

 

(b) In the ordinary course the Company reports, and through Closing the
Company will continue to report, to the CompanyÂ’s insurance carriers
potential or actual claims of which it is aware and which it evaluates as
having a reasonable possibility of exceeding applicable retentions or
deductibles and having a potential insurance recovery. In addition, prior to
Closing, Seller shall notify the carriers of Company Insurance Policies (in
accordance with such policies) of the actual and potential claims and
incidents reasonably known to the Company in the ordinary course of business
that could be insurable.

 

Section 6.16 _Settlement of Intercompany Notes; Affiliate Transactions_.
Seller shall take (or cause to be taken) all action necessary such that (i)
all intercompany loans for borrowed money between and among the Company, on
the one hand, and Seller and SellerÂ’s subsidiaries (other than the Company),
on the other hand, shall be eliminated (which may include the netting of
receivables and payables, contributions to equity and dividends) and (ii)
except as disclosed in Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter or as
provided in Section 3.09(m), all Contracts by and between Seller or
its affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand, and the

 



40  Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated, in each case, prior to the
Closing, provided, that such Contracts will be determined to have terminated
prior to the determination of Cash, Indebtedness, Current Assets and Current
Liabilities for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price, and without any
consideration or further liability on the part of the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Intercompany payables for shared services and
employees and allocations of overhead items will be settled in the normal
course or as part of the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount.

 

Section 6.17 _Concerning Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Letter (as may be amended in accordance
with the terms below), after giving effect to the market flex terms in the Fee
Letter, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to
(other than to amend the Financing Letter to add lenders, co-agents, lead
arrangers or similar entities who have not executed the Financing Letter as of
the date hereof or to reassign titles), or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Financing Letter or the Fee Letter, if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or
(ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or
other terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or
prevent the Closing, (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letter or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto, other than a waiver of any closing conditions by
the lead arrangers, lenders or agents; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall have
the right to substitute other financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such substitution shall only be permitted if (A) the terms
thereof would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or
make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing less likely to occur and (B) the conditions to the
Financing set forth in the Financing Letter would not be expanded or modified
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing;
_provided_ , _still further_ , that any such substitute financing shall not
obligate any of Seller or its affiliates (including the Company) as a surety,
guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any person. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall have the right to reduce the
Financing to the extent Purchaser actually raises additional capital (whether
debt or equity). Any reference in this Agreement to (1) "Financing," shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letter as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 6.17(a) and (2) "Financing Letter,"
and "Fee Letter" shall include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.17(a).

 

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect
the Financing Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (ii) to negotiate and enter into all definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Financing Letter, including the market flex provisions in the Fee Letter, and
(iii) to satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements and consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall keep Seller
reasonably apprised of the status of the Financing and developments with
respect thereto (including giving Seller prompt notice of

 



41  any material change with respect to such Financing) and shall provide to
Seller copies of all material definitive documents relating to the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify
Seller promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any time (x)
the Financing Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (y) any of
the other parties to the Financing Letter notify Purchaser that such party no
longer intends to provide financing on the terms set forth therein or (z) to
PurchaserÂ’s knowledge (without a requirement of due inquiry), any of the other
parties to the Financing Letter is or is alleged to be in breach or default
thereunder.

(c) To the extent necessary to complete the transactions contemplated hereby,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the parties
providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the other transactions
contemplated by the Financing Letter, including by taking enforcement action,
if all conditions in the Financing Letter and all conditions to Closing
contained in this Agreement are satisfied or waived, or upon funding will be
satisfied.

 

(d) If the Financing Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner
materially adverse to Purchaser or Seller, if the Financing Letter shall be
materially breached or repudiated by the other parties to the Financing
Letter, or if any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Financing Letter (other than as a result of
obtaining substitute debt financing in accordance with Section 6.17(a)) (such
event, an " _Original Financing Failure_ "), Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange promptly to obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources on terms and conditions not less favorable to
Purchaser or Seller than those contained in the Financing Letter and the Fee
Letter and in an amount at least equal to the Financing or such unavailable
portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") and to
obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate
Financing (the " _New Financing Letter_ "), which shall replace the existing
Financing Letter; _provided_ , that any such Alternate Financing shall not
obligate any of Seller or its affiliates (including the Company) as a surety,
guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any person (the terms described
in this proviso, " _Prohibited Alternate Terms_ "). Purchaser shall not
execute a New Financing Letter or consummate any Alternate Financing, without
the written consent of Seller, if (i) the terms of the New Financing Letter or
Alternate Financing are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Seller than the
Financing Letter or the Financing (without giving effect to the Original
Financing Failure), (ii) the terms thereof would be reasonably expected to
delay or prevent the Closing or make the timely funding of the Alternate
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Alternate
Financing less likely to occur, as compared to the Financing Letter and the
Financing (without giving effect to the Original Financing Failure), or (iii)
the conditions to the Alternate Financing set forth in the New Financing
Letter would be expanded or modified in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing, as compared to the Financing Letter
and the Financing (without giving effect to the Original Financing Failure).
Purchaser shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of such New
Financing Letter to Seller. In the event any New Financing Letter is obtained,
(i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall mean the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letter as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letter"
shall be deemed to include the Financing Letter that is not superseded by a
New Financing Letter at the time in question and the New Financing Letter to
the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to

 



42  "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating to
the Financing Letter that is not superseded by a New Financing Letter at the
time in question and the New Financing Letter to the extent then in effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, with
the consent of Seller, Purchaser shall be entitled to pursue substitute
financing, the terms of which may differ from the terms set forth in the
Financing Letter and such substitute financing may not constitute Alternate
Financing. No actions taken by Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection therewith shall in and of itself constitute a
breach of the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

(f) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the CompanyÂ’s
obligations under Section 6.18(a), none of the obtaining of the Financing or
any alternative financing or the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing are a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms
its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently
of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing or the
completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02.

 

Section 6.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.18, the term "Financing" shall include any
Permanent Financing (as defined in the Financing Letter), whether for debt,
equity or otherwise. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company to, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective officers, directors accountants, attorneys, agents
and representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") to, provide to
Purchaser such cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with the Financing or the Alternate Financing, including (to the extent
reasonably requested and reasonably required):

(i) participating in a customary and reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings or conference calls with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, underwriters, initial purchasers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and senior management and
representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and
sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;

 

(ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, lender and investor presentations, registration
statements, prospectuses (registered or otherwise) and similar documents and
materials for the Financing, including execution and delivery of customary
representation letters in connection with an audit of the Company, auditors
comfort letter, and bank information memoranda;

(iii) furnishing Purchaser and its Financing Sources with financial and other
information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser
(including in connection with PurchaserÂ’s preparation of pro forma financial
statements), including, without limitation, unaudited interim financial
statements, financial data, projections, audit reports and other information
of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K

 



43  under the Securities Act for a registered public offering, and of type and
form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, to consummate the offering(s) of debt or equity securities
contemplated by the Financing, or as otherwise reasonably required in
connection with the Financing, or as otherwise necessary in order to assist in
receiving customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from
independent accountants in connection with the offering(s) of debt or equity
securities contemplated by the Financing, and reasonable and customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and investors and containing customary
information (all such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required
Information_ ");

 

(iv) providing information relating to the Company that is reasonably
available to it to assist Purchaser in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, any credit agreement, indentures, underwriting agreements,
purchase agreements, currency or interest hedging arrangements, other
definitive financing documents, officerÂ’s certificates, customary closing
documents, or other certificates or documents with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser
(including customary consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Financing);

(v) furnishing Purchaser and its Financing Sources as promptly as practicable
all financial information required to be delivered pursuant to the Financing
Letter and monthly financial statements for the Company (to the extent
prepared in the ordinary course of business); and

 

(vi) taking all corporate actions, contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Purchaser that are necessary or customary to
permit the consummation of the Financing;

_provided_ , that (A) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would require Seller or any of its affiliates to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement, incur any liabilities, pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses, in each case, with respect to the Financing, prior to the Closing
for which it has not received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of
Purchaser, or would cause Seller or any of its affiliates (including the
Company) to breach this Agreement or become unable to satisfy a condition to
the Closing, (B) nothing herein shall require such cooperation from Seller or
its affiliates to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller or its affiliates and (C) there shall be no action,
liability or obligation of Seller or its affiliates (including the Company,
except for any actions, liabilities or obligations required or effective only
after the Closing which do not require obtaining prior to Closing approvals by
any Regulatory Entity) under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document
or instrument relating to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.18, neither Seller nor any of its affiliates
(including the Company) shall be in breach of the covenant set forth in this
Section 6.18 if it has acted in good faith to comply with the cooperation and
assistance set forth herein.

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify each of the SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons from,
against and in respect of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by, or asserted against, any of them, directly or indirectly relating
to, arising out of or resulting from the arrangement of the Financing, any
other financing and/or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, which obligation
shall

 



44  continue after the Closing Date, except to the extent such Losses arise from
circumstances in which such SellerÂ’s Indemnified Person is finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to willingly and knowingly have
committed fraud with specific intent to deceive.

(c) Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to update Required
Information provided to Purchaser pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of
Section 6.18(a) as may be necessary such that the Required Information does
not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

Section 6.19 _Access to, and Disposition of, Records_. In addition to the
rights of Seller to inspect records contained in Article IX of this
Agreement, Purchaser agrees, that, except as may otherwise be required by law,
for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, to preserve and protect,
and to cause the Company to preserve and protect, for at least as long as
would be required under the policies applicable to the CompanyÂ’s books and
records immediately prior to the Closing, or in the event either Purchaser or
the Company wishes to destroy or discard such items prior to the required time
such items are required to be preserved, offer to surrender to Seller, all
books and records of the Company relating to the corporate organization of the
Company and all other books and records of any of them relating to the
operation of the Company prior to the Closing Date, and in furtherance of the
common interest of Seller and the Company (and without in any way waiving any
of the privileges) described in Section 6.20 hereof, to afford to the
officers, employees and authorized representatives of Seller, reasonably free
and full access for legitimate business purposes during normal business hours
to such books and records; and Purchaser and the Company further agree that
such officers, employees and authorized representatives of Seller shall be
free during such period, to make copies of and to take notes from such books
and records at SellerÂ’s expense.

Section 6.20  _Conflicts and Privilege_. Purchaser and the Company agree and
acknowledge that they shall not seek to cause Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP
(or any of its current or former partners or employees) to reveal to the
Purchaser, the Company or any other person any information obtained in
connection with such firmÂ’s representation of the Company prior to the Closing
and protected by the attorney-client privilege of the Company where such
information is being sought in anticipation of, or in connection with, any
dispute or potential dispute between the Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser and the Company on the other, including, without limitation, any
dispute arising out of this Agreement, absent a written authorization
signed by Seller. Purchaser and the Company each acknowledge and agree that
Seller will be entitled to retain the services of Bradley Arant Boult Cummings
LLP as its attorneys in the event of any dispute between Purchaser or the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or its affiliates (other than the
Company), on the other hand, concerning this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein or otherwise involving the Company,
notwithstanding such firmÂ’s prior representation of the Company, and the
Purchaser and the Seller each hereby waive any conflict of interest presented
by such representation. Purchaser, the Company and Seller agree that there
existed prior to the Closing a common interest between the Company
and Seller, which common interest will continue subsequent to the Closing, in
the files generated and maintained by Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP in
connection with such firmÂ’s representation of the Company prior to the
Closing. Accordingly, the Purchaser and the Company agree that subsequent to
the Closing Date the Seller may have access to such files, and

 



45  may consult with the partners and employees and former partners and
employees of Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP having knowledge of such files
and the related matters with respect to such files and such matters without
in any way waiving any attorney-client communication, attorney work-product,
or any other privileges. Seller hereby waives any conflicts of interest which
may be presented by Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLPÂ’s representation of the
Company after the Closing Date with respect to matters for which such firm was
providing representation to the Company prior to the Closing Date.

following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to,
provide to Seller and its affiliates such of the services currently provided
by the Company to Seller and its affiliates as Seller may request, which
services are to be provided in substantially the same manner and at the
same level as such services are presently provided by the Company, and Seller
and its affiliates shall reimburse the Company for such services at the same
rate, on the same terms and conditions, and at the same frequency, as Seller
and its affiliates presently reimburse the Company.

Section 6.22 _Use of Trade Names, Trademarks, etc_. No later than 180 days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cease using any names, marks, trade
names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating "Energen" or
"Energen Corporation" (collectively and together with all other names, marks,
trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos owned by Seller or
any of its affiliates other than the Company, the " _Seller Marks_ ") and
shall remove from any assets owned by the Company any and all Seller Marks.
Thereafter, except as required by Law or with the prior written consent of
Seller, Purchaser shall not use, and shall cause the Company not to use, any
Seller Mark or any name or term confusingly similar to any Seller Mark (i) in
connection with the sale of any products or services by Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective affiliates, (ii) in the corporate or doing
business name of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective affiliates,
or (iii) otherwise in the conduct of any businesses or operations by
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective affiliates.

Section 6.23 _Non-Solicitation_. For a period of twenty-four (24) months
after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not
to, without the prior written approval of Purchaser, directly or indirectly,
solicit, encourage, entice or induce any employee of the Company to terminate
his or her employment with the Company; provided, however, that such
prohibition shall not apply to any person who responds to a general
solicitation that is not directed to the employees of the Company. For a
period of twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, neither Purchaser
nor the Company shall, and each of Purchaser and the Company shall cause their
respective affiliates not to, without the prior written approval of Seller,
directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage, entice or induce any employee of
Seller to terminate his or her employment with Seller; provided, however, that
such prohibition shall not apply to any person who responds to a general
solicitation that is not directed to the employees of Seller.

all of which shall survive such termination, and except to

 



50  the extent that such termination results from a knowing and intentional
breach by a party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed to
release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel
specific performance by any other party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 8.03 and Section
8.02, Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.10 and Section 10.11 (in each
case, together with any related defined terms as they affect such Section)

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.01 _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its affiliates (including the
Company) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (" _Purchaser Â’s Indemnified
Persons_") from and against, and shall reimburse PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified
Persons for, any and all Losses directly arising out of or based upon:

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement;

 

(b) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company set forth in this
Agreement; and

(d) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) (i) of the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Effective Time and, with respect to any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Effective Time (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Effective Time (determined in accordance with the principles of
Section 6.10), but in each case only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
accrual or reserve for Taxes taken into account in computing the Working
Capital or (ii) attributable to any entity other than the Company but imposed
on the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of any Tax Laws).

 



51 Section 9.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents
and representatives (" _Seller Â’s Indemnified Persons_") from and against, and
shall reimburse Seller for, any and all Losses directly arising out of or
based upon:

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement; and

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Purchaser or, after the Closing, the Company set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.03 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which any party to
this Agreement may have an obligation to indemnify another party to this
Agreement, the party asserting such right to indemnity (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give the party from whom indemnity is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice thereof within 10 Business Days after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim, but any
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five
Business DaysÂ’ time after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; provided
that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense
but the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such participation or otherwise in connection with the defense
of such claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or
ceasing to defend against such claim (with such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall 

 



52  agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim and imposes no other restrictions on
the Indemnified Party.

 

(e) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
claim as provided in this Section 9.03 with respect to which such
Indemnifying Party has an obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (other than during any period in
which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above), and the Indemnifying Party will promptly
reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this Section
9.03. The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required by this Section
9.03 shall be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigations or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses
incurred.

Section 9.04 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party in writing with reasonable promptness, setting forth
specifically the obligation with respect to which the claim is made, the facts
giving rise to and the alleged basis for such claim and, if known or
reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the liability asserted or which may be
asserted by reason thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event the Indemnifying Party disputes
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article IX, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days after receipt of notice under this
Section 9.04 to give written notice of such objection, and the grounds
therefor, and the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have 30 days to respond
in writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such 30-day
period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall attempt
in good faith for 30 days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to such indemnification obligation. 

Section 9.05 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of each party contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the date that is
12 months after the Closing Date, at which time such representations and
warranties shall terminate and thereafter be of no force and effect; provided,
that (i) the Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing
indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
2.07 and Section 3.09 shall survive the Closing until 60 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claim for indemnity
under Section 9.01(a) and Section 9.01(b) or Section 9.02(a) must be asserted
in writing prior to the relevant date listed above. Any claim for

 



53  indemnity for a breach of a covenant or agreement of a party contained in
this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing must be asserted in
writing prior to the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date. Each
covenant and agreement of each party contained in this Agreement to be
performed after the Closing shall survive in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), a partyÂ’s rights to indemnification under
this Article IX, and the other provisions of this Article IX, shall not
terminate with respect to any claim with respect to which the Indemnified
Party has delivered a written notice to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
relevant survival date set forth in Section 9.05(a), alleging in good faith a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or other right to
indemnification and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for
indemnification, the facts upon which the claim for indemnification is based
and an estimate in reasonable detail of the Losses incurred in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or right to indemnification under this Article
IX shall survive only until, and only for purposes of, the resolution of the
matter covered by such notice.

Section 9.06 _Indemnification Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) Other than (i) with respect to Losses attributable to breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in the Fundamental
Representations, (ii) with respect to Losses attributable to breaches or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed after the Closing,
(iii) with respect to Losses attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of
any covenant, agreement or other obligation set forth in Section 6.15, (iv)
with respect to Losses arising under Section 9.01(d) or (v) with respect to
circumstances in which Seller is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have willfully and knowingly committed fraud against Purchaser
with specific intent to deceive and mislead Purchaser regarding the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article II and Article
III of this Agreement: (w) neither PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons nor
SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons may assert any claim for Losses under Section
9.01 or Section 9.02, as applicable, (A) except to the extent that any such
claim is in an amount in excess of $100,000 (the " _Claim Threshold_ "), and
(B) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims by such
PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons or SellerÂ’s Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, under this Agreement exceeds $15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Dollars)
(the " _Deductible_ "), and then PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons or SellerÂ’s
Indemnified Persons, as applicable, may assert claims only for the excess of
such aggregate claims over the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , neither
the Claim Threshold nor the Deductible shall apply to claims for
indemnification arising under Section 9.01(b) (with respect to Losses
attributable to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.09), and (x) in no event shall the aggregate liability of Seller for
all claims of Losses under Section 9.01 exceed $25,000,000 (Twenty-Five
Million Dollars). The aggregate amount of Losses for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified by Seller for any claim for
indemnification under Section 9.01 shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(b) The Indemnified Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnified Persons are entitled or may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX, and no Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses to the extent arising from
such Indemnified PersonÂ’s failure to 

 



54  mitigate such Losses. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is
provided for under this Article IX shall be (i) offset by any amounts
recovered by the Indemnified Persons as a result of any indemnification by
any third party and any insurance proceeds or other amounts received by the
Indemnified Persons from third parties with respect to such Losses, (ii)
reduced to take account of any tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss, in each case on a
"with and without" basis and (iii) reduced by any amounts recovered, to be
recovered or recoverable over time through any rate order issued by the
Alabama Public Service Commission (including pursuant to general provisions of
any rate order, tariff or mechanism applicable to the Company). Purchaser and
Seller agree to (and agree to cause the other Indemnified Persons to)

indemnification available from any third party and/or pursue and comply with
any rate order or any general rate order, tariff or mechanism with respect to
Losses for which any Indemnified Person will or may seek indemnification
hereunder and to diligently pursue such claims in good faith. If any such
insurance proceeds and/or other amounts are received and/or authorized for
deferred accounting by any PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Person after receipt of
any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX, Purchaser shall
promptly repay to Seller such portion of such indemnification payment equal to
the amounts so recovered or realized.

 

(c) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 9.01 or Section 9.02
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by a final determination (which shall include the
execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form).

 

(d) The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a liability in
calculating Working Capital shall be calculated net of the amount so
included. The amount of the Loss arising out of any reduction in value of any
Current Asset acquired at the Closing shall be calculated net of the reported

PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article IX for any Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected in Closing
Indebtedness or in Closing Working Capital.

PurchaserÂ’s Indemnified Persons nor the SellerÂ’s Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX with respect to any losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses that are in the nature of punitive,
consequential, special, treble or indirect damages or damages based on any
multiple, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or
income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity (in each case, except to
the extent payable to third parties), in each case of any kind or nature,
regardless of the form of action through which any of the foregoing are
sought.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges and covenants to, and agrees with, Seller, that
Purchaser, as of the date of this Agreement, has no Knowledge of any facts or
circumstances that would serve as the basis for a claim by any Purchaser
Indemnified Person against Seller based upon a breach of any of
the representations and warranties of Seller or the Company contained in this
Agreement. Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived, and hereby does waive, in
full any breach of representations and warranties of Seller or the Company of
which Purchaser has Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement.

 



55 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no PurchaserÂ’s
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX
with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Seller or the Company attributable to an event occurring or a matter arising
after the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of events or matters that
are based on SellerÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, such events or matters that
first come to SellerÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge after the date hereof), only
if all of the following occur: (i) Seller provides written notice to
Purchaser prior to the Closing, describing such breach or inaccuracy, (ii) as
a result of such breach or inaccuracy, a condition contained in Section
7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.02(e), would not be satisfied, (iii)
Seller simultaneously and irrevocably informs Purchaser in writing that
Purchaser is not required to consummate the Transactions and (iv) the Closing
occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.06(g), if
the Closing would otherwise occur at a time within three (3) Business Days of
the last notice provided by Seller under sub-clause (i) above, Purchaser shall
have the unilateral right to extend the Closing by not more than three (3)
Business Days after the date on which Purchaser last receives any such notice,
and, if such extension would cause the Closing to occur after the Outside
Date, to extend the Outside Date by an equal amount of time.

(h) For purposes of determining the Loss attributable to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the terms "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect," "Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect," "material adverse effect," "material" or other terms of a similar
nature, to the extent contained in such representation or warranty, shall be
given no effect and shall be disregarded in their entirety.

 

Section 9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Except (i) as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, (ii) with
respect to Losses attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement to be performed after the Closing, (iii) with respect to Losses
attributable to breaches or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation set forth in Section 6.15(a) or Section 6.16, (iv) with respect to

and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, the Company or any of its
assets and liabilities shall, in each case, be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and in no event
shall Seller have any right to contribution, subrogation or other recovery
from the Company with respect to any Losses of a Purchaser Indemnified Person
to be paid by Seller pursuant to this Article IX. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against
Seller, and Seller hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against Purchaser or the
Company, in each case arising under or based upon this Agreement, any document
or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law or
Judgment (including any rights of contribution or recovery under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or any
analogous state law, or any Environmental Law), common law or otherwise except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX.

 



56 (b) After the Closing, no party may bring any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to rescind the Transactions or this Agreement, whether based on

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance; Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Consent to
Service of Process_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which money damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to
be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically

 



64  the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any state or Federal court
sitting in Birmingham, Alabama, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of Seller, the Company or Purchaser
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.10 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction, and the party opposing such injunction or injunctions
hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount or absence of any such
bond or other security requested or offered by the party seeking such
injunction or injunctions. Each of the parties further agrees that (i) the
seeking of any remedies pursuant to this Section 10.10 shall not in any
way constitute a waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this
Agreement, including under Section 8.02 in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 10.10 are not available or otherwise not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this Agreement shall require a party to institute any proceeding (or
limit a partyÂ’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance

against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), or if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), (ii) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (iii) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any manner provided by law and
(iv) agrees that the laws of the State of New York shall govern any such
action.

 

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING OR
ANY CLAIM OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES.

Section 10.12 _Purchaser Acknowledgement_.

 

(a) Purchaser is knowledgeable about the business engaged in by the Company
and of the usual and customary practices of companies engaged in businesses
similar to such business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II and Article III,
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller and
the Company to Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, and there are
no other representations, warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements,
oral or written, in relation thereto between the parties other than those
incorporated therein. Except for the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in Article II and Article III, Purchaser disclaims reliance on any
representations or warranties, either express or implied, by or on behalf of
Seller or the Company or their affiliates or representatives.

(b) Purchaser represents that it is a sophisticated party. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial forecasts or projections relating
to the Company prepared by or on behalf of the Company or Seller have been
provided to Purchaser with the understanding and agreement that neither the
Company nor Seller is making any representation or warranty with respect to
such forecasts or projections and that actual future results may vary from
such forecasts or projections based upon numerous factors.

 

Section 10.13 _Affiliate Liability_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement, each party hereto covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document shall be had against any partyÂ’s

 



66  Related Parties, in each case other than the parties to this Agreement and
each Ancillary Document and each of their respective successors and permitted
assignees under this Agreement (and, in the case of any Ancillary Document,
the applicable parties thereto and each of their respective successors and
permitted assigns), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being
expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall
attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the Related
Parties, as such, for any obligation or liability of any party under this
Agreement, the Financing, or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection herewith for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations or liabilities or their creation; provided, however, nothing in
this Section 10.13 shall relieve or otherwise limit the liability of any
party hereto or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns, for
any breach or violation of its obligations under such agreements, documents or
instruments. For the avoidance of doubt, except as permitted by Section
10.10, prior to the Closing, none of Seller, the Company or any of their
affiliates on the one hand and Purchaser or any of its affiliates, on the
other hand, will have any recourse, be entitled to commence any action or
make any claim under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby except against Purchaser
on the one hand and Seller and the Company on the other hand, as applicable.
The liability limitation provision in this Section 10.13 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.
