                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "AGREEMENT") is entered into as of
August 12, 2004 by and among Avid Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"BUYER"), Maui Paradise Corporation, a California corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the "TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY"), Maui LLC, a single member
Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer
(the "BUYER LLC"), and Midiman, Inc., a California corporation doing business as
M-Audio (the "COMPANY").

     This Agreement contemplates a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary with and
into the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "MERGER"),
pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company will receive cash and common
stock of the Buyer in exchange for their shares of capital stock of the Company.
The Merger then shall be followed, as soon as reasonably practicable, by a
merger of the Surviving Corporation with and into the Buyer LLC (the "FINAL
MERGER"). It is the intention of the Parties that the Merger be mutually
interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Final Merger and that the
Final Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by Section 4.11, be
effected, as soon as reasonably practicable, following the Effective Time and
without the further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the
Parties or the Buyer LLC. It is the further intention of the Parties that, upon
consummation of the Merger and the Final Merger, there will be achieved a single
end result and the shareholders of the Company at the Effective Time will
receive the same economic benefit and/or ownership interest in the Buyer as such
shareholders of the Company would have received had the Company been merged
directly with and into the Buyer LLC.

     The Parties intend that the Merger and the Final Merger, considered
together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax
purposes, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

     Certain defined terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article IX
hereof.

     Now, therefore, in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     1.1    THE MERGER. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company at
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 1107 of the California General Corporation Law.

     1.2    THE CLOSING. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in Boston, Massachusetts, commencing at

     1.3    ACTIONS AT THE CLOSING. At the Closing:

            (c)    the Surviving Corporation shall file the Merger Filings with
the Secretary of State of the State of California;

            (d)    the Buyer shall deliver the cash component of the Initial Per
Share Consideration and certificates for the shares of Buyer Common Stock
included in the Initial Per Share Consideration to the Company Shareholders that
deliver Certificates at the Closing in accordance with Section 1.7 (provided
that Buyer shall retain in trust for the benefit of holders of Certificates any
Initial Per Share Consideration payable with respect to Certificates that are
not properly surrendered at the Closing and shall not be obligated to pay any
cash or shares of Buyer Common Stock deliverable with respect to such
Certificates until such Certificates are properly surrendered pursuant to
Section 1.7);

            (e)    the Buyer, the Indemnification Representatives and the Escrow
Agent shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreements and the Buyer shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Merger Consideration being placed in
escrow on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.11; and

            (f)    the Company shall deliver to the Buyer true and correct
schedules of all Transaction Expenses and the amounts of any filing fees paid
under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

     1.4    ADDITIONAL ACTION. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after
the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the Transitory
Subsidiary, necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

     1.5    CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any of the
following securities:

            (a)    Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Common Shares owned beneficially by the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive (subject to the provisions of Section 1.5(e) and
Section 1.11) the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration payable with respect to such Common Share as described in Section
1.10. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
cash portion of the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration shall be reduced and
(ii) the

                                        2
<Page>

Buyer Common Stock portion of the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration shall
be increased, in each case by the same amount, with the additional Buyer Common
Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock Value, to the extent necessary to satisfy
the Stock Consideration Requirement (which measurement of Stock Consideration
Requirement shall be made in accordance with the definition thereof).

            (b)    Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares owned beneficially by the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into and represent the right to receive (subject to the provisions of Section
1.5(e) and Section 1.11) the Per Share Preferred Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration payable with respect to such Preferred Share as described in
Section 1.10.

            (c)    Subject to Section 1.15, each holder of Common Shares shall
receive the Initial Per Share Upfront Common Consideration deliverable with
respect to such Common Shares by the Buyer's delivery of (i) such holder's pro
rata share of the Upfront Common Cash Consideration based on the number of
Common Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time as a
percentage of the total Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the balance of the Initial Per Share Upfront Common
Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock
Value.

            (d)    Subject to Section 1.15, each holder of Preferred Shares
shall receive the Initial Per Share Preferred Consideration deliverable with
respect to such Preferred Shares by the Buyer's delivery of (i) such holder's
pro rata share of the Upfront Preferred Cash Consideration based on the number
of Preferred Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
as a percentage of the total Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the balance of the Initial Per Share Preferred
Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock valued at the Buyer Common Stock
Value.

            (e)    The "UPFRONT MERGER CONSIDERATION" shall consist of the
Upfront Common Consideration payable to the Common Shareholders upon conversion
of the Common Shares and the Total Preferred Consideration payable to the
Preferred Shareholders upon conversion of the Preferred Shares pursuant to
Section 1.5(a) and Section 1.5(b) above. The "ESCROW MERGER CONSIDERATION" shall
consist of (i) shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock
Value of $11,250,000 (the "GENERAL ESCROW MERGER CONSIDERATION"), of which
shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of
$3,136,500 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Preferred Shares (the "PREFERRED GENERAL ESCROW CONTRIBUTION") and
shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common Stock Value of
$8,113,500 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of the Common Shares (the "COMMON GENERAL ESCROW CONTRIBUTION"); and
(ii) additional shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate Buyer Common
Stock Value of $2,650,000 shall be withheld from the Upfront Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of the Common Shares (the "TAX ESCROW
MERGER CONSIDERATION"). The Common General Escrow Consideration shall be
withheld from the Common Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount
of the Upfront Common Consideration to be received by each such Common
Shareholder as a percentage of the total

                                        4
<Page>

Upfront Common Consideration to be received by all Common Shareholders. The
Preferred General Escrow Contribution shall be withheld from the Preferred
Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount of the Total Preferred
Consideration to be received by each such holder of Preferred Shares as a
percentage of the Total Preferred Consideration. The Tax Escrow Merger
Consideration shall be withheld from the Upfront Common Consideration to be
received by the Common Shareholders on a pro rata basis based upon the amount of
Upfront Common Consideration to be received by each such holder as a percentage
of the total Upfront Common Consideration to be received by all such Common
Shareholders. The Escrow Merger Consideration shall be deposited into escrow
pursuant to Section 1.11 and each Escrow Agreement shall provide for the
establishment of sub escrow accounts for each Company Shareholder participating
in such Escrow Agreement, which sub escrow account shall be based upon the pro
rata percentage of each participant's initial interest in the applicable Escrow
Merger Consideration (the "SUB ESCROW ACCOUNTS"). The Escrow Merger
Consideration shall be held and disposed of in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreements. In the event some or all of the Escrow Merger Consideration
is sold pursuant to the Escrow Agreements, all references herein to Escrow
Merger Consideration shall mean and include the replacement cash proceeds from
sales of such Escrow Merger Consideration. Subject to the preceding sentence,
each Indemnifying Shareholder shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to
sell shares of Buyer Common Stock held pursuant to the Escrow Agreements in the
manner and amounts as described in the Escrow Agreements. The holders of the
Common Shares shall be entitled to receive the remaining Per Share Upfront
Common Consideration into which each Common Share was converted pursuant to this
Section 1.5 (the "INITIAL PER SHARE UPFRONT COMMON CONSIDERATION") and the
holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive the remaining Per
Share Preferred Consideration into which such Preferred Share was converted
pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "INITIAL PER SHARE PREFERRED CONSIDERATION"
and, together with the Initial Per Share Upfront Common Consideration, shall be
referred to as the "INITIAL PER SHARE CONSIDERATION").

            (f)    Each share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the
Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of common stock,
no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

                                        4

     1.6    DISSENTING SHARES.

            (a)    Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive, in the case of Common Shares, the Per Share Upfront Common
Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such Common
Share and, in the case of Preferred Shares, the Per Share Preferred
Consideration and the Earnout Consideration payable with respect to such
Preferred Share, unless such Company Shareholder's right to appraisal shall have
ceased in accordance with Section 1309 of the California General Corporation
Law. If such Company Shareholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its
right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (i) as of the occurrence of such
event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, in the case of
Common Shares, the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration payable with respect to such Common Share and, in the case of
Preferred Shares, the Per Share Preferred Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration payable with respect to such Preferred Share, and (ii) following
the occurrence of such event, upon proper surrender of the Certificate in
accordance with Section 1.7 the Buyer shall deliver to such Company Shareholder
the Initial Per Share Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.5.

            (b)    The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the California General Corporation Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

     1.7    EXCHANGE OF SHARES.

            (a)    If any Certificates are not delivered at the Closing, as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time and not later than five business days
following the Closing the Buyer shall send a notice and a transmittal form to
each holder of any Certificate that was not delivered at the Closing, advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for
surrendering such Certificate in exchange for the Initial Per Share
Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5. Each holder of a Certificate,
upon proper surrender thereof to the Buyer at the Closing or in accordance with
the instructions in such notice, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (subject to any Taxes required to be withheld) the applicable Initial
Per Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5 for each Company
Share evidenced thereby. Until properly surrendered, each such Certificate shall
be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the applicable
Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5 for each
Company Share evidenced thereby. Holders of Certificates shall not be entitled
to receive the Initial Per Share Consideration to which they would otherwise be
entitled until such Certificates are properly surrendered.

            (b)    If any Initial Per Share Consideration is to be delivered to
a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it

                                        5
<Page>

shall be a condition to the delivery of the Initial Per Share Consideration that
(i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be properly
assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such
transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person requesting such transfer
shall pay to the Buyer any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the
foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have
been paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Party shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Initial Per Share
Consideration deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5 that are
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

            (c)    In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Buyer shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Initial Per Share
Consideration deliverable in exchange therefor pursuant to Section 1.5. The
Buyer may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give
the Buyer a bond in such sum as it may direct (not to exceed the amount of the
Initial Per Share Consideration deliverable in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Buyer with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

            (d)    No dividends or other distributions that are payable to the
holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as of a date on or after the Closing
Date shall be paid to former Company Shareholders entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive Initial Per Share Consideration until such holders surrender
their Certificates for the Initial Per Share Consideration. Upon such surrender,
the Buyer shall pay or deliver to the persons in whose name the certificates
representing shares of Buyer Common Stock are issued any dividends or other
distributions that are payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as
of a date on or after the Closing Date and which were paid or delivered between
the Effective Time and the time of such surrender; provided that no such person
shall be entitled to receive any interest on such dividends or other
distributions.

     1.8    FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued to former Company Shareholders upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such persons shall not be
entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions
or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to such
persons. In lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have
otherwise been issued, each person that would have been entitled to receive a
fractional share of Buyer Common Stock shall, upon proper surrender of such
person's Certificates, receive a cash payment equal to the Buyer Common Stock
Value of such fractional share of Buyer Common Stock.

     1.9    OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND RESTRICTED STOCK.

            (b)    Immediately after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding
at the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire such
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common
Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to
be rounded down to the nearest whole number). In addition, the number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock subject to each such Option shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(iii), and if such Option is exercised prior to the
Earnout Distribution Date the holder of such Option shall receive the right to
receive distributions, if any, pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(ii). The exercise
price per share of each such assumed Option shall be equal to the exercise price
of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). All other terms and
conditions of the Options (including the term, exercisability and vesting
schedule of the Options) shall remain unchanged.

            (c)    As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Options appropriate
notices setting forth such holders" rights pursuant to such Options, as amended
by this Section 1.9, and the agreements evidencing such Options shall continue
in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the amendments provided
for in this Section 1.9 and such notice).

            (d)    The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of any Options assumed in accordance with this Section
1.9. The Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor
form) under the Securities Act with the SEC with respect to all shares of Buyer
Common Stock subject to such Options that may be registered on a Form S-8 within
the later of (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing and (ii) 15 calendar days
after the delivery of all required information from the Company (including
without limitation all required financial statements). The Buyer shall use its
Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement for so long as such Options remain outstanding.

            (e)    The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent
from each holder of an Option to the amendment of such Option pursuant to this
Section 1.9 (unless such consent is not required under the terms of the
applicable agreement, instrument or plan).

            (f)    Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver amendments to each outstanding Warrant, in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT A, providing that (i) such Warrants shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time, (ii) the holders of such Warrants shall have
no further rights thereto after the Effective Time and (iii) such Warrants shall
not be exercised prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

            (g)    As of the Effective Time, all repurchase rights held by the

restricted stock shall be assigned to the Buyer and shall continue in full force
and effect.

            (iii)  CARRY-FORWARD EARNOUT.

                   1. If the Gross Profits of the Business Unit during Fiscal
                   2005 are less than $34,000,000 and the Gross Profits of the

                   or greater than $61,000,000 plus 50% of the Earnout
                   Shortfall, the Common Earnout Holders shall be entitled to
                   receive, in accordance with and subject to Section 1.10(f),
                   additional consideration of $19,000,000, less any amounts
                   previously paid to the Common Earnout Holders pursuant to
                   Section 1.10(a)(i).

                   2. If the Gross Profits of the Business Unit during Fiscal
                   2005 are less than $32,500,000 and the Gross Profits of the

            For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the

            (b)    All Earnout Consideration, if any, to which the Earnout

distributed on or before April 30, 2005 (the actual date of such distribution,
the "FIRST EARNOUT DISTRIBUTION DATE") in accordance with and subject to Section
1.10(f), and all Earnout Consideration, if any, to which the Earnout Holders are
entitled for the Second Earnout Period pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) and
Section 1.10(a)(iii), shall be distributed on or before March 31, 2006 (the
actual date of such distribution, the "SECOND EARNOUT DISTRIBUTION DATE") in
accordance with and subject to Section 1.10(f).

            (c)    The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver

Second Earnout Period, as the case may be, the Earnout Representatives shall
have the right, at the expense of the Earnout Holders, and upon not less than 10
days' prior notice to the Buyer, to meet with the Buyer and the Buyer's
independent auditors to discuss the Buyer's calculation of the Gross Profits of
the Business Unit for such period and have reasonable access during normal
business hours to inspect the records and working papers relating to the
calculation of such Gross Profits of the Business Unit solely for the purpose of
verifying the calculation of the Gross Profits of the Business Unit for the
applicable Earnout Period.

                                        9
<Page>

            (d)    Unless the Earnout Representatives shall, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 1.10(e) below, challenge the Buyer's determination of
the Gross Profits of the Business Unit for Fiscal 2005 or the Second Earnout
Period, as applicable, within 30 days after the delivery of the Buyer's
calculation thereof, the Buyer's determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Earnout Holders.

            (e)    In the event that the Earnout Representatives dispute the
calculation of the Gross Profits of the Business Unit for Fiscal 2005 or the
Second Earnout Period, as applicable, the Earnout Representatives shall notify
the Buyer in writing by delivery of an Earnout Dispute Notice within 30 days
after delivery of the Buyer's calculation of the Gross Profits of the Business
Unit for Fiscal 2005 or the Second Earnout Period, as applicable, which Earnout
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute.
In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the Earnout Representatives shall
first use diligent good faith efforts to resolve such dispute among themselves.
If they are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the delivery of
such Earnout Dispute Notice, then the dispute shall be submitted to the Earnout
Arbitrator for determination in accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect
from time to time and the following provisions:

                   (i)    In the event of any conflict between the Commercial
Rules in effect from time to time and the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

                   (ii)   Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the
arbitration hearing, the Earnout Arbitrator shall prepare and distribute to the
parties a writing setting forth the Gross Profits of the Business Unit for
Fiscal 2005 or the Second Earnout Period, as applicable, and the Earnout
Arbitrator's reasons therefor. Any decision rendered by the Earnout Arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon
may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to
Section 10.11).

                   (iii)  The Earnout Arbitrator shall have no power or
authority, under the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard
any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section
1.10(e), or (y) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties.

                   (iv)   The fees and expenses of the Earnout Arbitrator in
connection with the resolutions of disputes pursuant to this Section 1.10(e)
shall be shared equally by the Earnout Holders on the one hand and the Buyer on
the other hand, provided that, if the Earnout Arbitrator determines that one
party has adopted a position(s) that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the
Earnout Arbitrator may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of such fees
and expenses to such party.

                   (v)    Within 15 days of the resolution of any dispute, the
Buyer shall make any additional payment of Earnout Consideration determined by
the Earnout Arbitrator.

            (f)    The Buyer shall deliver the Earnout Consideration to the
Earnout Holders as follows:

                                       10
<Page>

                   (i)    The holder of each Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Shares owned
beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares)
shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be
delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on the applicable Earnout Distribution
Date as is obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Earnout Consideration
distributable to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio by (y) the Earnout Equivalents on such
Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section 1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v),
Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(i) shall be paid
by the Buyer by delivery to the Common Shareholders of shares of Buyer Common
Stock issued in the name of each Common Shareholder having an Earnout Value
equal to the Earnout Consideration payable to each such Common Shareholder on
the applicable Earnout Distribution Date.

                   (ii)   For each share of Buyer Common Stock acquired upon
exercise of an Option during the period commencing on the Effective Time and
ending on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date (not including with respect
to the Second Earnout Distribution Date (A) any shares of Buyer Common Stock
delivered pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(ii) on the First Earnout Distribution
Date or (B) any shares of Buyer Common Stock issued as a result of an increase
pursuant to Section 1.10(f)(iii) on the First Earnout Distribution Date in the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option), the Earnout
Holder that initially acquired such share of Common Stock shall be eligible to
receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common
Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date as is obtained by dividing (x)
the aggregate Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the Common Earnout
Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date by (y) the Earnout Equivalents as of
such Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section 1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v),
Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(ii) shall be paid
by the Buyer by delivery to Common Earnout Holders of shares of Buyer Common
Stock issued in the name of each Common Earnout Holder having an Earnout Value
equal to the Earnout Consideration payable to each such Common Earnout Holder on
the applicable Earnout Distribution Date.

                   (iii)  For each share of Buyer Common Stock subject to an
Option that is outstanding as of an Earnout Distribution Date (not including
with respect to the Second Earnout Distribution Date any shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable as a result of an increase pursuant to this Section 1.10(f)(iii)
on the First Earnout Distribution Date in the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock subject to such Option), the Common Earnout Holder, upon exercise of such
Option, shall be eligible to receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration
to be delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date
as is obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Earnout Consideration to be
delivered to the Common Earnout Holders on such Earnout Distribution Date by (y)
the Earnout Equivalents as of such Earnout Distribution Date. Subject to Section
1.15 and Section 1.10(e)(v), Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this
Section 1.10(f)(iii) shall be paid by increasing the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock subject to such outstanding Option by a number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock equal to the portion of the Earnout Consideration payable to the
Common Earnout Holders on the applicable Earnout Distribution Date with respect
to all shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Option divided by the
Earnout Value as of the applicable Earnout Distribution Date.

                                       11
<Page>

                   (iv)   The Preferred Shareholders shall be eligible to
receive that portion of the Earnout Consideration to be delivered to the
Preferred Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.10(a), if any, on a pro rata basis
based on the number Preferred Shares held by each such Preferred Shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Earnout Consideration payable pursuant
to this Section 1.10(f)(iv) shall be paid by the Buyer by delivery to the
Preferred Shareholders of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the name of
each Preferred Shareholder having an Earnout Value equal to the Earnout
Consideration payable to each such Preferred Shareholder on the applicable
Earnout Distribution Date.

                   (v)    The right to receive a portion of the Earnout
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall be nontransferable, except by
operation of law. For avoidance of doubt, the right to receive the Earnout
Consideration hereunder shall remain with the Earnout Holders and shall not be
affected by the sale or transfer of any Buyer Common Stock by the Earnout
Holders following the Effective Time.

                   (vi)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the distribution of
Earnout Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.10(f) would cause the aggregate
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
(including for this purpose all shares of Buyer Common Stock issued or issuable
pursuant to Options outstanding at the time of such distribution) to exceed
6,200,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Buyer may substitute cash for those
shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issuable pursuant to
this Section 1.10(f), but only to the extent that such shares, when combined
with the other shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable under this Agreement,
exceed 6,200,000 shares; provided, however, any such substituted cash shall not
be paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall have no further obligation with respect to the
cash the Buyer would have substituted pursuant to this Section 1.5(f)(vi), to
the extent such substitution would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to fail to satisfy the Stock Consideration Requirement or in the
alternative, any such lower stock consideration requirement that Dorsey &
Whitney LLP opines to the Earnout Representatives will not adversely impact the
tax opinion issued by Dorsey & Whitney LLP under Section 5.3(h).

            (g)    No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be issued to Earnout Holders, and such Earnout Holders
shall not be entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or
distributions or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to
such Earnout Holders. In lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
that would have otherwise been issued, each Earnout Holder that would have been
entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive a
cash payment equal to the Earnout Value of the fractional share of Buyer Common
Stock that such Earnout Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

            (h)    In the event of a Change in Control of the Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Second Earnout Period, then immediately prior to such Change
in Control (but subject to the consummation of such Change in Control) the
Earnout Holders shall be entitled to receive, in accordance with Section
1.10(f), Earnout Consideration of $45,000,000 less any amounts previously paid
pursuant to this Section 1.10 regardless of the Gross Profits of the Business
Unit,

                                       12
<Page>

as if each Earnout Distribution Date occurred on the date of the consummation of
the Change in Control.

            (i)    The Company agrees and acknowledges that the Buyer may make
from time to time such business decisions as it deems appropriate in the conduct
of the Business Unit's business, including actions that may have an impact on
the Gross Profits of the Business Unit, and the Earnout Holders will have no
right to claim any lost Earnout Consideration or other damages as a result of
such decisions so long as the actions were taken in good faith by the Buyer and
were not taken by the Buyer for the purpose of avoiding or frustrating the
provisions of this Section 1.10.

            (j)    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Buyer may elect to retain up to the Set-Off Amount from the
amounts payable, if any, to Common Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.10 to
satisfy the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders (other
than the former holders of the Preferred Shares) as provided in Section 6.1
below.

            (k)    All issuances of Earnout Consideration to a particular
Earnout Holder shall be subject to the expiration or termination of all waiting
periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act applicable
to such Earnout Holder's acquisition of the Earnout Consideration.

            (l)    The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
by the shareholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the earnout
arrangements specified in this Section 1.10, including the right of the Buyer to
retain up to the Set-Off Amount to satisfy the indemnification obligations of
the Indemnifying Shareholders as provided herein and the appointment and
authority of the Earnout Representatives.

     1.11   ESCROW.

            (a)    On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent the General Escrow Merger Consideration and the Tax Escrow Merger
Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.5, for the purpose of securing
the applicable indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders set
forth in this Agreement. The General Escrow Merger Consideration and the Tax
Escrow Merger Consideration shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the General
Escrow Agreement and the Tax Escrow Agreement, respectively, pursuant to the
terms thereof. The Escrow Merger Consideration shall be held as a trust fund and
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreements.

            (b)    The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
by the shareholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the Escrow
Agreements and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the
placement of the Escrow Merger Consideration in escrow and the appointment and
authority of the Indemnification Representatives.

                                       13
<Page>

            (c)    Notwithstanding the initial allocation in accordance with
Section 1.5(e), the Indemnification Representatives shall be entitled to
instruct the Escrow Agent to reallocate the amounts held under the General
Escrow Agreement and the Tax Escrow Agreement in accordance with that certain
letter agreement dated August 12, 2004 between Timothy D. Ryan, Thomas A.
Turner, Summit Partners, L.P. and the other parties named therein, and the
Preferred Shareholders and Common Shareholders shall be bound by any
determination by the Indemnification Representatives in this regard; provided
that such agreement shall not in any manner reduce, delay or impair any
distributions to the Buyer from the General Escrow Agreement or the Tax Escrow
Agreement pursuant to Article VI hereof. The determination of the
Indemnification Representatives regarding any such reallocation shall be binding
and non-appealable with respect to the Common Shareholders and the Preferred
Shareholders.

     1.12   ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.

            (a)    The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be the same as the Articles of Incorporation of the Transitory
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) the name of
the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company
and (ii) the identity of the incorporator shall be deleted.

            (b)    The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of the Transitory
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

     1.13   NO FURTHER RIGHTS. From and after the Effective Time, no Company
Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as provided herein or by
law.

     1.14   CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for Initial Per Share Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, subject to
Section 1.11 and to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

     1.15   TAXES. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer LLC shall have the
right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder
(including any payments to be made under the Escrow Agreements) if such
withholding is required by law and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including
Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Company
Shareholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Company Shareholder

consistent with the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in all
material respects; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Financial Statements referred to

timely basis all Taxes that were due and payable in respect of all Tax Returns
required to be filed prior to the Closing without regard to extensions to file
the Tax Returns, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. The accruals and

            (s)    No event has occurred since the Most Recent Balance Sheet
Date by reason of which any balancing charge may fail to be made against or any
disposal value may fail to be brought into account by any of the UK Subsidiaries
under the Capital Allowances Act 2001.

            (t)    The book value shown in or adopted for the purpose of the
Most Recent Balance Sheet as the value of each of the assets of the UK
Subsidiaries on the disposal of which a chargeable gain or allowable loss could
arise does not exceed the amount which on a disposal of such asset at the date

None of the UK Subsidiaries has since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date
incurred any liability to or been accountable for any stamp duty reserve tax or
any stamp duty land tax (or any corresponding Taxes in any foreign jurisdiction)
and there has been no conditional agreement which could lead to any of the UK
Subsidiaries incurring such a liability or becoming so accountable. No UK stamp
duty or UK stamp duty reserve Tax will arise in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether levied on or payable
or paid by the Buyer, the Buyer LLC, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

            (v)    The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is duly registered
for the purposes of value added tax (or any corresponding Taxes in any foreign
jurisdiction), to the extent that it is required to be so registered. There has
been no transfer of a business as a going concern in respect of which any of the
UK Subsidiaries could become, or has at any time since

                                       22
<Page>

the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date been, liable under s.44 UK VATA 1994. No act

has been given under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to UK VATA 1994. None of the UK

tax year. None of the UK Subsidiaries has any interest in any land which is, or

the UK VATA 1994. In the case of each capital item (if any) within the meaning
of Part XV of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 ("Part XV"), in relation to
which a liability under Part XV has arisen or could in future arise on any of
the UK Subsidiaries, the Disclosure Schedule sets out full and accurate
particulars of past adjustments under Part XV and full and accurate particulars
of all matters to date which could be relevant in determining future adjustments
under Part XV.

            (w)    Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be
liable for any Taxes in relation to any options granted prior to Closing to any
directors or employees resident for Tax purposes in the United Kingdom as a
result of the assumption, cancellation, exercise, assignment or release of such

Subsidiary or Buyer LLC, (b) require on the part of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or Buyer LLC any filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or

            (a)    From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the
Company shall promptly deliver (upon receipt of such information) to the Buyer
supplemental information concerning events or circumstances occurring subsequent
to the date hereof which would render any representation, warranty or statement
in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule inaccurate or incomplete at any
time after the date of this Agreement until the Closing. Except as set forth
below, no such supplemental information shall be deemed to avoid or cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an amendment of any
representation, warranty or statement in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedule; provided that if such supplemental information relates to an event or
circumstance occurring subsequent to the date hereof and outside of the
Company's reasonable control, if the Buyer would have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) as a result of the information so
disclosed and it does not exercise such right prior to the Closing, then such
supplemental information shall

                                       41
<Page>

constitute an amendment of the representation or warranty to which it relates
for that purpose. Unless the Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) hereof by reason of such supplemental information
(when taken together with any other such supplemental information provided from
the date hereof through and including such date), and exercises that right
within the period of three business days after notice is given pursuant to the
paragraph above, the supplemental information delivered pursuant hereto will be
deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedule and to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained in Article II above for the purposes of
satisfying the conditions to Closing in Article V.

            (b)    From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Buyer
shall promptly deliver to the Company supplemental information concerning events
or circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof which would render any
representation or warranty in this Agreement inaccurate or incomplete at any
time after the date of this Agreement until the Closing. Except as set forth
below, no such supplemental information shall be deemed to avoid or cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an amendment of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement; provided that if such supplemental
information relates to an event or circumstance occurring subsequent to the date
hereof and outside of the Buyer's reasonable control, if the Company would have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) as a result of
the information so disclosed and it does not exercise such right prior to the
Closing, then such supplemental information shall constitute an amendment of the
representation or warranty to which it relates for that purpose. Unless the
Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
hereof by reason of such supplemental information (when taken together with any
other such supplemental information provided from the date hereof through and
including such date), and exercises that right within the period of three
business days after notice is given pursuant to the paragraph above, the
supplemental information delivered pursuant hereto will be deemed to have
amended the Disclosure Schedule and to have qualified the representations and
warranties contained in Article III above for the purposes of satisfying the
conditions to Closing in Article V.

     4.7    EXCLUSIVITY.

            (a)    The Company shall not, and the Company shall require each of
its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any
inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other than the Buyer)
concerning any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business
combination, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange, sale of stock, sale of
material assets or similar business transaction involving the Company, any
Subsidiary or any division of the Company, (ii) furnish any non-public
information concerning the business, properties or assets of the Company, any
Subsidiary or any division of the Company to any party in connection with any
such transaction (other than the Buyer) or (iii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any party (other than the Buyer) concerning any such
transaction.

            (b)    The Company shall immediately notify any party with which
discussions or negotiations of the nature described in paragraph (a) above were
pending that the Company is terminating such discussions or negotiations. If the
Company receives any inquiry, proposal or offer of the nature described in
paragraph (a) above, the Company shall, within one business day

                                       42
<Page>

after such receipt, notify the Buyer of such inquiry, proposal or offer,
including the identity of the other party and, to the extent known, the terms of
such inquiry, proposal or offer.

     4.8    EXPENSES. Except as set forth in Article VI and the Escrow
Agreements, each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and other advisory fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     4.9    INDEMNIFICATION. The Buyer, Transitory Subsidiary and Buyer LLC
shall, for a period of six years after the Closing, assume and honor the
exculpatory and indemnification provisions now existing in the Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Company for the benefit of any individual who
served as a director or officer of the Company at any time prior to the Closing
or in indemnification agreements between the Company and certain of its
directors identified in Schedule 2.15 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     4.10   LISTING OF SHARES. The Buyer shall, if required by the rules of The
Nasdaq Stock Market, file with The Nasdaq Stock Market a Notification Form for
Listing Additional Shares with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger.

     4.11   FINAL MERGER. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, but at least one business day after the business day of the Effective
Time and in no event later than the close of business on the fifteenth business
day immediately following the business day of the Effective Time (unless
additional time is reasonably required to effect an orderly transition of the
payroll and benefit plans of the Company to the Buyer, in which event no later
than the close of business on the thirtieth calendar day immediately following
the calendar day of the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall merge
with and into the Buyer LLC. From and after the effectiveness of the Final
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall
cease and the Buyer LLC shall continue as the surviving entity in the Final
Merger. The Buyer and the Buyer LLC shall take all such steps and actions as
shall be required to cause the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer LLC to
consummate the Final Merger as set forth in this Section 4.11.

     4.12   EMPLOYEE MATTERS. All Company employees retained by the Buyer after
the Closing Date (the "RETAINED EMPLOYEES") shall be entitled to receive
compensation and benefits that initially are comparable, in the aggregate, to
the compensation and benefits offered to other similarly situated employees of
the Buyer, provided that the Buyer retains the right to adjust such compensation
and benefits following the Closing in its business judgment and the right to
terminate any Retained Employee. The Buyer shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their Reasonable Best Efforts to permit the Retained
Employees to receive credit under their employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements for service performed for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
(or a predecessor to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or
assets to the extent credited by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) so that
such service shall be treated as service with the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit levels where length of services is relevant to
benefit levels (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, benefit accrual under
any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and any accrual that would result
in any duplication of

                                       43
<Page>

benefits), subject to the application of any break-in-service rules under such
plans, programs, arrangements and applicable law. The Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any payments made by a Retained
Employee under a Company Plan that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits during the plan year of such Company Plan in which the
Effective Time occurs to be taken into account under a corresponding plan
maintained by the Buyer for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee for the
applicable plan year as if such payments had been paid in accordance with such
corresponding Buyer plan.

     4.13   SECTION 280G COVENANT. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any and all payments from the
Company contingent on the Merger (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(i) of
the Code) that could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b) of the
Code, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements for the
small business exemption of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Such vote shall determine the "disqualified
individual's" right to all such payments or other compensation from the Company.
In addition, before the vote is submitted to stockholders, the Company shall
provide adequate disclosure to Company Shareholders of all material facts
concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute
payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder.

     4.14   TAX MATTERS. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).
Each Party agrees that it shall (a) treat the Merger and the Final Merger as a
single integrated transaction (in which the Company merged directly with and
into the Buyer LLC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (b) report the Merger
and the Final Merger as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code on its
United States Tax Returns, (c) retain such records and file such information as
is required to be retained and filed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3 in connection with the Merger and the Final Merger, and (d) otherwise
use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the Merger and the Final Merger,
considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal
income tax purposes, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. No Party shall take any action, fail to take
any action, cause any action to be taken or cause any action to fail to be taken
that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger and the Final Merger,
considered together as a single integrated transaction, from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

     4.15   FIRPTA CERTIFICATION. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer either (i) a notice from the Company, also delivered to the
Internal Revenue Service, that the Company Shares are not a "U.S. real property
interest" in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 897 and 1445
of the Code, or (ii) certifications from all of the Company Shareholders that
they are not "foreign persons" in accordance with Treasury Regulations under
Section 1445 of the Code. If the Buyer does not receive either the notice or
certifications described above on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be
permitted to

                                       44
<Page>

withhold from the Per Share Upfront Common Consideration and the Per Share
Preferred Consideration, as applicable, any required withholding tax under
Section 1445 of the Code.

     4.16   TERMINATION OF 401(k) PLAN. At least two days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall adopt a resolution or obtain a written consent
terminating its 401(k) plan effective as of the day preceding the Closing Date.
The Buyer hereby agrees that the Buyer will cause the Buyer's 401(k) plan to
accept rollovers or direct rollovers of "eligible rollover distributions" within
the meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code made with respect to the Company's
employees pursuant to the Company's 401(k) plan by reason of such termination.
Rollover amounts contributed to the Buyer's 401(k) plan in accordance with this
Section 4.16 shall at all times be 100% vested and shall be invested in
accordance with the provisions of the Buyer's 401(k) plan. In the case of any
employee of the Company, the Buyer's 401(k) plan will take into account, for
eligibility and vesting purposes, such employee's service prior to the Closing
Date that is creditable to such employee under the Company's 401(k) plan. The
Buyer acknowledges and agree that the provisions of Section 6.1 shall not extend
to any breach or alleged breach by the Company or the Subsidiaries of a
representation or warranty or covenant to the extent that such breach arises out
of the actions to be taken by the Company with respect to its 401(k) plan as
required by this Section 4.16; and the Buyer and the Buyer LLC further agree to
indemnify the Indemnifying Shareholders and the directors of the Company in
respect of, and hold them harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by the Indemnifying Shareholders or directors of the Company resulting
from or relating to the actions to be taken by the Company with respect to its
401(k) plan as required by this Section 4.16.

     4.17   TAX DELIVERABLES. The Company, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary
and the Buyer LLC shall use their respective best efforts to provide Dorsey &
Whitney LLP and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP such representation
letters, certificates and other documents that either such firm shall reasonably
request in connection with delivering the opinions contemplated by Sections
5.2(p) and 5.3(h).

     4.18   TAX RETURNS. The Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed all Tax Returns for all Taxable periods that include (but do
not end on) the Closing Date and all Taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of the Closing Date.
All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with
prior practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries, except as required by
applicable Tax law. The Indemnification Representatives shall have the right to
review and comment on any such Tax Return prepared by the Buyer (a draft of
which shall be provided to the Indemnification Representatives not less than
five business days prior to filing such Tax Return) to the extent the
Indemnifying Shareholders would incur an indemnification liability thereunder.

            (a)    any breach, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date, of any representation or warranty of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary or the Buyer LLC contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
or instrument furnished by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Buyer LLC
to the Company pursuant to this Agreement; or

            (b)    any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Buyer LLC contained in this Agreement or
any agreement or

                                       50

instrument furnished by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or the Buyer LLC to
the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

     6.3    INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS.

            (a)    An Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such
notification shall be given within 20 days after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of notice of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable
detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the
basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of the claimed damages;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party
in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or
liability caused by or arising out of such failure. Within 20 days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice
thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third
Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
PROVIDED that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense
if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages,
fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which
the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VI and (B)
the AD DAMNUM is less than or equal to the amount of Damages for which the
Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article VI and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party may not assume control of the defense of Third Party Action involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under
the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action,
the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may
participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep
the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and
the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect
to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such
Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party
with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of
this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third
Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.3(a) or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Action; PROVIDED that,
with respect to each of (i) and (ii) in the foregoing sentence, the Indemnified
Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Party
Action. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                                       51

            (b)    In order to seek indemnification under this Article VI, an
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to
an Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver a copy of the Claim
Notice to the Escrow Agent.

            (c)    Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which
the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall be
accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of
the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer; provided that if the
Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to
an Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the
Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent
to distribute to the Buyer such portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration as
has an aggregate cash and Buyer Common Stock Value equal to the Claimed Amount),
(ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount
(in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by
wire transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer and is
seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to an Escrow Agreements, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three
days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both
parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer such portion of
the Escrow Merger Consideration as has an aggregate cash and Buyer Common Stock
Value equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. All distributions of the Escrow
Merger Consideration to the Buyer under this Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.3(d)
shall consist of pro rata portions of each Sub Escrow Account in the applicable
Escrow Agreement on deposit with the Escrow Agent based on the ratio that the
number of Escrow Shares initially deposited in such Sub Escrow Account bore to
the number of Escrow Shares initially deposited in all Sub Escrow Accounts under
the applicable Escrow Agreement.

            (d)    During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response
that reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall submit the Dispute to binding arbitration. If the Indemnified Party is the
Buyer and is seeking to enforce the claim that is the subject of the Dispute
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of
the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or
otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow
Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration shall be
distributed to the Buyer and/or the Indemnifying Shareholders (which notice
shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

            (e)    If, as set forth in Section 6.3(d), a Dispute is submitted to
binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator
(the "ARBITRATOR") in accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time
to time and the following provisions:

                                       52
<Page>

                   (i)    In the event of any conflict between the Commercial
Rules in effect from time to time and the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

                   (ii)   The parties shall commence the arbitration by jointly
filing a written submission with the New York, New York office of the AAA in
accordance with Commercial Rule 5 (or any successor provision).

                   (iii)  Depositions and other discovery shall be conducted to
the extent permitted by the arbitrator in the arbitration.

                   (iv)   Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the
arbitration hearing, the Arbitrator shall prepare and distribute to the parties
a writing setting forth the arbitral award and the Arbitrator's reasons
therefor. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to Section 10.11), provided that
the Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to grant injunctive relief,
specific performance or other equitable relief.

                   (v)    The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under
the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of
this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 6.3(e), or (y) address
or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties.

                   (vi)   In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant
to this Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, except that
the fees and costs of the AAA and the Arbitrator, the costs and expenses of
obtaining the facility where the arbitration hearing is held, and such other
costs and expenses as the Arbitrator may determine to be directly related to the
conduct of the arbitration and appropriately borne jointly by the parties (which
shall not include any party's attorneys' fees or costs, witness fees (if any),
costs of investigation and similar expenses) shall be shared equally by the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.

            (f)    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.3, if
a third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified
Party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Damages for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, and such Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such
obligation, then (i) such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such
obligation with the consent from the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (but with it being understood
that the giving of such consent shall not prejudice the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to
indemnification with respect to such matter or in any manner operate as a
presumption that the Indemnifying Party concurred that the amount at issue or
paid was reasonable or appropriate), (ii) such Indemnified Party may
subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions
of this Article VI, and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in

                                       53
<Page>

accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, for any such Damages for
which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (subject to
the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's
entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to
indemnification, under the terms of this Article VI).

            (g)    For purposes of this Section 6.3 and the second and third
sentences of Section 6.4, (i) if the Indemnifying Shareholders comprise the
Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall be deemed to refer to the
Indemnification Representatives, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Shareholders
comprise the Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (except
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments)
shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnification Representatives. The
Indemnification Representatives may only take action by unanimous consent and
shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Indemnifying Shareholder
to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all instruments on
behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the Indemnifying
Shareholders under this Article VI. The Indemnification Representatives shall
have no liability to any Indemnifying Shareholder for any action taken or
omitted on behalf of the Indemnifying Shareholders pursuant to this Article VI.

            (h)    With respect to each Tax Matter for which there is a Final
Determination, within three days following such Final Determination, the Buyer
and the Indemnification Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice executed by both parties (A) if a notice is not otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or Section 6.3(d), instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the Buyer such portion of the Tax Escrow Merger
Consideration as has an aggregate value equal to the Damages, if any, relating
to such Tax Matter and (B) instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Indemnifying Shareholders, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Tax Escrow
Merger Consideration remaining in escrow after the distribution to the Buyer of
the Damages related to such Tax Matter exceeds (ii) $500,000 plus the aggregate
Tax Escrow Merger Consideration reserved, as set forth on Schedule 6.1(f), with
respect to the Tax Matters for which there has not been a Final Determination as
of such date. For the purpose of this Section 6.3(h), "Final Determination"
shall mean the first to occur of:

            1.     any written notice from or agreement with the appropriate
                   Governmental Entity resolving the particular Tax Matter;

            2.     a decision, judgment, decree, or other order by a court of
                   competent jurisdiction that is not subject to further
                   judicial review (by appeal or otherwise) and has become
                   final;

            3.     the execution of a closing agreement under Section 7121 of
                   the Code or the acceptance by the IRS or its counsel of an
                   offer in compromise under Section 7122 of the Code, or
                   comparable agreements under the laws of other jurisdictions;

            4.     any other final disposition of the Tax liability for such
                   period by reason of the expiration of the applicable statute
                   of limitations; or

                                       54
<Page>

            5.     any other event that the Buyer and the Indemnification
                   Representative agree in writing is a final and irrevocable
                   determination of the liability at issue.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no Final Determination has been made
with respect to the Tax Matter set forth in Schedule 6.1(f)(2), on April 30,
2006, the amount reserved for such Tax Matter shall be reduced to $175,000 and
the Indemnification Representatives shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to
the Indemnifying Shareholders, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Tax Escrow
Merger Consideration remaining in escrow (as such reserves may have been
adjusted) exceeds (ii) $500,000 plus the aggregate Tax Escrow Merger
Consideration reserved, as set forth on Schedule 6.1(f) (as such reserves may
have been adjusted), with respect to the Tax Matters for which there has not
been a Final Determination as of such date.

     6.4    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties that are covered by the indemnification obligations in Section 6.1(a)
and Section 6.2(a) shall (a) survive the Closing and (b) shall expire on
September 30, 2005 (it being understood that the Buyer may recover from the
Set-Off Amount on or before March 31, 2006, but only in the event a Claim Notice
is given on or before September 30, 2005), except that (i) the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3.2 and 3.3 shall survive the
Closing without limitation, and (ii) the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 2.9 shall survive until 90 days following expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitation (as such periods may be extended by regulatory
or other enforcement action). If, and only if, an Indemnified Party delivers to
an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation or warranty, either
a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty, or an
Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty,
then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for
purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the legal
proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has
been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party;
and if the Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim Notice
to the Escrow Agent and Escrow Merger Consideration has been retained in escrow
after the applicable Termination Date (as defined in the applicable Escrow
Agreement) with respect to such Expected Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such
retained Escrow Merger Consideration to the Indemnifying Shareholders in
accordance with the terms of such Escrow Agreement. The rights to
indemnification set forth in this Article VI shall not be affected by (i) any
investigation conducted by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) by an Indemnified Party, whether before
or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date (including through
supplements to the Disclosure Schedule permitted by Section 4.6), with respect
to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation which is the subject of indemnification hereunder or (ii) any
waiver by an Indemnified Party of any closing condition relating to the accuracy
of representations and warranties or the performance of or compliance with
agreements and covenants.

Escrow Agreements and (B) the individual liability of each Indemnifying
Shareholder for Damages under Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(h), and 6.1(i) shall not

Account (as such amounts may have been adjusted from time to time as a result of
sales of shares of Buyer Common Stock held in the such Indemnifying
Shareholder's Sub Escrow Account) and such Indemnifying Shareholder's pro rata
portion of the Set-Off Amount, less any amounts previously distributed to such
Indemnifying Shareholder pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreements,

                   (iii)  the Indemnifying Shareholders shall not be liable

to a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.9 shall
not be counted towards determining whether the $1,000,000 threshold set forth in
Section 6.5(a)(iii) has been exceeded,

                   (v)    subject to the further limitations set forth in
Section 6.5(a)(vi) below applicable to the Preferred Shareholders, each
Indemnifying Shareholder shall only be liable for his, her or its pro rata share
of Damages (based on the amount of the Initial Per Share Consideration received
by such Indemnifying Shareholder as a percentage of the aggregate Initial Per
Share Consideration); provided that to the extent that the Buyer is no longer
entitled to

                                       56
<Page>

collect Damages from an Indemnifying Shareholder pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(vi)

rata share of the remaining Damages based on the amount of the Initial Per Share
Consideration received by such remaining Indemnifying Shareholder as a
percentage of the aggregate Initial Per Share Consideration received by all of
the remaining Indemnifying Shareholders; but in no event shall an Indemnifying
Shareholder be liable for Damages under any provision of this Agreement in
excess of the Total Merger Consideration received by such Indemnifying
Shareholder, and

                   (vi)   with respect to the Preferred Shareholders, such
Indemnifying Shareholder's aggregate liability for Damages pursuant to this
Article VI, except for Damages pursuant to Section 6.1(c) relating to such
Indemnifying Shareholder's Preferred Shares, shall not exceed any amounts
remaining in such Preferred Shareholder's Sub Escrow Account under the General
Escrow Agreement and shall be payable solely from such Preferred Shareholder's
Sub Escrow Account and solely with respect to a Claim Notice or an Expected
Claim Notice delivered prior to September 30, 2005;

provided that the limitations set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 6.5(a) shall not apply to a claim pursuant to Section 6.1(a) relating to
a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3 or
2.9.

            (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no
individual claim (or series of related claims) for indemnification under Section
6.2(a) shall be valid and assertable unless it is (or they are) for an amount in
excess of $20,000, (ii) the aggregate liability of the Buyer for Damages under

            (c)    The General Escrow Agreement and the Set-Off Amount are
intended to secure the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Shareholders under this Agreement. In addition to the General Escrow Agreement
and Set-Off Amount, the Tax Escrow Agreement is intended to secure the
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders pursuant to Section
6.1(a) (but only with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 2.9) and Section 6.1(f). However, the rights of the Buyer
under Section 6.1(a) relating to a breach of the representations set forth in
Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.9, and under Sections 6.1(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f)
shall not be limited to the Escrow Merger Consideration and the Set-Off Amount
nor shall the Escrow Agreements and the Set-Off Amount be the exclusive means
for the Buyer to enforce such rights and instead the aggregate liability of the
Indemnifying Shareholders for Damages with respect to such matters shall not
exceed an amount equal to 100% of the Total Merger Consideration received by
such Indemnifying Shareholder; provided that (i) the Buyer shall not attempt to
collect any Damages directly from the Indemnifying Shareholders except to the
extent that the General Escrow Merger Consideration held in escrow pursuant to
the General Escrow Agreement is less than such Damages and (ii) the Buyer shall
not

                                       57
<Page>

attempt to collect any Damages pursuant to Section 6.1(f) from the Escrow Merger
Consideration held in escrow pursuant to the General Escrow Agreement or the
Set-Off Amount except to the extent that the Tax Escrow Merger Consideration
held in escrow pursuant to the Tax Escrow Agreement is less than such Damages.
The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders pursuant to
Section 6.1(f) shall expire on the third anniversary of the Closing Date. If,
and only if, an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, on or
before the third anniversary of the Closing Date, a Claim Notice or an Expected
Claim Notice for one or more claims pursuant to Section 6.1(f), then the
indemnification obligations pursuant to 6.1(f) shall survive until, but only for
purposes of, the resolution of the matter or matters covered by such Claim
Notice or Expected Claim Notice.

            (d)    The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Shareholders pursuant to Sections 6.1(b) and 6.1(e) shall survive until
September 30, 2005; provided, that if, and only if, an Indemnified Party
delivers to an Indemnifying Party, on or before September 30, 2005, a Claim
Notice or an Expected Claim Notice for one or more claims pursuant to Section
6.1(b) or Section 6.1(e), then the indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(e) shall survive until, but only for purposes of,
the resolution of the matter or matters covered by such Claim Notice or Expected
Claim Notice.

            (e)    The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Shareholders pursuant to Section 6.1(d) shall survive until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that if, and only if, an Indemnified
Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, on or before the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, a Claim Notice or an Expected Claim Notice for one or more
claims pursuant to Section 6.1(d), then the indemnification obligations pursuant
to Section 6.1(d) shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution
of the matter or matters covered by such Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice.

            (f)    Except with respect to claims based on fraud, after the
Closing, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article VI and the
Escrow Agreements shall be the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to claims resulting from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

            (g)    No Indemnifying Shareholder shall have any right of
contribution against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements.

     6.6    TAX AUDITS, CLAIMS, ETC.. In the event any taxing authority informs
the Indemnification Representatives, on the one hand, or Buyer or the Company
(or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, of any notice of any proposed
audit, examination, adjustment, claim, assessment, proposed adjustment, or
