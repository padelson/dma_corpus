3.5(a) and shall use the definitions  set forth in Article 1.1. Should the
Auditor be prevented for any reason  whatsoever from fulfilling its mission
under this Article 2.2.1 (c), the  amount of the Closing Intercompany
Indebtedness and of the Closing  Indebtedness shall be determined pursuant to
the provisions of Article  1843-4 of the French Civil Code. Solely for the

item by item  basis, of the amounts owed to each creditor, specifying, to the
extent  reasonably available, the relevant Company or Subsidiary owing such 
INDEBTEDNESS. The failure of the Auditor to include any such details shall 
not affect the binding nature of its decision. The fees and expenses of the 
Auditor shall be shared equally between Guilbert on the one hand and the 
Purchaser on the other hand. The Parties agree to make all information 
reasonably requested by the Auditor available to the Auditor as promptly as 
practicable.  (d) (i) To the extent that the sum of the Notified Closing
Intercompany  Indebtedness plus the Notified Closing Indebtedness results in
a greater  amount than the sum of the Audited Closing Intercompany
Indebtedness plus  the Audited Closing Indebtedness, then the Purchaser shall
pay the amount  of such difference to the Sellers. (ii) To the extent that
the sum of the  Notified Closing Intercompany Indebtedness plus the Notified
Closing  Indebtedness results in a smaller amount than the sum of the
Audited  Closing Intercompany Indebtedness plus the Audited Closing
Indebtedness,  then the Sellers shall pay the amount of such difference to
the Purchaser.  (e) (i) To the extent that the Notified Closing Intercompany
Indebtedness is  greater than the Audited Closing Intercompany Indebtedness,

Indebtedness is  lower than the Audited Closing Intercompany Indebtedness,
then the  Purchaser, acting on behalf of the Companies and the Subsidiaries

understood that the Purchaser commits himself to take over any guarantees 
whatsoever granted by any member of the PPR Group with respect to the

Agreement, the Purchaser will use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations to
obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances of
all Governmental Authorities, including all Antitrust Clearances necessary or
advisable to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, the "Required Approvals") as soon as practicable after
the date hereof and in any case prior to the Closing, including (i) preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all Required Approvals and (ii) taking
all    -26-      reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all
such Required Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to make, as promptly as practicable, (A)
appropriate filings with the Antitrust Authorities in accordance with
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust, investment or similar
laws, and (B) all other necessary filings with other Governmental Authorities
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and, to supply as promptly
as practicable any additional information or documentation that may be
requested by such Governmental Authorities and to use best efforts to cause
the receipt of Required Approvals as soon as practicable. The Purchaser shall
offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps to
avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation law that may be asserted by any Antitrust Authority or other
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any
court or other forum by any party, including appeals. In addition to and
without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall propose, negotiate, offer
to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect),
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries or, from and after the Closing, the Companies or
their Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or
commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the
Purchaser, the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid
the filing of any suit or proceeding or the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.  5.2.2 The Purchaser shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or
negotiations with any Governmental Authority or Antitrust Authority relating
to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall keep PPR fully informed as to
the status of such proceedings or negotiations and allow PPR\'s outside
counsels to attend such proceedings or negotiations. Each of the Purchaser
and the Sellers shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Article
5.3.1 above to obtain all Required Approvals, use its best efforts, to the
extent practicable, and subject to the Purchaser\'s right not to disclose to
the Sellers any data, information or documents which the Purchaser deems to
be confidential and/or proprietary, to the extent such data, information or
document are disclosed to the Sellers\' legal advisors on a confidential
basis, to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) subject
to applicable law, permit the Sellers to review in advance any proposed
written communication between the Purchaser and any Antitrust Authority or
other Governmental Authority, (iii) promptly inform the Sellers of and
provide, on a confidential basis, PPR\'s outside counsels a copy of (and, at
the Sellers\' reasonable request, supply to the Sellers) any communication
(or other correspondence or memoranda) received by the Purchaser from, or
given by the Purchaser to, any Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the Sellers in advance
to the extent practicable of any meeting or conference with any Antitrust
Authority or other Governmental Authority or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the
extent permitted by the applicable    -27-      Antitrust Authority
or other Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Sellers the
opportunity to attend such meetings and conferences.  5.2.3 In furtherance
and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Articles
5.2.1 and 5.2.2 above, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any regulatory law, or if any statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by an Antitrust Authority or
other Governmental Authority which would make the transactions contemplated
hereby illegal or would otherwise prevent, delay or otherwise adversely
affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
use its respective best efforts, including, subject to Article 5.2.1 above,
the Purchaser\'s selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or
conducting their business in a specified manner, or agreeing to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified
manner or permitting the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any
assets of the Purchaser, or, after the Closing, the Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries or the conducting of their business in a specified
manner, to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that would make illegal, rescind or otherwise materially restrict the
transactions contemplated hereby and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable so as to not so affect the transactions
contemplated hereby.  5.2.4 The Purchaser states that it is in the
Purchaser\'s intention, and hereby agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
ensure that the draft CO Form to be prepared in connection with the
Transaction is filed with the EU Antitrust Authorities no later than
September 16, 2002.  5.3 ACCESS  Subject to the requirements of applicable
laws and regulations, the Companies shall permit the Purchaser\'s
representatives to have appropriate access at reasonable times to the
records, books, registers, premises, accounting documents and other sources
of information relating to the Companies and the Subsidiaries in order to
prepare for Closing. Information obtained by the Purchaser under this Article
5.3 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement entered into between
the Purchaser and the counsels to the Sellers dated May 13, 2002 which
remains in full force and effect.  5.4 ASSISTANCE  5.4.1 The Sellers and
the Purchaser each agree to use their best efforts on commercially reasonable
basis to facilitate the Closing of the Transaction and the other transactions
provided for hereunder.    -28-      5.4.2 To the extent that it does
not affect the ability of the Sellers to conduct their business, the Sellers
further agree to provide the Purchaser with any assistance reasonably
requested of them by the Purchaser after the sale of the Shares to the
Purchaser, in particular in order to enable the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to comply with any reporting obligations relating to tax
or other matters. The Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers for their
reasonable out of pocket costs for providing such assistance.  5.4.3 PPR
shall use its reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in transitioning the
Companies and the Subsidiaries away from services provided by PPR to the
Companies and the Subsidiaries.   ARTICLE 6 - FURTHER ACTIONS  The
Parties agree to use their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under all applicable laws to obtain the consents referred to
in Article 7.1 hereunder and therefore make effective the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.  At all times prior to the Closing Date,
each party shall promptly notify the other in writing of the occurrence of
any event which will or may result in the failure of any of the conditions
contained in Article 7.1 to be satisfied.   ARTICLE 7 - CONDITIONS
PRECEDENT TO CLOSING   7.1 The Closing of the sale of the Shares is subject
to the condition that the Antitrust Clearance from all of the Antitrust
Authorities shall have been obtained.  7.2 In addition to the condition
provided for under Article 7.1, the Purchaser\'s obligation to buy the Shares
shall be subject to satisfaction, by the Closing Date at the latest, of the
following conditions, it being provided that such conditions are for the
Purchaser\'s benefit and shall include a discretionary right of the Purchaser
to waive them:  (a) The Sellers shall have complied in all material respects
with all their  obligations under Articles 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4;
and  (b) since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any
event  relating directly to the Mail Order Business operated by the Companies
and  their Subsidiaries having a Mail Order Material Adverse Effect.   
-29-      ARTICLE 8 - INDEMNIFICATION  8.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE
PURCHASER  8.1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article 8, the
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser (or the relevant
Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be) harmless from and against any and
all damages, liabilities and losses, including those resulting from a Tax
audit or reassessment (individually a "Loss" or collectively "LOSSES"),
asserted against, resulting in, imposed upon or incurred by the Purchaser,
the Companies or the Subsidiaries relating to, arising out of or resulting
from:   (a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of
the  Sellers contained in this Agreement;   (b) any breach or violation of
any covenant or agreement of the Sellers  contained in this Agreement (other
than Article 2); or  Except with respect to claims based upon fraud, the
right to indemnification provided for in this Article 8.1.1 shall be the
Purchaser\'s exclusive remedy for any such inaccuracy or breach of
representations or warranty or breach of covenant or agreement.  8.1.2 No
indemnification pursuant to Article 8.1.1 above will be made:   (a) if, and
to the extent that, provision to the relevant Loss was made  in the relevant
Financial Statements;   (b) to the extent that the relevant Losses are due
to Purchaser\'s or,  with respect to any period following the Closing, any
Company\'s or  Subsidiary\'s willful misconduct;   (c) if and to the extent
that (in the event that the relevant breach can  be cured) the Sellers have,
within thirty (30) days following  receipt by the Sellers of Purchaser\'s
notice, cured such breach by  specific performance;   (d) if and to the
extent that Purchaser or the Companies are entitled to  receive or have
received recovery for the relevant Losses from any  other Person (including
under any insurance policy) or if and to the  extent that non-recovery from
any other Person is due to the failure  of Purchaser and/or any Company
and/or any Subsidiary to use its or  their reasonable efforts to obtain such
recovery;   (e) if and to the extent that the relevant Losses arise or are
increased  as a result of the enactment or amendment of any legal
requirement  including with regard to Taxes after the date of this
Agreement;   (f) if the relevant Losses arise as a result of the application
of any  generally accepted accounting principles, procedures, methods and 
judgments other than those used to prepare the Financial Statements  as set
forth in SCHEDULE 3.5;    -30-       (g) if it relates to a Loss
resulting from a breach of a representation  or warranty in Article 3 that
was incorrect at the time this  Agreement was executed, but was subsequently
true and correct at  Closing, so long as (i) the Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall  not have breached their obligations under Section 5.1 of
this  Agreement in connection with causing such representation to be true 
and correct; and (ii) the actions taken by the Sellers, the  Companies or the
Subsidiaries to make such representation or  warranty true or correct at
Closing shall be at no cost for the  Companies, the Subsidiaries or the
Purchaser. The Sellers shall  endeavor to keep the Purchaser reasonably
informed of any actions  considered to be taken to make such representation
or warranty true  or correct at Closing provided that the failure to keep
the  Purchaser so informed shall not affect the carve out under this 
Article 8.1.2.(g). For the avoidance of doubt, this Article 8.1.2(g)  shall
not entitle the Sellers or PPR to amend the contents of any of  the Schedules
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing  Date; and   (h) if it
relates to a Loss resulting from an inaccuracy of Article  3.20, to the
extent that no third party has made a claim in relation  to the Third Party
Indebtedness that is paid by the Companies or the  Subsidiaries or is validly
determined to be fully legal and  enforceable against the Companies and the
Subsidiaries.  8.1.3 Effective nature of the Loss   (a) A Loss shall be
eligible for indemnification by the Sellers to the extent and only to the
extent such Loss has effectively been sustained by the Purchaser, one of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries.   (b) Any deficiency assessed by the Tax
authorities whose sole effect is to shift a Tax liability from one fiscal
year to another shall give rise to indemnification by the Sellers only
insofar as a Company or a Subsidiary is required to pay a penalty or interest
charge in relation thereto.   (c) Any deficiency assessed with regard to a
Tax, such as a value-added Tax, which is recoverable shall give rise to
indemnification by the Sellers only insofar as a Company and a Subsidiary is
required to pay a penalty or interest charge in relation thereto.   (d) Any
indemnification due by the Sellers shall be calculated taking into account
(i) the effect of any Tax savings realized by the Companies and
the Subsidiaries as a result of the Tax deductibility of the relevant Loss;
and (ii) the effect of the taxation of any such indemnification so that the
relevant Company or Subsidiary or the Purchaser shall be in the same position
as it would have been should the Loss have not occurred.   (e) Any
indemnification due by the Sellers shall be based on the amount of the Loss
actually suffered by the Companies and the Subsidiaries or the Purchaser, and
shall be computed without regard to any multiple, price-earnings or
equivalent ratio implicit in negotiating and/or settling the Purchase
Price.    -31-       (f) Any indemnification due by the Sellers shall
in all cases be limited to the amount of the Loss subject to the provisions
of paragraph (d) here above, notwithstanding the fact that the event giving
rise to the Sellers\' obligation may originate from an inaccuracy of several
of the representations and warranties made under Article 3 hereof.   (g) If
a claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only,
no indemnification shall be due unless and until such liability becomes due
and payable.   (h) In the event that any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries is required to make a payment in connection with a third-party
claim, the Sellers shall not be required to make any indemnification payment
in connection thereto before such payment has actually been made by the
relevant Company or the Subsidiary to such third party.   (i) With respect
to any claim relating to the Financial Statements, the Sellers shall not be
held liable for any indemnification of any Loss which results from the
application of any generally accepted accounting principles, procedures,
methods and judgements other than those used to prepare the Financial
Statements as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.5  8.1.4 Any payment made by the
Sellers under this Agreement shall be deemed to be an indemnification to the
relevant Company or the relevant Subsidiary, except if such Loss is suffered
by the Purchaser in which case the Purchaser shall be free to direct any
payments under this Article 8 to himself. However, the Purchaser shall be
free to direct payments either to itself or to any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries as it deems appropriate, to the extent that it does not
create any additional cost on the Sellers. The representations and warranties
made by the Sellers in this Agreement are for the benefit of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries.  8.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE SELLERS  Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless against any Loss arising out of
or resulting from:   (a) any inaccuracy, breach of any representation or
warranty by  Purchaser contained herein or in any document delivered 
hereunder; and   (b) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement
by  Purchaser contained herein to be performed on or prior to the  Closing
Date.  The indemnification of the Sellers pursuant to this Article 8.2 shall
be subject to limitations and qualifications which are reciprocal to those
applicable to the indemnification of the Purchaser provided for in Articles
8.1.2 and 8.1.3.    -32-      8.3 CONDITIONS OF
INDEMNIFICATION  The obligations of the Sellers and the Purchaser, as the
case may be, under Articles 8.1 and 8.2 (herein referred to as the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), with respect to claims shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:   (a) The person to whom such claim relates
(the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY")  will give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of
such claim in  any event within thirty (30) days (i) from receipt by the 
Indemnified Party of written notice of the commencement of any  action or
proceeding (except for actions, claims or proceedings  which require an
action, claim to be taken within thirty (30)  days or less for which such
delay shall be reduced to ten (10)  Business Days) or (ii) the knowledge by
the relevant Company of  the facts or events giving rise to the claim. The
Indemnified  Party shall have the right to control the defense, compromise
or  settlement of the proceeding, provided that (i) the Indemnified  Party
shall consult with the Indemnifying Party in a timely  manner on all
important strategic matters relating to any such  proceeding and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any  proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying  Party (it being understood that, with respect to
any settlement  without such prior written consent, the Indemnified Party
shall  not be entitled to indemnification therefor).   (b) Upon the final
determination of the liability under this Article  8, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay to the Indemnified Party  within thirty (30) days after such
determination, the amount of  any claim for indemnification made hereunder.
Upon the payment  in full of any claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated  to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person with 
respect to the subject matter of such claim.   (c) Notice by the Purchaser
of any claim for indemnification by the  Sellers must be given in writing to
Guilbert not later than June  30, 2004 (except for claims relating to Taxes,
for which such  notice must be given not later than one (1) month following
the  date of expiration of the applicable statute of limitation). The 
notice will set forth all relevant facts and will indicate which  section or
sections of this Agreement are alleged to have been  violated. Any notice
given by Purchaser later than the  applicable date referred to in this
paragraph (c) will be of no  effect and, in particular, will not give rise to
any recovery  under this Article 8. The June 30, 2004 time limit under this 
subsection shall be extended to ten (10) years from the Closing  Date with
respect to any claims arising out of Losses in  connection with a breach of
the representations given in Article  3.1.3(f) and 3.2.1.  8.4 COOPERATION
OF THE PARTIES  Each Party shall give the other Party its full cooperation
in defending all claims subject to indemnification hereunder, including
furnishing witnesses and documentary evidence to the extent available.   
-33-      8.5 DUTY TO MITIGATE  Each Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Loss to the extent practicable under the
circumstances and the failure to do so may cause the Party\'s right to
indemnification to be reduced.  8.6 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNITY
PAYMENTS  8.6.1 No claim for indemnification under Article 8.1 may be made,
and no payment in respect thereof shall be required unless (i) the amount for
which the Purchaser seeks payment in relation with any individual Loss or a
series of Losses, to the extent that they are caused by the same fact and
that they have an identical nature, exceeds Euro 100,000 and (ii) the
aggregate amount of Losses against which the Purchaser is entitled to be
indemnified exceeds Euro 8 million (it being understood that any Loss not
exceeding the Euro 100,000 threshold set forth in clause (i) of this Article
8.6 shall not be counted towards such Euro 8 million threshold) and then,
with regards to clause (ii) of this Article 8.6, only for the amount in
excess of Euro 5 million. In no event shall the aggregate amount to be paid
to the Purchaser hereunder exceed Euro 82.5 million.  8.6.2 Losses arising
out of or in connection with a breach by the Sellers of any of the
representations given in Articles 3.1.3(f) and 3.2.1 shall not be subject to
the limitations set forth in Article 8.6.1 above.  8.6.3 Losses arising out
of or in connection with a breach by the Sellers of the representations given
in Article 3.9 shall be counted in the maximum aggregate amount of Euro 82.5
million set forth in Article 8.6.1 (and, together with any other Losses,
shall not exceed Euro 82.5 million) but shall not be subject to the minimum
thresholds set forth in Article 8.6.1(i) and (ii).  8.6.4 Losses arising out
of or in connection with a breach by the Sellers of the covenants provided
for in Article 5.1.5 through and including Article 5.1.14 (only insofar as
such Article 5.1.14 relates to Articles 5.1.5 through and including Article
5.1.13), shall not be subject to any limitation on indemnity payment,
PROVIDED HOWEVER that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
any indemnification for any Loss referred to in this Article 8.6.4 to the
extent such Loss has been cured by the Sellers.  8.6.5 Losses arising out
of or in connection with a breach by the Sellers of Article 3.20 shall not be
subject to the maximum aggregate amount of Euro 82.5 million set forth in
Article 8.6.1, nor to the minimum thresholds set forth in Article 8.6.1(i)
and (ii).   ARTICLE 9 - NON COMPETITION AND NON SOLLICITATION
COVENANTS  9.1 The Sellers shall abstain and shall cause their Related
Persons to abstain:  (a) for a period from the Closing Date to the third

and the Subsidiaries are doing business as of the date of this  Agreement;
and  (b) for a period from the Closing Date to the first anniversary

for each Seller, should it cease to be a member of the PPR Group  9.2 For a
period of two years after the date of this Agreement, neither the Sellers nor
any of their Related Persons shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire
or induce any employee of the Companies or of any of the Subsidiaries, to

the Companies and the Subsidiaries; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Article 9.2 shall prohibit the Sellers or their Related Persons from
employing any Person who contacts them on his or her own one year after the
date of this Agreement, provided such Person had not been previously
solicited by the Sellers or any of their Related Persons.  9.3 For a period
of one year from the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser undertakes that
none of the employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries listed in
SCHEDULE 9.3 will be involved in any material respect in any operations of
the Purchaser and its subsidiaries in the contract stationers business,
whether such operations are current as of the date hereof or
created thereafter in any of the countries in which Guilbert is doing
business as of the date of this Agreement ; it being understood that nothing
in this Article 9.3 shall prohibit any of the persons listed in Schedule 9.3
from participating in any strategic discussions relating to the Purchaser\'s
European operations generally.   ARTICLE 10 - CONFIDENTIALITY  For a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, the Sellers shall maintain,
and shall cause their Related Persons to maintain, in strict confidence, all
information relating to the business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
(including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights and all
information other than information which is or becomes readily
obtainable from a public source through no fault of the Sellers). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers undertake not to
disclose, and shall cause their Related Persons not to disclose, to a third
party any information concerning the Companies or the Subsidiaries except (i)
when requested or required to disclose such information by law, by the
regulations of any relevant stock exchange, by any court or other judicial
authority or pursuant to any enquiry or investigation by any Governmental
Authority which is lawfully entitled to require any such disclosure; or (ii)
as authorized by the Purchaser and to the extent necessary in the ordinary
course of business and will not themselves use, and shall cause their Related
Persons not to use, such information.    -35-      ARTICLE 11 -

the Sellers;   (b) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers in the case of a
material  breach by the other Party of its covenants pursuant to this
Agreement  which such breach is not cured within 30 days of written notice 
thereof given by the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party; or   (c) by
either the Purchaser or the Sellers if the condition in Article  7.2(b) shall
have failed to have been satisfied at any time prior to  such termination so
long as such event continues to exist at the time  of termination.  12.2
EFFECT OF TERMINATION  If this Agreement is terminated as permitted under
Article 12.1, such termination shall be without liability to any Party to
this Agreement or any affiliate, shareholder, director, officer or
representative of such Party, except for liability arising from a willful
breach of this Agreement.  12.3 LAPSE  In the event that the condition set
forth in Article 7.1 has not been satisfied by 31 July, 2003, the Sellers and

Purchaser, as applicable, shall have fulfilled their or its obligations under
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 13 - MISCELLANEOUS  13.1 PUBLICITY  From the
