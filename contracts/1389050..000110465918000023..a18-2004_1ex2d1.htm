"), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.4, which Parent Shares
will be duly authorized, validly issued and non-assessable in accordance with
applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The limited liability company interests in Merger

(c) _Treatment of Partnership Owned Units and Parent Owned Partnership

outstanding.

 



 

(iii) The Common Units that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time
by MLP LP LLC and not canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ shall be
unaffected

 



      
 

 



 

by the Merger and shall remain outstanding as partnership interests in the
Surviving Entity.

 



 

(d) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Public Common Units
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a "
_Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Common Units represented in book-entry
form immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_, in each case to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, without interest.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units for
the Merger Consideration and paying any dividends or other distributions to
which a holder of Public Common Units is entitled pursuant to _Section
3.2(g)_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of
Public Common Units as of the Effective Time whose Common Units were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that, with respect to certificated Common Units, the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_) to the Exchange Agent) in such customary forms
as the Partnership and Parent may reasonably agree, including, as applicable,
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_) and Book-
Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Public Common Units whose Common Units are converting into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, Parent Shares (which
shares shall be uncertificated and registered in book-entry form), payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or
Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Following
the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash or other consideration as applicable
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(g)_ that may be payable from time to time following the Effective Time.
All Parent Shares and cash or other consideration payable in respect of any
dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
delivered by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article
III_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for

 



      
 

 



 

any purpose other than to pay such Merger Consideration and any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Public Common Units that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section
3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry Units and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent
(including with respect to Book-Entry Units), will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the number of Parent Shares representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to
receive in accordance with the provisions of this _Article III_, and (ii) a
check in the amount of such dividends or other distributions as such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_. Any and all Parent
Shares delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be
uncertificated and shall be registered in book-entry form. The Merger
Consideration and such other amounts as reflected in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or
any applicable documentation with respect to the surrender of Book-Entry
Units, and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Units. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate and Book-Entry Unit shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration and such other amounts as contemplated by _Section
3.2(g)_.

 



 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result
of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of Common
Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units
representing Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Laws. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry

 



      
 

 



 

Units are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article III_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration nine (9) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged his, her or its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration and the payment of any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ in respect of
such holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Partnership, the General Partner and the Managing GP shall not be liable
to any holder of Common Units for any Merger Consideration or other amount
duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property
Laws. Any Merger Consideration and other amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Common Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Shares issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Units until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section 3.2_. Following
such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable
Laws, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the
Parent Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such
surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any
such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such Parent Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Shares, all
Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractions of a Parent Share will be issued upon
the surrender of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, and such fractional interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in lieu
of receiving any fraction of a Parent Share, all fractions of Parent Shares to
which a holder of Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in the Merger would otherwise have been entitled shall be
aggregated and the resulting fraction of a Parent Share will be rounded up to
a whole Parent Share.

 



 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may

 



      
 

 



 

be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_ and pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, NewCo, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and
the Exchange Agent (and any of their successors and assigns) shall deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
without duplication, such amounts, if any and which may include Parent Shares,
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign tax Law (and to the extent deduction and
withholding is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in cash
or Parent Common Stock, as determined by Parent). To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of the Common Units in respect of whom such
withholding was made. If withholding is taken in Parent Shares, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing
authority.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Partnership Phantom Units; Termination of
Partnership Equity Plan_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each award of Partnership Phantom Units (whether
vested or unvested) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an award of
restricted stock units of Parent (" _Parent RSUs_ ") granted under the
Archrock, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan that covers a number of Parent Shares
equal to (i) the number of Partnership Phantom Units subject to such award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, with the product rounded down to the nearest whole Parent RSU. Each
such award of Parent RSUs shall be subject to the same vesting, forfeiture and
other terms and conditions (including form(s) of payment and distribution
equivalent rights (" _DERs_ "), if any) applicable to the converted award of
Partnership Phantom Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Partnership Phantom Units shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive
the Parent RSUs in accordance with this _Section 3.3(a)_.

 



 

(b) Any accrued value that a holder of Partnership Phantom Units has within a
DER account that is linked to Partnership Phantom Units as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall carry over and become attached to the
relevant new Parent RSU award.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Managing GP, the General Partner and the
Partnership shall take all actions, including, without limitation, providing
all notices and obtaining all required consents, and adopting any amendments
that are necessary and desirable to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.3_. Parent shall have the opportunity to
review and approve all such written materials in advance of their distribution
to

 



      
 

 



 

holders of Partnership Phantom Units, which approval shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld.

 



 

(d) Parent shall file a Form S-8 registration statement covering the Parent
Shares issuable pursuant to the Parent RSUs and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus associated
therewith) for so long as such Parent RSUs remain outstanding. The Partnership
shall cooperate and reasonably assist Parent in the preparation of such
registration statement.

 



 

(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Partnership shall
file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 registration statement filed
by the Partnership on May 12, 2017, deregistering all Common Units thereunder.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the number of outstanding Common Units or Parent Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of units or shares or a different class or
series by reason of the occurrence or record date of any unit or share
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up,
unit or share distribution, combination, exchange of units or shares or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any
other similar dependent item, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit or share dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit or
share distribution, combination, exchange of units or shares or similar
transaction and to provide the holders of Common Units the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.4_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize any party hereto to affect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Partnership, the General Partner and the
Managing GP and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Partnership, the General Partner and the Managing GP,

reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies generally and by
general principles of equity (whether applied in a Proceeding at law or in
equity) (collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Partnership,
the General Partner or the Managing GP nor the consummation by the
Partnership, the General Partner and the Managing GP of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor compliance by the Partnership, the General

_Contract_ ") or Partnership Permit, to which the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected or (iii) result in the
exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any material asset of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of _clause (ii)_
of this sentence, for such violations, conflicts, losses, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or Liens that have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except for the approval by the Managing GP Board, which was obtained prior
to the execution of this Agreement, the Partnership Unitholder Approval is the
only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of Partnership
Interests that is necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the

Controls_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since
December 31, 2014 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Partnership SEC Documents_ "). The Partnership SEC
Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of Partnership
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other Partnership SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
applicable to such Partnership SEC Documents, and none of the Partnership SEC
Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated
in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except

 



      
 

 



 

as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners capital for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Partnership and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or

consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership prepared in accordance with GAAP
or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) No Partnership Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding
comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Partnership SEC Documents. No enforcement action has been
initiated against the Partnership relating to disclosures contained or omitted
from any Partnership SEC Document.

 



 

(e) The Partnership makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has
devised and maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, in all
material respects, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange
Act. The Partnership has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the
applicable listing standards of NASDAQ. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Managing GPs principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Partnerships
auditors and the audit committee of the Managing GP Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships auditors any
material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Partnerships internal controls.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Since January 1, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Managing GP have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as
disclosed in a Partnership SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date
of this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial
reporting.

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing with respect to the

Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments, decrees or similar

law, statute, tariff, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, stipulation, determination, award or decree or agency requirement
of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority, including common law

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,

to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _Partnership
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Partnership Permits
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All Partnership Permits
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and

or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or

any Partnership Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable
Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend, any
Partnership Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The
Partnership Permits will not be subject to suspension, modification,
revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except,
in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No Proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, threatened with respect to any alleged failure
by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to have any material Permit
necessary for the operation of any asset or the conduct of their businesses or
to be in compliance therewith, except, in each case, as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption Laws that are
applicable to the Partnership or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has, to the knowledge
of the Partnership, been given written notice by any Governmental Authority of

which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or (iii) result
in the exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any material asset
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ of

publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). The Parent SEC Documents,
as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the Parent SEC

the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and
none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial

 



      
 

 



 

position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof

consistent with past practice and (iii) for liabilities and obligations
incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments
from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents. No enforcement action has been initiated against Parent
relating to disclosures contained or omitted from any Parent SEC Document.

paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the applicable listing
standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board

controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls.

financial officer of Parent have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its

 



      
 

 



 

officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as
disclosed in a Parent SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial
reporting.

full force and effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing, except where such suspension or
cancellation has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and

delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in

compliance therewith, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement; Equityholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Partnership and Parent shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and (ii) the Partnership and Parent shall jointly prepare and
Parent shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the Partnership and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and keep the Registration Statement effective
for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Partnership and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Limited
Partners and the Parent Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent without providing the Partnership
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to the Partnership or Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by
the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that
any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable
Laws, disseminated to the Limited Partners and the Parent Stockholders.

 



      
 

 



 

The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the
staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.1(d)_, the Partnership shall, as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of the Limited Partners (the " _Partnership
Unitholder Meeting_ ") (which Partnership Unitholder Meeting date shall be no
later than thirty-five (35) days after the date that the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act) for the purpose of
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval. Subject to _Section 6.3_, the
Partnership shall, through the Managing GP Board and the Conflicts Committee,
recommend to the Limited Partners approval of this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Partnership Board Recommendation_ ") and use the Partnerships
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Limited Partners the Partnership
Unitholder Approval. The Joint Proxy Statement shall include, subject to
_Section 6.3_, the Partnership Board Recommendation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Partnerships obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not be affected by the
withdrawal or modification by the Conflicts Committee or the Managing GP Board
of the Partnership Board Recommendation or any other action by the Conflicts
Committee or the Managing GP Board with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or adjourn the
Partnership Unitholder Meeting (A) to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (B) for the absence
of quorum, (C) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement that the Conflicts
Committee has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is
necessary under applicable Laws is provided to the Limited Partners within the
minimum amount of time reasonably practicable prior to the Partnership
Unitholder Meeting, and (D) if the Partnership has delivered any notice
contemplated by _Section 6.3(b)_ and the time periods contemplated by
_Section 6.3(b)_ have not expired; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case, the Partnership shall not be permitted to postpone or adjourn the
Partnership Unitholder Meeting for more than ten (10) Business Days later than
the most recently adjourned meeting or to a date after the date that is two
(2) Business Days prior to the Outside Date. The Partnership shall adjourn the
Partnership Unitholder Meeting at the request of Parent (but in no event for
more than thirty (30) days from the date the Partnership Unitholder Meeting
was originally scheduled to convene) (A) to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval or (B) for the
absence of quorum. Without the written consent of the Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no matter shall be
submitted for action at the Partnership Unitholder Meeting except the approval
of this Agreement and matters reasonably related to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 6.1(d)_, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a special meeting of the Parent Stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholder
Meeting_ ") (which Parent Stockholder Meeting date shall be no later than

 



      
 

 



 

thirty-five (35) days after the date that the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act) for the purpose of obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall include in the Joint Proxy Statement
Parents recommendation, through the Parent Board, that the Parent
Stockholders approve the Parent Stock Issuance (the " _Parent Board
Recommendation_ ") and use Parents reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
Parent Stockholders the Parent Stockholder Approval. The Joint Proxy Statement
shall include the Parent Board Recommendation. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the obligations of Parent set forth in the first sentence of
this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not be affected by any action by the Parent Board
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting (A) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval, (B) for the absence of quorum and (C) to the extent reasonably
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement that the Parent Board has determined after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Laws is provided to Parent
Stockholders within the minimum amount of time reasonably practicable prior to
the Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case,
Parent shall not be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder
Meeting for more than ten (10) Business Days later than the most recently
adjourned meeting or to a date after the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date. The Parent shall adjourn the Parent Stockholder
Meeting at the request of the Partnership (but in no event for more than
thirty (30) days from the date the Parent Stockholder Meeting was originally
scheduled to convene) (A) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval or (B) for the absence of quorum.
Without the written consent of the Conflicts Committee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no matter shall be submitted
for action at the Parent Stockholder Meeting except the approval of the Parent
Stock Issuance and matters reasonably related to the Parent Stock Issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Stockholder Meeting may be combined
with the Parents 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, provided that no other
matters shall be submitted for action at such meeting other than the Parent
Stock Issuance, election of the Parents directors, the appointment of the
Parents auditors and any required stockholder proposals, without the written
consent of the Conflicts Committee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), and provided further that such combination does not
cause the Parent Stockholder Meeting to occur materially later than it would
have occurred without such combination.

 



 

(d) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold the
Partnership Unitholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on the same
day.

 



 

(e) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
VIII_, the Partnership shall submit this Agreement to the Limited Partners for
approval at the Partnership Unitholder Meeting even if the Managing GP Board
or the Conflicts Committee shall have effected a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(f) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
VIII_, Parent shall submit the Parent Stock Issuance for approval at the
Parent Stockholder Meeting.

cause their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,

(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Partnership Board Recommendation
or (ii) fail to include the Partnership Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement (the taking of any such action being referred to as a "
_Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Partnerships, the General Partners or the Managing GPs
Representatives, other than any violation caused by or at the direction of
Parent, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the

compliance in all material respects with this _Section 6.3(b)_, the Managing
GP Board (but only with the written approval of the Conflicts Committee) or
the Conflicts Committee may make a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change
if the Managing GP Board or the Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Laws if:

 



 

(i) the Managing GP Board or the Conflicts Committee, as applicable, has
provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in reasonable detail the
material events giving rise to the proposed Partnership Adverse Recommendation
Change at least three (3) days in advance of its intention to take such action
with respect to a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the
time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are fewer than three
(3) days prior to the Partnership Unitholder Meeting, in which case the
Managing GP Board or the Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall provide as
much notice as is practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Partnership Notice Period_ "); and

 



 

(ii) during the Partnership Notice Period, the Managing GP Board or the
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, has negotiated, and has used its
reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to effect such Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with its duties under the
Partnership Agreement and applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Conflicts Committee shall take into account all changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in determining whether the failure to effect such
Partnership Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with its duties under the
Partnership Agreement and applicable Laws.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations

the Managing GP and their Representatives) to any confidential information
relating to a possible Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by this
_Section 6.3_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage the submission of an Alternative Proposal (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any
information with respect to, any proposal or offer from any Person relating
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal;
(iii) knowingly assist, participate in or facilitate in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing, (iv) enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or (v) (A) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to the Partnership, the Parent Board Recommendation, (B) fail to
include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (C)
authorize, approve, declare advisable, adopt or recommend or propose to
publicly authorize, approve, declare advisable, adopt or recommend, any

arrangement or understanding with respect to any Alternative Proposal (other

Proposal has been publicly known (including by way of media rumors or
speculations with respect thereto) or been delivered to Parent, fail to
publicly recommend against such Alternative Proposal within ten (10) Business
Days of a request by the Partnership and to reaffirm the Parent Board
Recommendation within such ten (10) Business Day period upon such request.
Parent will notify the Conflicts Committee immediately if any Person makes any
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to an Alternative Proposal
and the terms of any such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact (the taking of
any action described in clause (v) being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by Parents Subsidiaries or
Parents Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_
by Parent.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(c)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval, (i) Parent has received a written Alternative
Proposal that the Parent Board believes is bona fide, (ii) the Parent Board,
after consultation with Parents financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with Parents outside legal counsel, failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Laws and (iii) such
Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of this _Section
6.3_, then Parent may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish
information, including confidential information, with respect to Parent and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations

 



      
 

 



 

regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Parent
and its respective Subsidiaries will not, and will use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to, disclose any non-
public information to such Person unless Parent has, or first enters into, an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y) Parent will
provide to the Partnership, the General Partner and the Managing GP non-public
information with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries that was not
previously provided or made available to the Partnership, the General Partner
and the Managing GP prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or
making available such non-public information to such other Person.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and subject to compliance
in all material respects with this _Section 6.3(e)_, the Parent Board may (x)
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) solely in the case of
_Section 6.3(e)(i)_ terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1
(c)(iii)_, in each case:

 



 

(i) if Parent has received a written Alternative Proposal that the Parent
Board believes is bona fide and the Parent Board, after consultation with
Parents financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and,
after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel, failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Laws;

 



 

(ii) if the Parent Board has provided prior written notice to the Partnership
(A) stating that the Parent Board, after consultation with Parents financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) including a
description of the material terms of such Alternative Proposal, at least three
(3) days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than three (3) days prior to the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, in which case the Parent Board shall provide as
much notice as is practicable (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of an Alternative Proposal, if applicable,
shall require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 6.3(e)_ and a new Parent
Notice Period, except that such new Parent Notice Period in connection with
any material amendment to the terms of an Alternative Proposal shall be for
two (2) days from the time the Partnership receives such notice (as opposed to
three (3) days) (the period inclusive of all such days, the " _Parent Notice
Period_ "); and

 



 

(iii) if, during the Parent Notice Period, the Parent Board has negotiated,
and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause Parents financial advisors
and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with the Partnership, the General
Partner and the Managing GP in good faith (to the extent the Partnership, the
General Partner and the Managing GP desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parent Board shall take into account all changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Partnership in determining whether such Alternative
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

Board, as applicable, from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal
if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
constitute a violation of applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with
_Section 6.3(e)_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, on the one

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take the lead
in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with obtaining such clearances; _provided_ , _however_ , that

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as may be required by applicable Laws or by any applicable listing
agreement with the NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, as determined in the good

Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives; _provided_ , that such access shall be provided on a basis
that minimizes the disruption to the operations of the requested party and its
Representatives. Subject to applicable Laws, during such period, Parent shall
furnish promptly to the Partnership (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or
received by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal, state or
foreign Laws (including pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and

shall have an obligation to provide access to any information the disclosure
of which the other party has concluded may jeopardize any privilege available
to such party or any of its Affiliates relating to such information or would
be in violation of a confidentiality obligation binding on such party or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

applicable Laws, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree
to (i) indemnify and hold harmless against any reasonable costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as

 



      
 

 



 

telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Proceeding, including any Proceeding relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Person),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and, upon receipt by
Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay
such amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is
not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of expenses with respect
to each of the foregoing to, all Indemnified Persons and (ii) honor the
provisions regarding elimination of liability of officers and directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the Partnership, the
General Partner and the Managing GP immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and ensure that the Organizational Documents of the Partnership, the General
Partner and the Managing GP or any of their respective successors or assigns,
if applicable, shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers and employees of the Partnership, the General Partner and the
Managing GP than are presently set forth in such Organizational Documents. Any
right of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_ shall not be
amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided
herein, and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Person and their
respective heirs and representatives against Parent and the Managing GP and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time
Parents current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute
therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ more than an amount per year
equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by Parent for such insurance
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent would be required to expend more than
the Maximum Amount, Parent shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
as is available for the Maximum Amount. If Parent in its sole discretion
elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent under this _Section
6.7(b)_, Parent may (but shall be under no obligation to), prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in
their capacity as such; _provided_ , that in no event shall the cost of such
policy exceed the Maximum Amount.

 



 

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership, the General Partner and the
Managing GP, any indemnification agreements, or the DLLCA and DRULPA. The
provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives. If Parent and/or the Managing GP, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or
assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary,
a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and/or the Managing GP shall assume the obligations of Parent and the Managing
GP set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the

effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be the obligation of the
respective party incurring such fees and expenses, except Parent and the
Partnership shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy Statement.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the

permitted under applicable Laws) to cause any dispositions of Common Units

of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will become

(a) After the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Partnership shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration
of any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock and
Partnership Interests and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto,
it being the intention of the parties that holders of Partnership Interests
shall not receive, for any quarter, distributions both in respect of
Partnership Interests and also dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock
that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they shall
receive for any such quarter either: (a) only distributions in respect of
Partnership Interests or (b) only dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock
that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Managing GP Board shall determine and
declare quarterly distributions in the ordinary course and consistent with
past practice, including with

 



      
 

 



 

timing consistent with past practice; _provided_ , that the amount of any such
quarterly distribution declared prior to the Effective Time shall not exceed
$0.285 per Common Unit.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time

permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall not and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action intended to cause the Managing GP to,
without the consent of a majority of the then existing members of the
Conflicts Committee, eliminate the Conflicts Committee, revoke or diminish the
authority of the Conflicts Committee or remove or cause the removal of any
director of the Managing GP that is a member of the Conflicts Committee either
as a director or as a member of such committee. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 6.12_ shall not apply to the filling, in accordance with the
provisions of the Managing GP LLC Agreement, of any vacancies caused by the
resignation, death or incapacity of any such director.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Performance by Managing GP_. Parent will cause the Managing GP
to cause the General Partner, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that actions or inactions by the Partnership, the
General Partner and the Managing GP and their respective Subsidiaries shall
not be deemed to be breaches or violations or failures to perform by Parent of
any of the provisions of this Agreement unless such action or inaction was or
was not taken, in either case, at the direction of Parent.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Cooperation with Debt and Equity Financing_. From and after the
date of this Agreement, the Partnership shall, and the Partnership shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to provide all customary cooperation (including
providing reasonably available financial and other information regarding the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering documents
and to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any bank debt
financing or any capital markets debt or equity financing, any repayment,
restructuring or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the Merger; it being understood that the arrangement of any bank debt
financing or any capital markets debt financing or the repayment,
restructuring or refinancing of any debt shall not be a condition to Parents
or Merger Subs obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Managing GP, the General Partner, the Partnership and their
respective Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses or damages
actually suffered or incurred by them directly in connection with the
arrangement of any such bank debt financing or any capital markets debt
financing.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Tax Treatment_. For United States federal income tax purposes
(and for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows
the United States federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat
the Merger (a) with respect to the holders of Public Common Units, as a
taxable sale of such Public Common Units to NewCo and (b) with respect to
NewCo, as if NewCo purchased the Parent Shares issued pursuant to the Merger
for fair market value with cash deemed contributed to NewCo by Parent, through
one or more intermediate entities, and then as a purchase by NewCo of the
Public Common Units from the

 



      
 

 



 

holders of such Common Units in exchange for such Parent Shares. The parties
will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will
not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of
any Proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by
applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final administrative
decision by the relevant Governmental Authority.

hereby or related thereto. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or related thereto, Parent and the Parent Board shall
grant such approvals and shall use reasonable best efforts to take such
actions so that the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and
the Parent Stock Issuance, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock
Issuance.

Partner shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Partnership and the
General Partner and/or their directors (as applicable) relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Partnership
and the General Partner shall in any event control such defense and/or
settlement and shall not be required to provide information if doing so would

party or threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other
applicable legal privilege.

5.2(a)_ shall be true and correct in all respects, other than immaterial
misstatements or omissions, both when made and at and as of the Closing Date,
as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case as of such date); and (iii) all other
representations and warranties of Parent set forth herein shall be true and
correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as
of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date), except, in the case of this _clause (iii)_ ,
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any individual representation or
warranty, other than in _Sections 5.5_ , _5.6_ and _5.9_ and the definition of
Parent Material Contract in _Section 5.11_) does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership shall have received a certificate
signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing
Date. The Partnership shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_.

 



 

(a) None of the Partnership, the General Partner nor the Managing GP may rely
on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was due to
the failure of either such party to perform and comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements in this Agreement to be performed
or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be,
to be satisfied if such failure was due to the failure of either such party to
perform and comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements
in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

authorized by the Parent Board and the Conflicts Committee, respectively.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either of the Partnership or Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before September 30,
2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available (A) to the Partnership or Parent, if the failure to satisfy such
condition was due to the failure of, in the case of the Partnership, the
Partnership, the General Partner or the Managing GP, or, in the case of
Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, to perform and comply in all material respects
with the covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing or (B) to the Partnership or Parent if, in the case of Parent,
the Partnership, the General Partner or the Managing GP, or, in the case of
the Partnership, Parent or Merger Sub, has filed (and is then pursuing) an
action seeking specific performance as permitted by _Section 9.9_;

 



 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to the Partnership or Parent if such
Restraint was due to the failure of, in the case of the Partnership, the
Partnership, the General Partner or the Managing GP, or, in the case of
Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

 



 

(iii) if the Partnership Unitholder Meeting and any postponements or
adjournments thereof shall have concluded and the Partnership Unitholder
Approval shall not have been obtained; or

 



 

(iv) if the Parent Stockholder Meeting and any postponements or adjournments
thereof shall have concluded and the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not

(c) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred prior
to the Partnership Unitholder Meeting, unless Partnership Unitholder Approval
shall have been obtained;

 



 

(ii) if the Partnership, the General Partner or the Managing GP shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Partnership, the General Partner or the
Managing GP set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach
or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date)
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the
Partnership, the General Partner or the Managing GP within thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or failure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ if Parent or Merger Sub
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) prior to the receipt of Parent Stockholder Approval, in order to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have complied in all material respects with
Section 6.3(c) and _Section 6.3(e)_.

 



 

(d) by the Partnership (which termination may be effected for the Partnership
by the Conflicts Committee without the consent, authorization or approval of
the Managing GP Board):

 



 

(i) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in Section 6.3(c) in any material respect; or

 



 

(ii) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (other than in Section 6.3(c)) (or if any of the representations or
warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which
breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by Parent within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice
from the Partnership of such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Partnership shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the Partnership, the General Partner or the
Managing GP is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void (other than the provisions in the last sentence of
_Section 6.6_ , the provisions in _Section 6.8_, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement), and, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.2_,
there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Partnership, the General Partner and the Managing GP or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from (a) its obligation to pay the
Parent Expenses, the Partnership Expenses or the Partnership Termination Fee,
as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to _Section 8.3_, (b) any
liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement when required pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
any liability for intentional fraud or a willful breach of any covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section
8.2_, " _willful breach_ " shall mean a material breach of this Agreement that
is a consequence of a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act by the
breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act (or the failure
to take such act) would (x) cause a material breach of this Agreement and (y)
prevent or materially delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Managing GP, the General Partner or the Partnership have any
liability for any matter set forth in the proviso of the preceding sentence
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Managing GP, the General
Partner, the Partnership, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives at the direction of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date), then Parent

immediately available funds to an account designated by the Partnership an
amount equal to the Partnership Expenses, and such payment shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (No Parent Stockholder
Approval), then Parent shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated

available funds to an account designated by the Partnership an amount equal to
the Partnership Termination Fee, and such payment shall be made within five
(5) Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ (Partnership Uncured Breach), then the Partnership shall pay to
the Parent (or its designated Affiliate) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent an amount equal to the
Parent Expenses, and such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days
after such termination.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_ (Parent Superior Proposal), then Parent shall pay to the
Partnership (or its designated Affiliate) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Partnership an amount equal to
the Partnership Termination Fee, and such payment shall be made within five
(5) Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(f) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Proposal is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date) or _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_
(No Parent Stockholder Approval) and (iii) at any time on or prior to the
twelve (12) month anniversary of such termination, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into a definitive agreement in respect of an
Alternative Proposal or consummated an Alternative Proposal (whether or not
such Alternative Proposal is the same Alternative Proposal referred to in sub-
clause (i) above), Parent shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated
Affiliate), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Partnership, the Partnership Termination Fee, upon the
earlier of the public announcement that Parent has entered into such
definitive agreement or the consummation of any such transaction; provided,
that the payment by Parent of the Partnership Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ shall not relieve Parent from any liability or damage resulting
from a willful breach as defined in _Section 8.2_.

 



 

(g) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Partnership Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. In the event that Parent pays the Partnership
Expenses pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.3_, then any Partnership Termination Fee required to be paid by
Parent under this _Section 8.3_ shall be reduced by the amount of the
Partnership Expenses previously paid.

 



 

(h) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3
_are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Partnership, the General Partner and the
Managing GP would not enter into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the Parent Expenses, the Partnership Expenses or the Partnership
Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy with respect
thereto, except as expressly set forth in _Section 8.2_.

 



 

(i) Any amount of Partnership Termination Fee received by the Partnership (or
its designated Affiliate) (less any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants) incurred by the Partnership, the General Partner, the
Managing GP and their respective controlled Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement) will be distributed to the Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders by
a special distribution, in any manner as may be determined by the Conflicts
Committee, and Parent agrees that it will (and will cause the General Partner,
the Managing GP, MLP LP LLC and any of their respective Subsidiaries that own
any Partnership Interests to) waive any rights it or they may have to receive
such special distribution.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._ The representations, warranties and agreements
in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall
terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.2_ or _Section 8.3_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in
_Article I_, _Article II_, _Article III,_ the last sentence of _Section
6.6_, _Section 6.8_, _Section 6.10_ and _Article IX _and any other
agreement in this Agreement that contemplates performance after the Effective
Time shall survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and the
Parent Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by the Parent Board and the Managing GP Board;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Managing GP Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has been approved by the Conflicts Committee;
_provided_ , _further_ , that following receipt of the Partnership Unitholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or
change to the provisions of this Agreement which by applicable Laws or stock
exchange rule would require further approval by the Limited Partners or Parent
Stockholders, as applicable, without such approval.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Managing GP Board Consent_. Unless otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval or consent of
the Partnership, the

 



      
 

 



 

General Partner or the Managing GP is required pursuant to this Agreement,
such determination, decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the
Managing GP Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Managing GP Board may not
take or authorize any such action unless it has been approved in writing by
the Conflicts Committee.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Laws, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Managing GP Board may not take or
authorize any such action unless it has been approved in writing by the
Conflicts Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Partnership, the General Partner, the Managing GP, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (including any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent created after the date of this Agreement but prior
to the Effective Time), but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any
of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 9.5_ shall be
null, void and ineffective.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and any certificates delivered by any party pursuant to this agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall
not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights (including
third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except
for, in the case of _clause (b)_ of this sentence, the provisions of _Section
6.7_ and _Section 9.12_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.12_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, any financing sources or lender providing financing in
connection with the Merger.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto consents to service being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.9_, irrevocably submits
with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section
9.8_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Laws,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto expressly acknowledges that
the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State
of Delaware and of the United States of America; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each such partys consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this
Section 9.8(b)is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 9.8(b)and
shall not be deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State
of Delaware other than for such purpose.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction

 



      
 

 



 

or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 9.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (it
being understood that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the parties
hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for specific performance or
other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each party further agrees that
no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.9_, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other

by reason of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
