ARTICLE III

  

Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares

  

  

Section 3.01. Conversion of Shares.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any Shares, or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub: (i) each issued and outstanding common share of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;
(ii) any Shares that are owned by the Company shall be automatically canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor; (iii) any Shares that are owned by Acquiror or Merger
Sub (including the Rollover Shares following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Rollover Agreement) shall be automatically canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor; and (iv) each issued and outstanding Share (other than the
Rollover Shares, any Shares to be cancelled in accordance with subclauses (ii)
or (iii) above and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive a portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration equal to the quotient derived by

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

dividing (A) the Aggregate Merger Consideration by (B) the Aggregate Share
Count (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"), payable without interest to the
holder thereof in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Share (other than the Rollover Shares, any
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a)(ii) or Section
3.01(a)(iii) and any Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor, without interest, upon
delivery of the Letter of Transmittal in accordance with Section 3.03.

  

  

Section 3.02. Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Dissenting Shares") held by a shareholder who has properly exercised such
shareholder's right to dissent in accordance with the Kentucky Dissenters'
Rights Statute (a "Dissenting Shareholder"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.01. At the Effective Time, (i) each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the Kentucky
Dissenters' Rights Statute and (ii) such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.02(a), if any Dissenting
Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect
or otherwise) his, her or its rights to receive payment for the fair value of
such Dissenting Shareholder's Shares under the Kentucky Dissenters' Rights
Statute, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, such Dissenting Shareholder's Shares (i) shall no longer be deemed
Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted
automatically into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in this ARTICLE III.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any demands for
payment with respect to any Shares pursuant to the Kentucky Dissenters' Rights
Statute, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the Kentucky Dissenters' Rights Statute and received by the
Company, and shall provide promptly copies of any written notice or
correspondence from any putative dissenter and/or dissenter's counsel and (ii)
the opportunity to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters' rights under the Kentucky
Dissenters' Rights Statute. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, offer to make, agree to make or make any payment
with respect to any demands for dissenters' rights with respect to Shares or
offer to settle or compromise any such demands.

  

  

Section 3.03. Payment of Merger Consideration.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, Acquiror shall appoint a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Shareholders' Representative to act as paying agent
hereunder (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of distributing the Initial
Merger Consideration payable to the Pre-Closing Shareholders that are not
Dissenting Shareholders pursuant to this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 3.03 and the payment, if any, pursuant to Section 3.05(g). No later
than one (1) business day following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in trust for the
benefit of the Pre-Closing Shareholders that are not Dissenting Shareholders
in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Initial Merger
Consideration Payment, minus (i) an amount equal to the Initial Per Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Dissenting Shares, minus (ii)
an amount equal to the Initial Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Rollover Shares (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Pre-Closing Shareholder: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in such form as the parties hereto shall mutually agree and
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of a properly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent along with the
Certificates, if applicable) (the "Letter of Transmittal"); and (ii)
instructions for completing the Letter of Transmittal and effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or cancellation of the Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest. Promptly following the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal
and other documents to the Paying Agent, properly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and, in the case of a
holder of a Certificate, the surrender to the Paying Agent by such holder of
his, her or its Certificates for cancellation (a "Satisfactory Tender"), the
Paying Agent shall pay from the Payment Fund to such Pre-Closing Shareholder
an amount equal to (x) the number of Shares (not including any Rollover
Shares) held by such Pre-Closing Shareholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any Book-Entry Shares), multiplied by (y) the
Initial Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered
shall immediately be canceled and the Book-Entry Shares to which the Letter of
Transmittal relates shall be canceled, as applicable. If payment of the
Initial Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered or in whose
name the Book-Entry Shares are registered in the books and records of the
Company, as applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Initial Per Share Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Shares or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable and, in
the case of a holder of a Certificate, the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by separate stock powers) and shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Until a Satisfactory Tender has been
made, each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares (not including the Rollover Shares)
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this ARTICLE III, without interest.

  

  

(c) The Paying Agent shall review each submitted Letter of Transmittal (and,
as applicable, Certificate) against the books and records of the Company to
verify the accuracy and completeness thereof and shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, promptly following receipt thereof, originals of each
Letter of Transmittal (and, as applicable, Certificate) delivered to the
Paying Agent by the Pre-Closing Shareholders.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) The Initial Per Share Merger Consideration paid in respect of the Shares
(not including the Rollover Shares) upon a Satisfactory Tender in accordance
with the terms of this ARTICLE III, together with the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any remaining amounts of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
paid subsequently in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on
the records of the Company or the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 3.03(g), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 3.03 shall also apply to Dissenting Shares
that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of Acquiror under
this Section 3.03 shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the
holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares
the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
hereto.

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in the form
required by Acquiror) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares (not including the Rollover
Shares) formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
ARTICLE III.

  

  

(g) Termination of Fund. Upon the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been
made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration that may be payable upon a
Satisfactory Tender, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(h) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Per Share Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) Withholding Taxes. Each of Acquiror, Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments required to
be made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 3.04. Closing Statement. At least three (3) business days before
Closing (the "Estimate Statement Delivery Date"), the Company shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Acquiror an estimated balance sheet of the
Company as of the end of business on the Closing Date and prior to the
consummation of the Merger (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and a
statement (the "Estimate Statement") setting forth the Company's good faith
estimate of Working Capital derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
("Estimated Closing Working Capital"). The Company shall provide Acquiror with
copies of or reasonable access to such books and records as are reasonably
necessary for purposes of verifying the amounts set forth in the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimate Statement. The Company shall use the
latest available information as of the Estimate Statement Delivery Date to
prepare the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and to calculate the Estimated
Closing Working Capital. The preparation of the Estimate Statement shall be
for the purpose of determining the difference between Estimated Closing
Working Capital and Target Working Capital and shall be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles.

  

  

Section 3.05. Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation, at its expense,
to retain KPMG LLP (or if KPMG LLP is unable or unwilling to accept its
mandate, an independent nationally recognized accounting firm to be selected
by Acquiror), who shall assist Acquiror in preparing, in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, and delivering to the Shareholders' Representative an
unaudited balance sheet of the Company (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a
closing statement (the "Closing Statement") and a certificate based on such
Closing Statement setting forth Acquiror's calculation of Working Capital
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet ("Closing Working Capital"). The
preparation of the Closing Statement shall be for the purpose of determining
the difference between Estimated Closing Working Capital and Closing Working
Capital and shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

  

  

(b) If Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, the
amount of such excess (the "Final Working Capital Shortfall") shall be
released from the Escrow Fund to Acquiror in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 3.05(f) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. If Final
Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital, Acquiror shall pay
to the Paying Agent, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
3.05(f), the amount of such excess (the "Final Working Capital Excess") as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. "Final Closing Balance Sheet" and "Final
Working Capital" mean, respectively, the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Working Capital (i) as shown in Acquiror's calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 3.05(a) if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly
delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(c); or (ii) if such a notice of
disagreement is delivered, (A) as

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

agreed by Acquiror and the Company pursuant to Section 3.05(d) or (B) in the
absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accountants' calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 3.05(d); provided, however, that in no event shall Final
Working Capital be more than the Shareholders' Representative's calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(c) or less than
Acquiror's calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 3.05(a).

  

  

(c) If the Shareholders' Representative disagrees with the amounts reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet or Acquiror's calculation of Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(a), the Shareholders'
Representative may, within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, deliver a notice to Acquiror disputing such amounts reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet and/or disagreeing with such calculation of Closing
Working Capital and setting forth the Shareholders' Representative's
calculation of such amounts. Any such notice of dispute or disagreement shall
specify those items or amounts as to which the Shareholders' Representative
disagrees, and the Shareholders' Representative shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to Section 3.05(a).

  

  

(d) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
3.05(c), Acquiror and Shareholders' Representative shall, during the thirty
(30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as
may be required, the proper amounts set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet and
the amount of Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than the
amount thereof shown in Acquiror's calculation delivered pursuant to Section
3.05(a) nor more than the amount thereof shown in Shareholders'
Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(c). If the
parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the computation
of Closing Working Capital, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the
resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If
during such period, Acquiror and Shareholders' Representative are unable to
reach an agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP (or
if Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to accept its mandate, an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon
by Acquiror and Shareholders' Representative) (in either such case, the
"Accountants") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for
the purpose of determining the proper amounts on the Closing Balance Sheet and
calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making such
determination and calculation, the Accountants shall be functioning as an
expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such determination and
calculation, the Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and Acquiror's calculation of
Closing Working Capital as to which Shareholders' Representative has
disagreed. With respect to each disputed item, such determination and
calculation, if not in accordance with the position of Acquiror or the
Shareholders' Representative, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less
than the lower of the amounts shown in Acquiror's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 3.05(a) or the Shareholders' Representative's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(c) in respect of each such disputed item.
The Accountants shall deliver to Acquiror and Shareholders' Representative, as
promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from
the date of engagement of the Accountants), a report setting forth such
determination and calculation, which shall set forth the Accountant's
calculation of Closing Working Capital,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

which shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in Acquiror's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.05(a) nor more than the amount
thereof shown in Shareholders' Representative's calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 3.05(c). Such report shall be final and binding upon Acquiror and
Shareholders' Representative on behalf of each Pre-Closing Shareholder. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Accountants' review and report in respect
hereof (the "Accountants' Fees") shall be borne equally by Acquiror and by the
Shareholders' Representative. Any Accountants' Fees payable by the
Shareholders' Representative shall be paid by a release of funds from the
Escrow Fund to Acquiror, without interest.

  

  

(e) Acquiror and Shareholders' Representative shall, and shall cause their
respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this Section
3.05, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

  

  

(f) Any payment pursuant to Section 3.05(b) shall be made within five (5)
business days after Final Working Capital has been determined by wire transfer
by Acquiror or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, of immediately available
funds to the account of Acquiror or the Paying Agent, as applicable, as may be
designated in writing by such other party prior to such transfer. The amount
of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.05 shall bear interest at
One and One Half Percent (1.5%) per annum from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the
same time as the payment to which it relates.

  

  

(g) Promptly following receipt by the Paying Agent of any payment to be made
to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.05, the Paying Agent shall pay
to each Pre-Closing Shareholder who has made a Satisfactory Tender an amount
equal to (i) the number of Shares (including any Rollover Shares) held by such
Pre-Closing Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
Book-Entry Shares), multiplied by (y) the Per Share Adjustment Amount.

  

  

Section 3.06. Escrow Fund. On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, for the
benefit of the Pre-Closing Shareholders, deposit a cash amount equal to the
Escrow Amount to an account designated by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Fund"), such deposit to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the
Escrow Agreement. Until the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Fund shall be
available solely for purposes of the purchase price adjustment pursuant to
Section 3.05, to compensate Acquiror pursuant to the indemnification
obligations of the Pre-Closing Shareholders in accordance with and subject to
ARTICLE X and for other payments expressly identified in this Agreement as
payable out of the Escrow Fund.

  

  

Section 3.07. 2011 Closing Adjustment. The "2011 Closing Adjustment" shall
equal either:

  

  

(a) Zero Dollars ($0) if:

  

  

(i) the Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2010;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(ii) (A) prior to January 1, 2011, the Company materially breaches, and does
not timely cure, any covenant under Sections 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 or 6.06
hereof, considering that for the purposes of this Section 3.07(a)(ii), time is
of the essence with respect to such covenants; (B) prior to January 1, 2011,
Acquiror does not materially breach any covenant under Section 6.06 hereof;
and (C) the proceeds of the Debt Financing are not available in full on or
before December 31, 2010 pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or such other
definitive agreements in respect of the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or alternative financing pursuant to Section 6.06(a)); or

  

  

(iii) the waiting period required under the HSR Act has not expired before
January 1, 2011; or

  

  

(b) Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) if none of the conditions in clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 3.07(a) are satisfied.

has been established and maintained, in all material respects, in accordance

(d) The Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the
Code are so qualified and the trusts maintained pursuant thereto are exempt
from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code, and nothing has
occurred with respect to the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan which
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or
the Code.

  

  

(e) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits which have been asserted
or instituted against the Employee Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the
trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or
against any fiduciary of the Employee Benefit Plans with respect to the
operation or investment of the assets of such plans (other than routine
benefit claims), nor to the Knowledge of the Company are there any facts which
could form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

  

  

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment
becoming due to any Employee or satisfy any prerequisite (whether exclusive or
non-exclusive) to any payment or benefit to any Employee, except to the extent
that such Employee is also a Pre-Closing Shareholder who is entitled to
receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) increase any
benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefits under any
Employee Benefit Plan. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not be a factor causing payments to be made by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to be non-deductible (in whole or in part) under
Section 280G of the Code.

amounts set forth therein to Acquiror for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing").

  

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Acquiror and,
to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the other parties thereto to provide the Debt
Financing subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the
Debt Commitment Letter, except as enforceability may be limited by General
Enforceability Exceptions. Acquiror has no reason to believe that it or, to
the Knowledge of Acquiror, any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter will
be unable to satisfy any term of the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming no
breach or default by the Company under this Agreement (and cooperation and
assistance by the Company as provided herein) and based upon Acquiror's
Knowledge of facts and events as of the date of this Agreement, Acquiror is
not

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

aware of the existence of any event which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror
under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter. Acquiror has fully
paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. As of the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Debt Commitment Letter, this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement, the aggregate proceeds
from the Debt Financing (including after giving effect to the exercise of any
or all "market flex" provisions related hereto) constitute all of the
financing required to be provided by Acquiror, and are sufficient, if funded,
for the satisfaction of all of Acquiror's obligations under this Agreement in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
payment of all associated costs and expenses, including any refinancing of
Indebtedness of Acquiror. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the
conditions precedent to the funding obligations of the parties thereunder to
make the Debt Financing available to Acquiror on the terms and subject to the
conditions therein.

representatives of Acquiror and its prospective lenders or placement agents
and other financial sources.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall generally keep Acquiror informed
as to all material matters involving the operations and business of the

Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement between Acquiror
and the Company, dated as of May 17, 2010 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
the terms of which shall continue in force until the Closing; provided that
Acquiror and the Company may disclose such information as may be necessary in
connection with seeking necessary consents and approvals as contemplated
hereby and in connection with the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the

the Company and the operations thereat (subject to any limitations contained
in valid, previously executed leases) as Acquiror, in its reasonable

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

discretion, shall deem necessary or prudent (the "Environmental Assessments").
The Environmental Assessments shall be conducted by a qualified environmental

and in compliance with applicable Laws and in a manner that minimizes the
disruption of the operations of the Company. At the request of an officer of
the Company, Acquiror shall promptly furnish the Company copies of any final,

(and not unreasonably withheld) for each entry onto any properties, and

activities of Acquiror or its representatives. Acquiror shall indemnify,
defend and hold the Company and its shareholders, employees and
representatives harmless from and against all Losses or Liabilities related to
or arising from the performance of such Environmental Assessments or any other
activities conducted on the properties by Acquiror or its representatives.
Acquiror shall promptly restore any property to substantially its prior
condition if changed in any material respect due to any physical inspections
or tests performed by or on behalf of Acquiror. The obligations of Acquiror in
the immediately two preceding sentences shall survive the termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

  

  

Section 6.03. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to, and not in
limitation of, Section 6.05 and Section 6.06 and the other terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to satisfy at the earliest
practicable date the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII and to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, including
the execution of additional instruments, the parties to this Agreement shall
take all such necessary action.

  

  

Section 6.04. Consents. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents, waivers,
approvals and notices that are required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to operate the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Closing (including those consents set forth on
Schedule 8.02(b)), and the consents, waivers, approvals and notices referred
to in Section 4.06 hereof (except for such matters covered by Section 6.05,
which are addressed in that Section). All such consents, waivers, approvals
and notices shall be in writing and in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Acquiror, and executed counterparts of such consents, waivers
and approvals shall be delivered to Acquiror promptly after receipt thereof,
and copies of such notices shall be delivered to Acquiror promptly after
making requests therefor.

  

  

Section 6.05. Regulatory Approvals.

  

  

(a) Each of Acquiror and the Company shall use its Best Efforts to (i) make or
cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws with respect to the transactions

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within ten
(10) days after the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other materials received by either
of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division")
or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Acquiror shall be responsible for all filing fees and legal and
other expenses, including those of the Company associated with the required
filings under the HSR Act; provided, however, in the event of a second request
by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority in
respect of such filings, all expenses incurred in connection with responding
to such requests shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses. Each
such party shall use its Best Efforts to furnish to each other in a timely
manner all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of
written communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such transaction and permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority. No party hereto shall independently participate in any formal
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable
Law, the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with the matters described in this Section 6.05, including in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws.

  

  

(b) Each of Acquiror and the Company shall use its Best Efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). In connection
therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in
violation of any Antitrust Law, the Company and Acquiror shall use their Best
Efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, unless, by mutual agreement, Acquiror and the Company
decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of
Acquiror and the Company shall use its Best Efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein, neither Acquiror or the Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required, in connection with the matters covered by this
Section 6.05, (i) to pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees
and expenses and fees of counsel, accountants and other advisors and experts),
(ii) to commence litigation (as opposed to defend litigation), or (iii) to
waive any of the conditions to this Agreement set forth in ARTICLE VII.

  

  

Section 6.06. Acquiror Financing.

  

  

(a) Acquiror shall, between the date hereof and the Closing, use its Best
Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and use its Best Efforts to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, and to satisfy the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein that are within Acquiror's
control, (ii) enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Debt
Financing so that such agreement is in effect as promptly as practicable on
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on other terms acceptable to
Acquiror and its lenders, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Acquiror or Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are
within their control, (iv) consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms
acceptable to Acquiror and its lenders and (v) draw a sufficient amount of the
Debt Financing to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
it is available. If, notwithstanding the use of Best Efforts by Acquiror, any
portion of the Debt Financing expires, is terminated or otherwise becomes
unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason,
Acquiror shall (x) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination
or other unavailability and the reasons therefor and (y) use its Best Efforts
to arrange for alternative financing to replace the Debt Financing
contemplated by such expired, terminated or otherwise unavailable commitments
or agreements in an amount, together with other funding sources, that is
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including using
Best Efforts to enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto;
provided, that Acquiror and Merger Sub shall not be required to arrange or
agree to any such alternative financing on terms which are materially less
favorable to those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (as reasonably
determined by Acquiror). Acquiror shall keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of, and any material developments relating to, Acquiror's
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any replacement thereof).

  

  

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, advisors, accountants, consultants, agents, Affiliates and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to provide, all necessary or

requested by Acquiror or Merger Sub in connection with the Debt Financing (or
any amendments, modifications or replacement thereof) and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) assisting with the
preparation of offering and syndication documents and materials, including
prospectuses, private placement memoranda, confidential information memoranda
and packages, lender and investor presentations, rating agency presentations,
and similar documents and materials, in connection with the Debt Financing
(all such documents and materials, collectively, the "Offering Documents"),

48

practicable with all Required Information and all other information and
disclosures relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including their
businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects) as may be
reasonably requested by Acquiror or Merger Sub (including execution of
customary authorization and management representation letters and certificates
in connection with the Offering Documents and the Required Information), (iii)
assisting in the preparation for and participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, road shows and other marketing presentations, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) obtaining accountant's
comfort letters and consents from the Company's independent auditors, (v)
assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive
financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents, hedging

Acquiror or Merger Sub, (vi) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the
Debt Financing, including taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to
permit the financing sources of the Debt Financing to evaluate the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' real property and current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and
other accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in
connection with the Debt Financing, (vii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the financing sources benefit from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (viii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations and
instruments which may be reasonably requested by Acquiror or Merger Sub in
connection with the Debt Financing and collateral arrangements, including
customary payoff letters, lien releases, instruments of termination or
discharge, legal opinions, surveys, title insurance and landlord consents,
waivers and access agreements and (ix) facilitating the consummation of the
Debt Financing, including cooperating with Acquiror and Merger Sub to satisfy
the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing to the extent within the
control of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by
Acquiror or Merger Sub to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation
immediately upon the Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company's obligations set forth in this Section 6.06(b)
shall also include commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and assist in
obtaining) in a timely manner appraisals, surveys, engineering reports,
environmental and other inspections, title insurance and other documentation
and items relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Acquiror;
provided, that such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Acquiror
shall promptly, upon written request by the Shareholders' Representative,
reimburse the Shareholders' Representative for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

documented attorneys' fees of counsel for the Company and its Subsidiaries)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section
6.06(b).

  

  

(c) The Company agrees that it shall inform Acquiror if, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any information regarding the Company in the Offering Documents
would cause the Offering Documents to be materially misleading; provided,
however, that the Company shall have no affirmative obligation to review the
Offering Documents for such information.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of the Company under Section 6.06(b) shall be deemed satisfied
unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained as a direct result of the
Company's material breach of such obligations. None of the Pre-Closing
Shareholders or any of their respective Representatives shall have any
obligations under Section 6.06(b) following the Closing. All non-public
information provided to prospective lenders and investors shall remain subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement except to the extent (i) disclosure is
necessary and customary in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing or
(ii) any such lender or investor has entered into a confidentiality agreement
with the Company, in which case the terms and conditions of such
confidentiality agreement shall govern in respect of such lender or investor.

  

  

Section 6.07. Public Announcements. The parties shall consult with each other
and shall mutually agree (the agreement of each party not to be unreasonably

release or other public statements with respect to the transactions

make any such public statement prior to such consultation and agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law or by any stock exchange

other parties of the content and timing of any such press release or other
public statement required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
stock exchange regulations.

as soon as practicable after discovery thereof, the Company shall supplement
or amend the Company Disclosure Letter delivered in accordance with ARTICLE IV
in respect of any failure of any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in this Agreement to be true and correct, including as a result of any
event occurring after the date hereof. If the Closing occurs, Acquiror waives
any right or claim it may otherwise have or have had on account of any matter
so disclosed in such supplement or amendment; provided, that such supplements
or amendments shall not be deemed to qualify the representations and
warranties with respect to the closing conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII.

  

  

Section 6.09. No Implied Representations or Warranties. Acquiror hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Company is not making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, except those representations and
warranties of the Company explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter, or any certificate contemplated hereby and delivered by the
Company in connection herewith. Subject to the foregoing, the assets and
business of the Company being acquired by Acquiror at the Closing as a result
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be acquired
by Acquiror on an "as is, where is" basis and in their then present condition,
and Acquiror shall rely solely upon its own examination thereof. In any event,
except as explicitly set forth herein,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

neither the Company nor any of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates
or representatives has made or is making any representation, express or
implied, as to the value of any asset or business of the Company, or the
future prospects of the Company, or any warranty of merchantability,
suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or quality, with respect to
any of the Tangible Personal Property of the Company, or as to the condition
or workmanship thereof, or as to the absence of any defects therein, whether
latent or patent.

  

  

Section 6.10. No Solicitation by the Company; Etc. Neither the Company, any of

adverse to the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 6.18. Indemnification and Insurance.

provided in the Governing Documents of the Company as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than ten (10) years
from the Closing Date; provided, however, that, in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within such ten (10) year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims. Acquiror agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to fully perform all obligations to be performed by Surviving
Corporation under the Governing Documents. Acquiror further agrees that, for
ten (10) years after the Closing, Acquiror or Surviving Corporation shall
maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance policies indemnifying
and holding harmless the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to any
actions or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, providing at least Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) insurance coverage on terms no less advantageous
to the Company Indemnified Parties than the Company's existing policy;
provided that in the event any claim is asserted or made within such ten
(10)-year period, coverage under such insurance shall be continued in respect
thereof until final disposition of such claim. In the event the foregoing
indemnities or insurance policies become unavailable or unenforceable for any
reason (other than by the expiration of the ten (10) year time periods
referenced above), Acquiror agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnified Parties to the same extent
as if such indemnities and insurance were available and in full force and
effect.

  

  

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person (other than a Subsidiary
of Acquiror) and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties, assets or stock to any Person (other than a Subsidiary
of Acquiror), then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation (or their
successors and assigns) shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.18.

(e) by either the Company or Acquiror if the Closing shall not have occurred
by the close of business on December 31, 2010 (the "Initial Termination
Date"); provided, that if on the Initial Termination Date the proceeds of the
Debt Financing are not then available to Acquiror in full pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter (or alternative financing pursuant to Section 6.06(a)), but
all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (without regard to the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(b)) shall have been satisfied or waived or
shall then be capable of being satisfied, then the Initial Termination Date
shall be automatically extended to the close of business on February 28, 2011;
provided, further, that either the Company or Acquiror shall have the option
to extend, from time to time, the Initial Termination Date for additional
periods of time but not beyond June 30, 2011, whether by the Company or
Acquiror, if (i) all of the other conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII shall
have been satisfied or waived or shall then be capable of being satisfied and
the sole reason that the Closing has not occurred is that the condition set
forth in Section 7.01(b) and, if applicable, the conditions set forth in the
proviso of Section 8.01 has not been satisfied, and (ii) either or both of the
Company and Acquiror are still attempting to obtain the expiration or
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or are contesting any suit
or injunction to enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(e) shall not be available to any party whose material breach of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date. As used in this Agreement, the term "Termination
Date" shall mean the Initial Termination Date, unless the Initial Termination
Date has been extended as provided in this Section 9.01(e), in which case, the
term "Termination Date" shall mean the date to which the Initial Termination
Date has been so extended; or

  

  

(f) by Acquiror if there has been an event, change, occurrence, circumstance
or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 9.02. Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to Section 9.01, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Acquiror, Merger Sub
or the Company. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated as
provided herein, no party hereto shall have, from and after such termination,
any liability or further obligation to any other party to this Agreement
resulting from such termination except the obligations of the parties set
forth in Section 6.12, this Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and ARTICLE XI, which
shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that except as otherwise provided in Section 9.03, nothing in this
Section 9.02 shall relieve Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company of any
liability for a willful breach of this Agreement prior to the effective date
of termination.

  

  

Section 9.03. Termination Fee. If (a) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided, that such conditions shall have been capable of being satisfied at
the Closing) have been satisfied, and (b) either (i) the Company or Acquiror
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(e), or (ii) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(c), then Acquiror shall pay
to the Company a termination fee in the amount of Thirty-Five Million Dollars
($35,000,000) (the "Termination Fee") in immediately available funds no later
than three (3) business days after such termination by the Company or
Acquiror. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.03, the receipt of the Termination
Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of, the
Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any proceeding, claim, suit or action against Acquiror or Merger Sub
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination.

may continue to be asserted in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this ARTICLE X.

  

  

Section 10.02. Indemnity.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE X, from and after the
Closing, each of the Pre-Closing Shareholders shall severally, and not
jointly, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Acquiror and its Affiliates (including

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE X, from and after the
Closing, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally
defend and hold harmless the Pre-Closing Shareholders from and against any and

Section 10.03. Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

  

  

(a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the Escrow Termination Date
of a certificate signed by any officer of Acquiror (an "Officer's
Certificate") stating that one or more claims for Losses exist with respect to
the indemnification obligations of the Pre-Closing Shareholders, and
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Losses included
in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, or properly accrued
or arose, and the nature of the inaccurate representation or warranty, or
breach of a covenant or agreement or other claim to which such item is
related, the Escrow Agent shall, when and to the extent permitted by the
provisions of this ARTICLE X and the Escrow Agreement, deliver to Acquiror out
of the Escrow Fund a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to such Losses.

  

  

(b) At the time of delivery of any Officer's Certificate to the Escrow Agent,
Acquiror shall deliver a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate to the
Shareholders' Representative; provided that any Officer's Certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 10.03(a) (and the duplicate copy thereof
delivered pursuant to this Section 10.03(b)) shall be delivered by Acquiror
promptly after Acquiror becomes aware of the Losses which form the basis for
such Officer's Certificate. For a period of thirty (30) days after such
delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or the Escrow Agreement unless the Escrow Agent
shall have received written authorization from the Shareholders'
Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 30-day
period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 10.03(a) and the Escrow Agreement, provided that no
such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholders' Representative shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to
Acquiror prior to the expiration of such 30-day period.

  

  

(c) In case the Shareholders' Representative shall so object to any claim or
claims by Acquiror made in any Officer's Certificate, Acquiror shall have
thirty (30) days to respond in a written statement to the objection of the
Shareholders' Representative. If after such 30-day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders' Representative and Acquiror shall
attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholders'
Representative and Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

such memorandum and shall distribute the amounts from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

  

  

(d) The Escrow Agent shall release and distribute any amounts from the Escrow
Fund for which the Escrow Agent receives a copy of a written order of any
federal or state court that has become final and not subject to appeal and has
been certified by the clerk of such court or other appropriate official
setting forth the amount of the Escrow Fund to be released and distributed to
Acquiror or the Shareholders' Representative.

  

  

Section 10.04. Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims.
If an indemnified party receives written notice of the commencement of any
action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by any third party or the
imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought
under Section 10.02 (a "Third Party Claim"), and the indemnified party intends
to seek indemnity pursuant to this ARTICLE X, the indemnified party shall
promptly provide Acquiror or the Shareholders' Representative, as applicable,
with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and
the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. The indemnifying party (Acquiror or the Shareholders' Representative
on behalf of the Pre-Closing Shareholders, as applicable) shall have thirty
(30) days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give
notice to assume the defense thereof. If notice to the effect set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence is given by the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
indemnified party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice,
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party. If such notice
is not given, the indemnified party shall (upon delivering notice to such
effect to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim. So long as the
indemnifying party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance herewith, (a) the indemnified party may retain separate co-counsel
at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim, (b) the indemnified party shall not file any papers or consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party and
(c) the indemnifying party shall not (i) admit to any wrongdoing or (ii)
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement provides
for equitable relief, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party (such written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The parties shall use Best Efforts to minimize the
amount of any Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties
shall also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access
to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the indemnifying party
assumed the defense, the indemnifying party shall not be obligated to
indemnify the indemnified party hereunder for any settlement entered into or
any judgment that was consented to without the indemnifying party's prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

Section 10.05. Termination of Escrow.

  

  

(a) The Escrow Fund shall terminate on the Escrow Termination Date; provided,
however, that any portion of the Escrow Fund that is subject to any
unsatisfied claim for any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Loss specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent
prior to the Escrow Termination Date shall remain in the Escrow Fund until
such claims have been resolved (the "Escrow Reserve").

  

  

(b) Within three (3) business days after the Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Pre-Closing Shareholders that are not Dissenting
Shareholders the amount in the Escrow Fund (including any interest, dividends
or other earnings thereon), minus the amount of the Escrow Reserve. The
portion of the Escrow Reserve corresponding to a claim for any Loss that was
open at the Escrow Termination Date shall be released to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Pre-Closing Shareholders or to Acquiror, as appropriate,
promptly upon resolution of such claim.

  

  

(c) Promptly following receipt by the Paying Agent of any release by the
Escrow Agent of any portion of the Escrow Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 10.05(b), the Paying Agent shall pay to each Pre-Closing Shareholder
who has made a Satisfactory Tender an amount equal to (i) such Pre-Closing
Shareholder's Pro Rata Share, multiplied by (ii) the amount of such released
Escrow Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 10.06. Limitations of Liability.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this ARTICLE X, Acquiror shall
not have a right to seek indemnification under this ARTICLE X for any Losses:

  

  

(i) arising out of an inaccurate representation or warranty or breached
covenant of which Acquiror (A) had Knowledge as of the Closing Date (for
purposes of this Section 10.06(a)(i), Acquiror shall be deemed to have
Knowledge of (1) the information posted on the DataSite maintained by Merrill
Corporation and (2) any other information disclosed to Acquiror prior to the
Closing Date) or (B) contributed to the condition or circumstance forming the
basis of such Loss;

  

  

(ii) for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages;
provided, however, and for greater certainty, that such limitation shall not
apply to an award to a third party based on a Third Party Claim, provided that
Acquiror uses its Best Efforts to mitigate the amount and nature of any such
award;

  

  

(iii) to the extent such Loss is expressly reserved against on the Balance
Sheet;

  

  

(iv) unless the aggregate of all Losses by Acquiror exceeds, on a cumulative
basis, an amount equal to One-Half Percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price, and
then only to the extent of any such excess;

  

  

(v) for any individual Loss, or group of Losses arising out of the same event
or series of related events, that totals less than Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000), and such Losses shall not be aggregated for purposes of the
immediately preceding clause (iv); or

  

  

(vi) to the extent that the aggregate liability of the Pre-Closing
Shareholders for all Losses by Acquiror exceeds the Escrow Amount, except in
the event of actual fraud perpetrated in writing.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(b) The amount of any Loss shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by
Acquiror under insurance policies with respect to such Loss, minus any
deductibles required to be paid by Acquiror or self-insured retentions for the
related Loss under such insurance policies and the amount of any increases in
premiums under those insurance policies resulting from such Loss. The amount
of any Loss shall be reduced by the net amount of any Tax benefits actually
recognized by Acquiror in the year such Loss was incurred.

  

  

(c) For the purpose of calculating the amount of any Loss under this ARTICLE X
after a breach has occurred (and, for the sake of clarity, not for the purpose
of determining whether a breach has occurred), any and all materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties
shall be disregarded.

  

  

(d) For all Tax purposes, Purchaser and the Company agree to treat any
indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Aggregate
Merger Consideration unless a final determination (which shall include the
execution of an IRS Form 870 AD or successor form, to the extent applicable)
provides otherwise.

  

  

(e) Except in the event of actual fraud perpetrated in writing, Acquiror
acknowledges and agrees that its, and the Surviving Corporation's, sole remedy
against the Pre-Closing Shareholders for any matter arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is set forth in this ARTICLE X and
that, except to the extent Acquiror has asserted a claim for indemnification
prior to the Escrow Termination Date, neither Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have any other remedy against the Pre-Closing Shareholders
for the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or any breach of any
covenant in this Agreement or any other matter arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In no event shall any Pre-Closing Shareholder
have any liability for Claims arising from the conduct of the Surviving
Corporation's business after Closing. Except in the event of actual fraud
perpetrated in writing, the sole recourse of Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall be against the Escrow Fund and claims against the Escrow
Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation for any claims hereunder or otherwise.

  

  

(f) Subject to the indemnification obligations set forth in this ARTICLE X and
except in the event of actual fraud perpetrated in writing, Acquiror agrees
that no Pre-Closing Shareholder shall have any liability or responsibility
whatsoever to any Person, including to Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
for, and Acquiror unconditionally releases the Pre-Closing Shareholders from,
any Liability of, or relating to, the Company of whatever kind or nature,
whether contingent or absolute, whether arising prior to, on or after, and
whether determined or indeterminable on, the Escrow Termination Date, and
whether or not specifically referred to in this Agreement, including
Liabilities: (i) relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) arising out of or due to any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty made by the Company or the breach of any covenant, undertaking or
other agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement; and (iii) relating
to any violation of any present or future law or regulation.

  

  

Section 10.07. Exclusive Remedy. Except in the event of actual fraud
perpetrated in writing, the parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies for any matter based upon,
arising out of or otherwise with respect to the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement are the indemnification
obligations set forth in this ARTICLE X, except with respect to any purchase
price adjustment pursuant to Section 3.05.

  

  

Section 10.08. Shareholders' Representative.

  

  

(a) The Shareholders' Representative, who shall initially be Robert A.
Griffin, is constituted and appointed as agent for and on behalf of the Pre-
Closing Shareholders as of the Effective Time to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Acquiror of funds from the Escrow
Fund in satisfaction of claims by Acquiror, to object to such deliveries, to
make claims on behalf of the Pre-Closing Shareholders, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and make claims and comply with
awards with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, or otherwise as permitted hereunder. The
Shareholders' Representative may be changed by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Pre-Closing Shareholders from time to time upon not less than
ten (10) days' prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of
the Shareholders' Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Pre-Closing Shareholders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Shareholders' Representative shall have the full power and authority to
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to consent to any
amendment hereof or thereof in its capacity as Shareholders' Representative.

  

  

(b) The Shareholders' Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Shareholders' Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith.

  

  

(c) The Shareholders' Representative shall be given reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the Surviving Corporation's officers and employees for purposes of performing
its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, and shall have the right to
reimbursement from the Escrow Fund of his reasonable fees and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and the costs of experts and advisors) incurred in
connection with his duties as the Shareholders' Representative hereunder and
as the Investors' Representative under the Rollover Agreement.

  

  

(d) Any action taken by the Shareholders' Representative pursuant to the
authority granted in this Section 10.08 shall be effective and absolutely
binding as the action of the Pre-Closing Shareholders under this Agreement.
Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every Pre-Closing Shareholder. Acquiror is hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders' Representative.

  

  

Section 10.09. 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

(a) Upon the request of Acquiror by the delivery of written notice to the
Shareholders' Representative within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
all the Pre-Closing

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Shareholders shall join with Acquiror in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and any corresponding or
similar elections under state, local or foreign Tax Law (collectively, the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the Company (which shall
include the assets and liabilities of Craig Protein Division, Inc. and Agro
Griffin Industries de Mexico). For purposes of making the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Pre-Closing Shareholders shall
deliver to Acquiror an executed original IRS Form 8023 (or successor form) and
any other corresponding or similar form required under state, local or foreign
Tax Law. If no Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made, such forms will be
returned to the Shareholders' Representative and the remainder of the
provisions of this Section 10.09 shall not apply.

  

  

(b) Acquiror shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms
and documents required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall
provide the Shareholders' Representative a copy of such filings. In addition
to the Form 8023 and any other corresponding or similar forms required under
state, local or foreign Tax Law, the Pre-Closing Shareholders shall execute
and deliver to Acquiror such additional documents or forms as are reasonably
requested to properly complete the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is required to be
filed.

  

  

(c) Acquiror and the Pre-Closing Shareholders shall file, and shall cause
their Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and reports in connection therewith
in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Laws.

  

  

(d) The Pre-Closing Shareholders shall report on their Tax Returns and shall
be responsible for the payment of any Taxes payable as a result of, any
income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election. Acquiror shall be responsible for the Increased Tax Costs
and the Gross Up (both as defined below) of the Pre-Closing Shareholders. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "Increased Tax Costs" shall mean the excess of
(A) the amount of Taxes payable by the Pre-Closing Shareholders (net of any
Tax benefits received by the Pre-Closing Shareholders) as a result of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement by the Pre-
Closing Shareholders and the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election over
(B) the amount of Taxes that would have been payable by the Pre-Closing
Shareholders as a result of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
the Rollover Agreement hereunder had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been
made (such Taxes, in each case, calculated as provided below). Payments under
this Section 10.09(d) shall be grossed up for the additional Tax liability
(calculated as provided below) incurred by the Pre-Closing Shareholders
resulting from the receipt of payments made pursuant to this Section 10.09(d)
(the "Gross Up"). Acquiror shall be responsible for any state or local
corporate income or franchise taxes imposed on the Company, Craig Protein
Division, Inc., or Agro Griffin Industries de Mexico for that portion of the
gain attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election that is apportioned to
such state or local jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Acquiror
shall be entitled to a payment from the Shareholder\'s Representative on
behalf of the Pre-Closing Shareholders of an amount equal to the Kentucky LLET
tax liability incurred by the Company, Craig Protein Division, Inc., or Agro
Griffin Industries de Mexico as a result of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 338(h)(10) Election. This payment will be made from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Escrow Agreement.
"Increased Tax Costs" shall be calculated (i) for ordinary income tax items,
by using the maximum federal income tax rate for individuals in effect on the
Closing Date, (ii) for capital gain items, by using the maximum federal long-
term capital gains tax rate for individuals in effect on the Closing Date,
(iii) by assuming that all Pre-Closing Shareholders are residents of Kentucky
and pay tax at the highest state and local marginal tax rates, (iv) by taking
into account the deductibility of state income and local income taxes for
federal income tax purposes, and (v) without taking into account any gain or
loss arising from the 338(h)(10) Election attributable to the Rolling Stock,
the Hinds County Property or the Headquarters. "Gross Up" shall be calculated
by (x) dividing Increased Tax Costs by a decimal equal to 1.0 minus the
maximum federal long-term capital gains tax rate for individuals in effect on
the Closing Date (expressed as a decimal) and minus 0.06 for state and local
income taxes and (y) subtracting from the amount determined in (x) the
Increased Tax Costs. For example, if the Closing Date were on or before
December 31, 2010, the parties anticipate that the Gross Up would be equal to:
(Increased Tax Cost/ (1.0-0.15-(0.06 x 0.65))-Increased Tax Costs. No later
than thirty (30) days after the Allocation Statement (as defined in Section
10.09(e)) has been agreed to by the parties (or, as the case may be, the
Accountants have rendered their determination), the Shareholders'
Representative shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Acquiror a schedule
setting forth a calculation of the Increased Tax Costs and the Gross Up (the
"ITC Schedule") together with supporting documentation. Acquiror shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the ITC Schedule to notify the Shareholders'
Representative in writing of any objections. If Acquiror does not object in
writing during such thirty (30) day period, the ITC Schedule shall be final
and binding on all parties. If Acquiror objects in writing during such thirty
(30) day period, Acquiror and the Shareholders' Representative shall cooperate
in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable ITC Schedule, which shall be
binding on all parties. If Acquiror and the Shareholders' Representative are
unable to reach an agreement, any disputed items shall be referred to the
Accountants for resolution, and the determination of the Accountants shall be
final and binding on all parties. The fees and expenses of the Accountants
shall be paid Fifty Percent (50%) by Acquiror and Fifty Percent (50%) by the
Shareholders' Representative. Any fees and expenses of the Accountants payable
by the Shareholders' Representative shall be paid by a release of funds from
the Escrow Account to Acquiror. Within seven (7) days after the ITC Schedule
has been agreed to (or, as the case may be, the Accountants have rendered
their determination), Acquiror shall pay the Increased Tax Costs and the Gross
Up, as set forth on the final ITC Schedule, to the Shareholders'
Representative, and thereafter Acquiror shall have no further obligation to
the Pre-Closing Shareholders pursuant to this Section 10.09(d).

  

  

(e) (i) Within sixty (60) days after Final Working Capital has been
determined, Acquiror shall provide to the Shareholders' Representative a
statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating the Purchase Price and any
other items, including liabilities of the Company, Craig Protein Division,
Inc. and Agro Griffin Industries de Mexico, that are treated as additional
Purchase Price for Tax purposes (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Purchase Price") among the Company, Craig Protein Division, Inc. and Agro
Griffin Industries de Mexico and among the different items of assets of the
Company, Craig Protein Division, Inc. and Agro Griffin Industries de Mexico.
(ii) The Shareholders' Representative shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Allocation Statement to notify Acquiror in writing of any
objections. If the Shareholders' Representative does not object in writing
during

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

   
 

such thirty (30) day period, the Allocation Statement shall be final and
binding on all parties. If the Shareholders' Representative objects in writing
during such thirty (30) day period, the parties shall cooperate in good faith
to reach a mutually agreeable allocation of the Section 338(h)(10) Purchase
Price, which allocation shall be binding on all parties. If the parties are
unable to reach an agreement, any disputed items shall be referred to the
Accountants for resolution, and the determination of the Accountants shall be
final and binding on all parties. The fees and expenses of the Accountants
shall be paid Fifty Percent (50%) by Acquiror and Fifty Percent (50%) by the
Shareholders' Representative. Any fees and expenses of the Accountants payable
by the Shareholders' Representative shall be paid by a release of funds from
the Escrow Fund to Acquiror. (iii) Acquiror and Pre-Closing Shareholders agree
to file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) and reports consistent with
the foregoing. If any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation of the Section
338(h)(10) Purchase Price as reflected on the final Allocation Statement, the
party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party.

  

  

Section 10.10. Tax Covenants.

  

  

(a) (i) The Shareholders' Representative shall be responsible for preparing
the state and federal income Tax Returns of the Company and the Craig Protein
Division, Inc. for the taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
Each such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the prior
Tax Returns of the Company and the Craig Protein Division, Inc., provided each
such Tax Return shall not reflect any adjustment pursuant to Code Section
481(a) or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law by reason of a
change in accounting method. The Shareholders' Representative shall provide a
copy of any Tax Returns it prepares at least thirty (30) days before they are
due, taking into consideration extensions of time to file, for the Acquiror's
review and approval. The Shareholders' Representative and Acquiror shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns
prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the Shareholders'
Representative and Acquiror are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to
such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing, such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 10.10(c), which resolution shall
be binding on the parties. (ii) Acquiror shall prepare all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than those referred to in Section
10.10(a)(i), for any taxable period that begins on or before the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date. (iii) Acquiror shall not, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, prepare an amended income Tax Return for the
Company or for the Craig Protein Division, Inc. for a taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date without first obtaining the consent of the
Shareholders' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(b) After the Closing, Acquiror shall promptly notify the Shareholders'
Representative in writing upon commencement of any Tax audit, suit, action or
proceeding (each a "Tax Contest") concerning any Tax that the Pre-Closing
Shareholders have indemnified Acquiror and its Affiliates against under
Section 10.02. The Shareholders' Representative shall have control over such
Tax Contests, which shall include, subject to the immediately following
sentence, the right to settle, compromise and/or concede any such Tax Contest
and the right to employ counsel of their choice at their expense; provided,
however, that the Shareholders'

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Representative shall keep Acquiror apprised of all material developments
relating to any such Tax Contest and shall conduct the defense of such Tax
Contest diligently and in good faith. The Shareholders' Representative shall
not settle, compromise and/or concede a Tax Contest if such settlement,
compromise and/or concession would have an adverse impact on Acquiror for any
taxable period without the consent of Acquiror, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(c) Any dispute as to any matter covered in this Section 10.10 shall be
resolved by the Accountants. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be
borne equally by the Shareholders' Representative, on the one hand, and the
Acquiror on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, (i) such Tax Return shall
be filed in the manner which the party responsible for such Tax Return deems
correct and (ii) upon resolution of such dispute by the Accountants, the
parties agree to file amended Tax Returns reflecting such resolution.

Miscellaneous Provisions

  

  

Section 11.01. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned, in whole
or in part, by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; provided, however, that Acquiror and Merger Sub may assign
this Agreement and any or all rights, interests or obligations hereunder to
any Affiliate of Acquiror, and as collateral to any Person from which it has
borrowed money. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Acquiror or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall also apply to any
such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. Subject to the foregoing
sentences, this Agreement (and, unless otherwise expressly provided therein,
of any document, including the Company Documents, delivered pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted
assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 11.01 shall be null and
void.

  

  

Section 11.02. Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall, except for the rights of the Pre-Closing Shareholders and the
Shareholders' Representative, and except for the rights of the Acquiror's
lenders and other debt financing sources under Section 11.10, Section 11.11
and Section 11.13, inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.03. Expenses. Except as set forth in this Section 11.03, Section
6.05, Section 6.06 or as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
parties hereto shall be responsible for the payment of its own respective
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiations leading up to
and the performance of its respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement
and the agreements referenced herein, including the fees and expenses of any
attorneys, accountants, brokers or other advisors employed or retained by or
on behalf of such party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall pay all

71  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 11.04. Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby agrees that irreparable injury to Acquiror would occur
in the event that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not
performed by the Company in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, for which damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy for Acquiror. It is accordingly agreed that, without prejudice
to Acquiror's rights pursuant to Section 9.01, Acquiror shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Company and that Acquiror shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof, without bond or other security being required, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, if all of the conditions specified in
Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall have been satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied, then Acquiror shall be entitled to an injunction requiring the
Company to perform its obligations necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Closing. The Company
acknowledges that Acquiror may seek a specific performance remedy in lieu of
terminating this Agreement even if Acquiror otherwise is entitled to terminate
this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Acquiror hereby agrees that irreparable injury to the Company would occur
in the event that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not
performed by Acquiror in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached, for which damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy for the Company or its shareholders. It is accordingly agreed that,
without prejudice to the Company's rights pursuant to Section 9.01, the
Company and/or the Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Acquiror
and that the Company and/or the Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled at law or in equity. Acquiror acknowledges that the
Company may seek a specific performance remedy in lieu of terminating this
Agreement even if the Company otherwise is entitled to terminate this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be
entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Acquiror to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, provided, that such conditions shall have been capable of being
satisfied as of the date of termination of this Agreement) and the proceeds of
the Debt Financing are then available in full pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter (or such other definitive agreements in respect of the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter or alternative financing pursuant to
Section 6.06(a)).

73  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(a) The provisions of the table of contents, descriptive headings of the
several articles and sections of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letters and the other schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All

words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice
versa.

  

  

(c) The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and "hereunder" refer

words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

  

  

(d) The word "including" or any variation thereof means (unless the context of
its usage requires otherwise) "including, but not limited to," and shall not
be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it.

  

  

(e) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.07. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 11.08. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered, in person or by exchange via electronic
mail (in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)) or facsimile with the other
parties hereto.

including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the Company Documents, the
Acquiror Documents, any written amendments to the foregoing satisfying the
requirements of Section 11.12 hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement and all
other agreements referenced herein, including the Schedules and Exhibits
thereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

   
 

matter hereof and thereof and supersede any previous agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such matters. All Exhibits
and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any
capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined
therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement. There are no
restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, agreements or
undertakings of either party hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Documents, the Acquiror Documents,
the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein other
than those set forth herein or therein or in any other document required to be
executed and delivered hereunder or thereunder.

  

  

Section 11.10. Governing Law and Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and any matter based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise), the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and any
agreements entered into in connection herewith or any actions of or omissions
of any party in any way connected with, related to or giving rise to any of
the foregoing matters (collectively, the "Covered Matters") shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations, and
judicial and administrative decisions (in each case, both procedural and
substantive) of the State of New York (except with respect to those provisions
set forth herein in respect of the Merger that are required to be governed by
Kentucky Law), without reference to its conflicts of law principles, that if
applied might require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE COVERED
MATTERS.

  

  

Section 11.11. Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Any action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of,
this Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in any federal or
state court located within the State of Ohio, and each of the parties consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue
laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the preceding
sentence may be served on any party anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against Acquiror's lenders or other financing sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the

modified, superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants,

writing, no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
