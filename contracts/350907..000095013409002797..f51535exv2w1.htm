ARTICLE 2 
 The Mergers 

   

 Section 2.01. _The Mergers_. (a) _The Mergers_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in the Merger, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the Intermediate 

   ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation. If, and only if, the Continuity Percentage equals or
exceeds the Reorganization Threshold, immediately following the Effective
Time, the Intermediate Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and
into Merger Subsidiary Two in the Second Merger, whereupon the separate
existence of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation shall cease, and Merger
Subsidiary Two shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Continuity Percentage is less than the Reorganization
Threshold, the Parties shall not, and shall have no obligation to, consummate
the Second Merger pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _The Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") shall take place on a day that is a Business Day (i) at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific time), no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than (A) those conditions that are waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the Party or Parties for whose benefit such conditions exist and (B) any such conditions that, by their terms, are not capable of being satisfied until the Closing) or (ii) at such other place, time and/or date as the Parties may otherwise agree. The date upon which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." 

  

 (c) _The Merger_. At the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and properly executed in accordance with, Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as is agreed upon by the Parties and specified as the effective time in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Intermediate Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _The Second Merger_. If, and only if, the Continuity Percentage equals or exceeds the Reorganization Threshold, at the Closing, immediately following the consummation of the Merger, the Parties shall cause the Second Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Second Merger Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and properly executed in accordance with, Delaware Law. The Second Merger shall become effective at such time as the Second Merger Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as is agreed upon by the Parties and specified as the effective time in the Second Merger Certificate of Merger (the "Second Merger Effective Time"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Second Merger Effective Time precede the Effective Time. At the Second Merger Effective Time, the effect of the Second Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Second Merger Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation and Merger Subsidiary Two shall vest in the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Intermediate
Surviving Corporation and Merger Subsidiary Two shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Merger Subsidiary Two or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary: 

  

 (a) _Merger Subsidiary Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) share of common stock of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Company Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each share of Company Stock (each, a "Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares that will be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.02(d) and any shares of Company Stock ("Dissenting Shares") which are held by Company Stockholders exercising appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law ("Dissenting Stockholders")) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive (i) $14.30 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) 0.6054 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Stock, subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.02(c) (the "Stock Consideration" and together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). 

  

 (c) _Adjustments to Stock Consideration._ Notwithstanding the foregoing: 

   

 (i) If the Average Parent Stock Price is less than or equal to $18.38 (the "Walk-Away Price"), the Company shall have the right to give written notice to Parent (a "Walk-Away Notice"), of the Companys election to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(d)(iii) hereof. Any Walk-Away Notice shall be delivered to Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the second (2nd) Business Day following the Measurement End Date. If the Company delivers a timely Walk-Away Notice, Parent shall have the right to give written notice to the Company (the "Top-Up Notice"), of Parents election to increase (A) the per share Stock Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (i) the product of (x) the Stock Consideration, (y) $26.25 and (z) seventy percent (70%) divided by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price and (B) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio to (i) the product of (x) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio, (y) $26.25 and (z) seventy percent (70%) divided by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. Any Top-Up Notice shall be delivered to the Company no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the second (2nd) Business Day following delivery to Parent of the Walk-Away Notice. In the event that Parent delivers a Top-Up Notice in response to a duly delivered Walk-Away Notice in accordance with this Section 2.02(c)(i), (1) the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(iii) and (2) for all purposes under this Agreement, the Stock Consideration and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio shall mean the Stock Consideration and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.02(c)(i). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) If the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $34.13, Parent shall have the right to give written notice to the Company (a "Reset Notice"), of Parents election to decrease (A) the per share Stock Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (i) the product of (x) the Stock Consideration, (y) $26.25 and (z) one hundred thirty percent (130%) divided by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price and (B) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio to (i) the product of (x) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio, (y) $26.25 and (z) one hundred thirty percent (130%) divided by (ii) the Average Parent Stock Price. Any Reset Notice shall be delivered to the Company no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the second (2nd) Business Day following the Measurement End Date. In the event that Parent delivers a Reset Notice in accordance with this Section 2.02(c)(ii), for all purposes under this Agreement, the Stock Consideration and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio shall mean the Stock Consideration and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.02(c)(ii). 

  

 (d) _Treasury Shares_. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Merger Subsidiary Two immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "Treasury Shares") shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (e) _Treatment of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Stock will be issued and, in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Merger, each holder of Shares (and, to the extent applicable, CDIs) who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Stock pursuant to the Merger will be paid an amount in cash, without interest, in lieu thereof equal to such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales by the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Stock that such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of Parent Stock issuable to the former holders of Shares pursuant to the Merger including fractional shares, over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Stock to be distributed to former holders of Shares (and, to the extent applicable, CDIs) (such excess being collectively called the "Excess Parent Stock"). The Exchange Agent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date upon which the Certificate (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that would otherwise result in the issuance of such fractional shares of Parent Stock has been received by the Exchange Agent), sell the Excess Parent Stock on NASDAQ at the then prevailing prices on NASDAQ and such sales shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent and costs associated with calculating and distributing the respective cash amounts payable to the applicable former holders of Shares, incurred in connection with such sales of Excess Parent Stock. Until the proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Shares (and, to the extent applicable, CDIs) to whom fractional shares of Parent Stock otherwise would have been issued in the Merger, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former holders of Shares (and, to the 

   ##### 

  

    

extent applicable, CDIs) in respect of any fractional shares of Parent Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall distribute such amounts to such former holders. 

  

 (f) _Changes in Capitalization_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company Stock Awards to purchase shares of Company Stock, the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Company Stock Award Amount and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be adjusted appropriately to account for such change. 

  

 (g) _Limitation on Issuance of Parent Stock_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company delivers a Walk-Away Notice and Parent elects to deliver a Top-Up Notice in response thereto, and, as a result of Parents delivery of such Top-Up Notice, after giving effect to the increase in the Stock Consideration and the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio that would result therefrom in accordance with Section 2.02(c)(i), the issuance of shares of Parent Stock and Parent Incentive Options in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would require the approval of Parents stockholders under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350, then (i) the per share Stock Consideration shall be reduced to a number of shares of Parent Stock such that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock issued or to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be equal to the maximum number of shares of Parent Stock that may be issued without requiring the approval of Parents stockholders under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350, and, for all purposes under this Agreement, the Stock Consideration shall mean the Stock Consideration as so adjusted and (ii) the per share Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of shares by which the per share Stock Consideration has been reduced pursuant to the preceding Section 2.02(g)(i) and (B) the Average Parent Stock Price. 

  

 Section 2.03. _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. (a) _Unvested Incentive Stock Options_. The terms of outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Stock granted or issued under incentive option agreements or similar arrangements with directors, employees or consultants of the Company or under the HeartWare International, Inc. Incentive Option Terms: Non-Executive Directors or the HeartWare International, Inc. 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (each, a "Company Incentive Option") shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company Incentive Option that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including each Company Incentive Option issued prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 6.01(c)(i)(B), shall cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Company Stock and shall instead be converted into, and deemed to constitute, an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Incentive Option, a number of shares of Parent Stock (each, a "Parent Incentive Option") equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Stock represented by such unvested Company Incentive Option and (b) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock and such Parent Incentive Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to (x) the per 

   ##### 

  

 

share exercise price specified in such Company Incentive Option divided by
(y) the Company Stock Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each
Parent Incentive Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent necessary to
avoid treating the assumption of such Company Incentive Options as a grant of
a new stock option under Section 409A of the Code, the exercise price of
Parent Incentive Options shall be increased. For purposes of this Section
2.03(a), any exercise price for a Parent Incentive Option that is measured in
Australian dollars shall be deemed to be converted to U.S. dollars for all
purposes hereunder at an exchange rate of 1.5265 Australian dollars for each
U.S. dollar. 

   

 (b) _Vested Incentive Stock Options and Employee Stock Options_. The terms of each outstanding vested Company Incentive Option and each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock issued under the HeartWare International, Inc. Employee Stock Option Plan (each, a "Company ESOP" and, together with the Company Incentive Options, each, a "Company Option") shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each such Company Option, whether or not exercisable or vested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Cancelled Company Option") shall be cancelled and will convert into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the Company Stock Award Amount over the applicable exercise price per share of Company Stock of such Cancelled Company Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock issued under the HeartWare International, Inc. Employee Stock Option Plan) had such holder exercised such Cancelled Company Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of Shares or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) _Certificates Only Represent Right to Receive Merger Consideration_. Each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the Shares represented thereby as contemplated by Section 2.06. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. 

  

 (c) _Stock Transfer Books; Share Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of either Surviving Corporation of any Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. 

  

 (d) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in Permitted Investments as directed by Parent on a daily basis from time to time. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand. In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent under this Article 2, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations. 

  

 (e) _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.05 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without interest. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporations, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. 

  

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or either Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, and upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of a duly completed letter of transmittal in accordance with this Section 2.05, following the Effective Time the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, without interest. 

  

 (g) _Dividends on Parent Stock_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.02(e), shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Book-Entry Shares not transferred until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.05. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name such shares of Parent Stock have been registered, (i) promptly following such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is 

   ##### 

  

    

entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such shares of Parent
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such shares of Parent Stock. 

  

 (h) _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Merger Subsidiary Two, the Surviving Corporations and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Awards or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Merger Subsidiary Two, such Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Tax law and, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 2.06. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair value" of its Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the Delaware Law, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this Section 2.06) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to be paid the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares, in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder (a) withdraws (in accordance with Delaware Law) or (b) effectively loses the right to dissent and receive the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of "fair value" of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent notice of any demand by a Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the "fair value" of its Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall have the right to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Delaware Law) or otherwise lost its right to dissent and receive the "fair value" of its Dissenting Shares, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2, without interest.

   ##### 

  

    

Recommendation Change even if such changes were to be given effect and (3)(x)
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 6.04 and (y) in the event that the Board of Directors of the

necessary to consummate the Mergers and to fully carry out the purposes of

 (c) Each Party shall (a) subject to Section 6.06(d) below, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional information and documentary material received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division and to all inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority in connection with Regulatory Approvals and antitrust matters, (b) not extend any waiting period or agree to refile under the HSR Act (except with the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (c) not enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division agreeing not to consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

consummate any merger or other acquisition of a business or any similar
transaction (other than a license of Intellectual Property entered into in

 Section 6.09. _Obligations with Respect to Continuing Employees and Benefit Matters_. (a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with Applicable Law and Parents applicable benefit plans, the employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporations (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those received by similarly situated employees of Parent; _provided_ that neither Parent nor either Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements. In addition, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall enter into Incentive Agreements, in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ with such modifications or revisions thereto as may be agreed upon by Parent, for the benefit of certain employees of the Company designated on Schedule 6.09(a) hereto, pursuant to which such employees will receive cash payments in the amounts, at the times and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Incentive Agreements.

Any amounts pursuant to such retention bonuses and the Incentive Agreements that are forfeited shall be returned to the Company. To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confirmatory assignments of Intellectual Property from current and former employees and independent contractors and consultants, in each case in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Parent.

   ##### 

  

    

Parent (and will consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending
any notices or other communication materials to its employees.

 (c) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law and Parents applicable benefit plans, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporations to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent with respect to any plans or programs in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time (i) for purposes of eligibility for vacation, (ii) for purposes of eligibility and participation under any health or welfare plan (other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan), (iii) for purposes of eligibility for any vesting of any matching contributions under a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code and (iv) for the purpose of determining the amount of any severance payable under any severance plan of general application, except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporations to recognize any vacation time of Continuing Employees that has accrued and has not been used as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, beginning on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Continuing Employees will be subject to the maximum vacation accruals applicable to Parent employees generally, such that any amounts of accrued vacation time in excess of applicable maximums will be forfeited on and after such date.

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.09 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Section 6.09, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans, programs or arrangements maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees or any other employees of Parent prior to or following the Effective Time, or of either Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time, or impose an obligation on any of the Company, Parent or, on or after the Effective Time, either Surviving Corporation, to establish, amend, terminate or otherwise take any action with respect to any compensation or benefits plan, program or arrangement or (ii) confer upon or give to any Person (including any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Company, Parent, or, on or after the Effective Time, either Surviving Corporation), other than the Parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.09).

 (b) For a period of seven (7) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering those persons who are currently covered on the date of this Agreement by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy or who becomes covered prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those in the current directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company and in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.10(b), Parent shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year with respect to its current directors and officers liability insurance policy, which amount Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. Alternatively, in full satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 6.10(b), Parent may purchase a seven (7) year prepaid (or "tail") policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those in the current directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company and in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the cost of any such policy need not exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance. 

  

 (c) The rights of each current or former director or officer of the Company (each an "Indemnified Person") under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

   ##### 

  

   

(y) twenty (20) Business Days after Parent receives written notice of such

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01
(other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other Parties in accordance with Section 9.01. 

   

 Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.02, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Merger Subsidiary Two or the Company (or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this Section 8.02, Sections 6.05(b) and 8.03, Article 9 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that no such termination (or any provision of this Agreement) shall relieve or release any Party from liability for any damages for a knowing, intentional and material breach of any provision of this Agreement. In no event shall any Party be liable for punitive damages. 

  

 Section 8.03. _Termination Fee_.

 (iii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii)(A) other than in connection with any Superior Proposal, (A) the Company shall pay to Parent (or 

   ##### 

  

   

as directed by Parent), by wire transfer of same day funds, $5,000,000 (the
"Adverse Recommendation Change Fee") as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such termination)
and (B) in the event that within twelve (12) months of the termination of
this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount equal to
(x) the Company Termination Fee minus (y) the Adverse Recommendation Change
Fee, such payment to be made upon the earlier to occur of the execution of a
definitive agreement relating to, or consummation of, such Acquisition
Proposal. 

   

 (iv) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or Section 8.01(c)(i), then, in the event that, (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination any Third Party shall have publicly made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention to make a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, which bona fide Acquisition Proposal was not retracted or rescinded prior to such termination and (B) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made upon the earlier to occur of the execution of a definitive agreement relating to, or consummation of, such Acquisition Proposal.

 (b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Merger Subsidiary Two would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Adverse Recommendation Change Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment Parent commences a legal action which results in a judgment against the Company for all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee or the Adverse Recommendation Change Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such action.

 Section 9.02. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties of the Parties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (or the Schedules of Exhibits attached hereto) shall survive the Effective Time. None of the covenants or agreements of the Parties in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, other than (a) the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Article 9, in Article 2 and in Sections 6.10 and 6.11 and (b) those other covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply, or that are to be performed in whole or in part, after the Effective Time, in each case which shall survive the consummation of the Mergers until fully performed. 

  

 Section 9.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment that, by Applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without such stockholder approval. 

  

 (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Merger Subsidiary Two, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties under this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the other Parties or conditions to the obligations of the waiving Parties contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no extension or waiver that, by Applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without such stockholder approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder. 

  

 Section 9.04. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring, or required to incur, such Expenses, whether or not the Mergers are consummated. 

  

 Section 9.05. _Mutual Drafting; Headings_. Each Party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the Parties. The captions, headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.06. _Assignment; Binding Effect; Parties in Interests_. (a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Merger Subsidiary Two may assign all or any of their rights (but not their obligations) hereunder to one or more of their wholly-owned Affiliates upon written notice to the Company, and Parent, the Intermediate Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation may assign all or any of their rights or obligations hereunder after the Second Merger Effective Time to any Person so long as any such assignment would not reasonably be expected to cause the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that the provisions of Section 6.10 shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Person benefiting therefrom who are intended third-party beneficiaries thereof. 

  

 Section 9.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any laws other than the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 9.08. _Jurisdiction_. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder and agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, based upon or related to this Agreement in any other court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with Section 9.01, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the 

   ##### 

  

    

rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be properly served or delivered
if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.01. 

  

 Section 9.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AN THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MERGERS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.09. 

  

 Section 9.10. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and that the Parties may enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, with all such matters to take place exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and any such injunction shall be in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled, at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 9.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the other instruments delivered pursuant hereto), the Loan Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 Section 9.12. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction such term or other provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon a determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, 

   ##### 

  

    

each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and which shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the Parties and delivered (by facsimile, electronic mail or otherwise) to the
other Parties. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other Parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no
effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).
