equal to such holder&#146;s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales by the
Exchange Agent on behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Stock that
such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. As soon as practicable following the
completion of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i)&nbsp;the number of whole
shares of Parent Stock issuable to the former holders of Shares pursuant to the Merger including
fractional shares, over (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Stock to be distributed
to former holders of Shares (and, to the extent applicable, CDIs) (such excess being collectively
called the &#147;<B>Excess Parent Stock</B>&#148;). The Exchange Agent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after the date upon
which the Certificate (or affidavit(s) of loss in lieu thereof) that would otherwise result in the
issuance of such fractional shares of Parent Stock has been received by the Exchange Agent), sell
the Excess Parent Stock on NASDAQ at the then prevailing prices on NASDAQ and such sales shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer Taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent and costs associated with calculating and distributing the respective cash amounts payable to
the applicable former holders of Shares, incurred in connection with such sales of Excess Parent
