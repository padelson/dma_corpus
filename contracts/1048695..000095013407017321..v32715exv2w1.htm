Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the Incentive Plan and applicable stock option agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such options will be exerciseable for
that number of shares of common stock, no par value per share, of Parent (the &#147;<B>Parent Common
Shares</B>&#148;) determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Unvested In
the Money Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise
price per Parent Common Share equal to the exercise price per share of such Unvested In the Money
Option, as applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (each, an &#147;<B>Assumed Option</B>&#148;). If the foregoing calculation
results in an Assumed Option being exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common Share, then the
number of Parent Common Shares subject to such option will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares. The Assumed Options will have the same vesting schedule as the Unvested In the
Money Options (giving effect to any acceleration as a result of the Transactions) and continuous
employment with Company will be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of
the number of Parent Common Shares subject to exercise under the optionee&#146;s Assumed Option after
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<B>Exchange Ratio</B>&#148; will mean the number
determined by dividing the PCSE Amount by the average of the closing prices of a Parent Common
Share as publicly reported for the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time for
each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time. The adjustment
