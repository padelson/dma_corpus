ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER; DELIVERY OF CONSIDERATION 

   

 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action (except as provided in Section 4.4 and in this Section 2.1) on the part of Acquisition Sub, Parent, Company, or the holder of any shares of Company capital stock ("Company Shares"): 

  

 2.1.1 _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of Acquisition Sub common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of Surviving Corporation common stock ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock"), with the stock certificate of Acquisition Sub evidencing ownership of such share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. 

   

 2.1.2 _Cancellation of Company Shares_. Each Company Share held by Company as treasury stock and each Company Share owned directly or indirectly by Company or by any subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.2) of Company will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered or deliverable in exchange for such Company Shares. Company will obtain a written consent to such cancellation from any subsidiary, whether or not wholly owned, that owns Company Shares. 

   

 2.1.3 _Conversion of Company Securities_. Subject to the limitations on payments and the timing of payments as set forth in Section 2.2 and Article VIII, each Company Share and Vested In the Money Option (as defined below) validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal Shares, as defined in Section 2.1.4, and those Company Shares referred to in Section 2.1.2), will, without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted into, or with respect to Vested In the Money Options, cancelled in exchange for, their respective conversion payment ("Conversion Payment"), which will be calculated as follows: 

   

 (a) Each share of Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive the greater of (i) $1.00 per share as provided for in Article Fourth, Section B(2)(a) of Companys certificate of incorporation (the "Series A Liquidation Preference Payment"), or (ii) an amount equal to the PCSE Amount (as defined below) multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible, pursuant to Article Fourth, Section B(4) of Companys certificate of incorporation. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive the greater of (i) $1.165 per share as provided for in Article Fourth, Section B(2)(a) of Companys certificate of incorporation (the "Series B Liquidation Preference Payment"), or (ii) an amount equal to the PCSE Amount multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares into which each share of Series B Preferred Stock is then convertible, pursuant to Article Fourth, Section B(4) of Companys certificate of incorporation. 

  

 (c) Each share of Company Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive the greater of (i) $1.295 per share as provided for in Article Fourth, Section B(2)(a) of Companys certificate of incorporation (the "Series C Liquidation Preference Payment"), or (ii) an amount equal to the PCSE Amount multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares into which each share of Series C Preferred Stock is then convertible, pursuant to Article Fourth, Section B(4) of Companys certificate of incorporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Each share of Company Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive the greater of (i) $1.489 per share as provided for in Article Fourth, Section B(2)(a) of Companys certificate of incorporation (the "Series D Liquidation Preference Payment"), or (ii) an amount equal to the PCSE Amount multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares into which each share of Series D Preferred Stock is then convertible, pursuant to Article Fourth, Section B(4) of Companys certificate of incorporation. 

  

 (e) Each share of Company common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Company Common Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the PCSE Amount. 

  

 (f) Each Vested In the Money Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) that number of Company Common Shares for which such Vested In the Money Option is then exercisable, multiplied by (ii) the PCSE Amount minus the exercise price per share of such Vested In the Money Option (the "Option Payment"), which Option Payment will be reduced by any applicable required payroll, income tax, or other withholding taxes. 

  

 (g) To the extent that the Conversion Payment for any share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock is equal to the PCSE Amount multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares into which such share of Preferred Stock is then convertible (as opposed to the applicable liquidation preference payment), such payment will be referred to herein as the "As Converted Preferred Payment". 

  

 (h) At the Effective Time, all Company Shares will be cancelled and will cease to exist and each certificate (a "Certificate") previously representing any Company Shares will represent only the right to receive the applicable Conversion Payment as provided by this Section 2.1.3. The amount that the holders of Company Shares are entitled to receive at Closing under this Section 2.1.3 will be reduced by their pro rata share of the Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 2.2), which will be deposited with the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement to satisfy indemnification claims under Article VIII. 

  

 (i) The numbers (other than the Base Amount) and placeholders used in the attached Schedule 2.1.3 are for purposes of illustration only and will be adjusted and set forth in a final Schedule 2.1.3, which shall be determined in accordance with the following procedures, adjustments and definitions as of Closing and approved in writing by Parent and Company before Closing: 

  

 "Adjusted Base Amount to PCSEs" will mean the Gross Distributable Amount less the aggregate Series A Liquidation Preference Payments, Series B Liquidation Preference Payments, Series C Liquidation Preference Payments, and Series D Liquidation Preference Payments, if any, to be made to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, respectively. 

  

 "Base Amount" means $210,000,000.00. 

  

 "Gross Distributable Amount" means the Base Amount, plus (i) the Option Consideration and less (ii) the Transactional Expenses. 

  

 "In the Money Options" means each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with a per share exercise price less than the PCSE Amount as finally determined. 

   ##### 

  

  

 "Option Consideration" means the aggregate exercise price of all Vested In the Money Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 "PCSEs" or "Participating Common Stock Equivalents" means the sum of (i) all Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) all Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of Vested In the Money Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) all Company Common Shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock for which the Conversion Payment will be the As Converted Preferred Payment (as opposed to the applicable liquidation preference payment thereon). 

  

 "PCSE Amount" means the Adjusted Base Amount to PCSEs divided by the PCSEs. 

  

 "Transaction Expenses" means (i) the legal, accounting, financial and other professional services fees and expenses, including the fees and expenses of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, incurred by Company in connection with the Transactions (as defined in Section 3.1.2(b)), and (ii) any other bonuses or similar payments that become payable as a direct result of the consummation of the Transactions, including (to the extent paid, whether at or after Closing) the $1.5 million authorized by Companys board of directors for payment to certain Company employees in connection with the Transactions.

 "Vested In the Money Options" means each In the Money Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is vested, which will include any In the Money Option that becomes vested in connection with the Transactions. 

 

Schedule 2.1.3 will be adjusted and approved in writing by Parent and Company
prior to Closing and, as so adjusted and approved, will be the final and
determinative calculation of the respective Conversion Payments and the
amounts used in the determination thereof pursuant to this Section 2.1.3. 

   

 2.1.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Company Shares validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not consented to the Merger in writing and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal rights for such Company Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the "Appraisal Shares") will not be converted into a right to receive the Conversion Payment unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights. If such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights, such Company Shares will be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1.3, without any interest therefor. Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal rights, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 2.2 _Escrow_. At Closing, cash in the amount of $21,000,000.00 (the "Escrow Amount") to be received by holders of Company Shares in accordance with Section 2.1.3 (pro rata based upon the total consideration to be received by such holder at Closing) will not be distributed to or made available for holders of Company Shares in accordance with Section 2.1.3 but rather will be deposited by Parent with, and held by Wells Fargo Bank, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), in an escrow fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2 (the "Escrow Agreement") to secure claims by Parent or Surviving Corporation for indemnification in accordance with 

   ##### 

  

    

Article VIII. The release of the Escrow Amount will occur on the first
anniversary of the Closing, and will be subject to the terms hereof and of the
Escrow Agreement; provided that in the event of any conflict between this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the terms of the Escrow Agreement will
control. 

  

 2.3 _Delivery of Consideration_. 

  

 2.3.1 _Exchange Agent_. No later than the Closing Date, Parent will deposit with Wells Fargo Bank (the "Exchange Agent") an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Conversion Payments, other than the Option Payments, less the Escrow Amount. The Exchange Agent will invest the deposited sum in its discretion (provided that Parent will be responsible for replacing any losses of principal to such deposited sum resulting from such investments) and all interest thereon will be paid to Parent for its sole benefit. 

   

 2.3.2 _Exchange Procedures_. At the Effective Time Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to pay by check or wire transfer of same day funds the applicable Conversion Payments, under Section 2.1.3 and subject to Section 2.2 hereof, to each record holder of Company Shares as of the Effective Time, other than to those holders of Appraisal Shares not entitled to payment, as promptly as practicable following (i) the submission of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent and a duly executed letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") by such holder of record, which will specify that risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of such documents to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in the form and have such provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify, and (ii) the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Conversion Payment by such holder of record (which Certificates will then be canceled). If any Certificate has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the payment of any reasonable fees, and the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such document, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed document, the applicable Conversion Payments to which the holder is entitled under this Article II. 

   

 2.3.3 _Payments by Parent_. Within a reasonable period of time after Closing, not to exceed 30 days, Parent will pay by wire transfer of funds to a Company payroll account, the Option Payments under Section 2.1.3(f) and will cause Company to pay such amounts to holders of Vested In the Money Options, which payments will be reduced by any applicable payroll, income tax, or other withholding taxes. 

   

 2.3.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The applicable Conversion Payment delivered in exchange for Company Shares in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. After the Effective Time, no further transfers will be made on the stock transfer books of Company of Company Shares issued prior to the Effective Time. When the Merger becomes effective, all Company Shares issued prior to such time (other than Appraisal Shares) will cease to exist, and each Certificate previously representing any such shares will represent only the right to receive the applicable Conversion Payment as described in Section 2.1.3 subject to the terms of this Agreement. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by law. 

   

 2.3.5 _Return to Parent_. The Exchange Agent will redeliver or repay to Parent any cash made available to the Exchange Agent and not exchanged for Certificates within 12 months after the   ##### 

  

  

  

Effective Time. After such time any holder of Certificates who has not yet
delivered or surrendered such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, subject to
applicable law, will look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of
the applicable Conversion Payment. Despite any provision of this Agreement,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither Parent,
the Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders Representative,
nor any other party will be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any
cash delivered to a public official according to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar law. 

   

 2.3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable Conversion Payment otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person (as defined in Section 10.2) who was a holder of Company Shares or Vested In the Money Options immediately prior to the Effective Time, such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax law. Any such withheld amounts will be timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1.4). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificates or Vested In the Money Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. 

   

 2.4 _Outstanding Options_. 

  

 2.4.1 _Assumed Options_. At the Effective Time, the Incentive Plan (as defined below) and each outstanding Unvested In the Money Option under the Incentive Plan, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, will be assumed by Parent. Each such Unvested In the Money Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Incentive Plan and applicable stock option agreement, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such options will be exerciseable for that number of shares of common stock, no par value per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Shares") determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Unvested In the Money Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise price per Parent Common Share equal to the exercise price per share of such Unvested In the Money Option, as applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (each, an "Assumed Option"). If the foregoing calculation results in an Assumed Option being exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common Share, then the number of Parent Common Shares subject to such option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. The Assumed Options will have the same vesting schedule as the Unvested In the Money Options (giving effect to any acceleration as a result of the Transactions) and continuous employment with Company will be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of the number of Parent Common Shares subject to exercise under the optionees Assumed Option after the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, "Exchange Ratio" will mean the number determined by dividing the PCSE Amount by the average of the closing prices of a Parent Common Share as publicly reported for the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time for each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time. The adjustment set forth in this Section 2.4.1 will comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and, if applicable, Code Section 424(a). 

  

 2.4.2 _Cancelled Options_. Any Company Options that are not Unvested In the Money Options will terminate as of Closing without any further action by the holder thereof in accordance with any stock option agreements or plans or this Agreement, as applicable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.4.3 _Registration_. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to file a Form S-8 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") covering the Assumed Options within 10 days after the Effective Time or include such options in a presently effective registration statement. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for so long as such Assumed Options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), Parent will administer Assumed Options in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, but will have no responsibility for such compliance by Company or its predecessors.

No Plan is covered by Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412\. No "prohibited transaction," as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975, has occurred with respect to any Plan. Each Plan has been maintained and administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations, including ERISA and the Code,

action, or other litigation has been brought against or with respect to any
Plan. All contributions, reserves, or premium payments to each Plan required

benefits accrued prior to the date of termination or ordinary administrative
expenses) and satisfaction of applicable notice. There have been no unwritten
amendments to any Plan or interpretations (whether or not written) by
Company relating to coverage under any Plan. No tax under Code Section 4980B

of any Plan that is a group health plan, as defined in Code Section
5000(b)(1). 

  

 (b) Neither Company nor any entity that is or was considered one employer with Company under ERISA Section 4001(a)(14) or Code Sections 414(b), (c), or (m) has ever maintained, had an obligation to contribute to, contributed to, or had any liability with respect to any current or former employee benefit plan that is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA (including any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of ERISA Section 4001(a)(3). No Plan is a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA Section 3(40). 

  

 (c) All Plans that are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States are in material compliance with and have been operated in a manner materially consistent with their terms and all applicable laws (including relevant tax laws), and the requirements of any trust deed under which they were established. Section 3.1.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies all of Companys employee benefit plans that are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States. With respect to each Plan, no event has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, that would subject Company, directly or indirectly, to any material liability arising under any applicable laws, including relevant tax laws (including any liability to or under any such Plan or any indemnity agreement to which Company is a party), excluding liability for benefit claims and funding obligations. With respect to each such Plan, there are no funded benefit obligations for which the contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted, on the Financial Statements to the extent required to be so accounted for or footnoted. 

  

 (d) No Plan is subject to any ongoing or scheduled audit or other administrative proceeding of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other federal, state, or local governmental entity or, to the Companys knowledge, is under investigation by such an entity with respect to a Plan.

with respect to each such lease or sublease of personal property (in case of

this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. No consent is required
from any party under any Company Lease in connection with the completion of
the Transactions, and Company has not received notice that a party to any
Company Lease intends to refuse to renew any Company Lease or to exercise any
option or other right thereunder, except where the failure to receive such

Company has received no written notification that it is or may be liable for natural resource damages, the investigation or cleanup of Hazardous Materials, or for the response costs incurred by others in conducting such investigation or cleanup, which, in either case would not result, or reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Company, no fact or circumstance currently exists that is reasonably likely to involve Company in any legal proceedings alleging violations of Environmental Law or to result in the imposition of liability upon the Company under Environmental Law. 

  

 (e) To the knowledge of Company, Company has not, either by agreement or by operation of law, assumed or undertaken any liability (including future or contingent liabilities) of another Person under any Environmental Law, including any obligation for investigation, cleanup, corrective action, or natural resource damages with respect to Hazardous Materials.

If Company is contacted by any third party expressing an interest in discussing a Restricted Transaction, Company will promptly, but in no event later than 24 hours following Companys knowledge of such contact, notify Parent in writing of such contact and the identity of the party so contacting Company and any information conveyed to Company by such third party in connection with such contact or relating to such Restricted Transaction, and will promptly, but in no event later than 24 hours, advise Parent of any material modification or proposed modification thereto; provided, however, before Company Stockholder Approval, in each case, if and to the extent that (a) Companys board of directors determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted, after consultation with Companys outside legal counsel and Companys financial advisor, that such Restricted Transaction is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined hereafter), and (b) Companys board of directors determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted, after consultation with Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to participate in such discussions, disclose such nonpublic information, provide such access to its properties, books, or records, enter into any agreement relating to such Restricted Transaction, or make or authorize any public statement relating to any Restricted Transaction or any offer or proposal relating to a Restricted Transaction would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Companys board of directors under applicable law, then Company may participate in discussions regarding such Restricted Transaction, provide non-public information with respect to Company, afford access to the properties, books, or records of Company, enter into any agreement relating to such Restricted Transaction, or make or authorize any public statement relating to any Restricted Transaction or any offer or proposal relating to a Restricted Transaction, as applicable. 

   

 (b) Neither the board of directors of Company nor any committee thereof will directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation,   ##### 

  

  

  

or declaration of advisability by the board of directors of Company or any
such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger, or the Transactions, or
(B) recommend, adopt, or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt, or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Change of Recommendation") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow Company or
any subsidiary of Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (A)
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon,
terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Despite the foregoing, until
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, and subject to Companys compliance
at all times with the other provisions of this Section 4.1.2, the board of
directors of Company may make a Change of Recommendation if such board of
directors determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that it is required to do so in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Company
under applicable law. Company will provide Parent with forty eight
(48) hours prior notice of any meeting of Companys board of directors at
which the board of directors is reasonably expected to take action with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Change of Recommendation. 

   

 (c) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal, or offer from any Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to, lead to a Restricted Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the equity securities of Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or substantially all of the assets of Company, on terms which Companys board of directors reasonably believes (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to its stockholders than the Merger and the Transactions. 

   

 4.2 _Breach of Representations and Warranties; Notification; Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof, Company will (i) confer with Parent and its respective Representatives, at such times as they may request, about operational and integration matters to the extent permitted by law, and (ii) in the event of, and promptly after becoming aware of, the occurrence of or the pending or threatened occurrence of any event that would cause or constitute a breach of any of the representations and warranties in Section 3.1, give detailed written notice thereof to Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly remedy any such material breach or inaccuracy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company will promptly notify Parent of (A) any discussions or actions (of any type, preliminary or otherwise) relating to bankruptcy of Company, (B) any complaints, investigations, or hearings (or communications indicating that any complaints, investigations, or hearings may be contemplated) of any Governmental Entity (for which Company has received written or oral notice), (C) any loss of or damage to any material property owned by Company, (D) any change in material existing relationships with outside third parties (for which Company has received written or oral notice), (E) the institution or threat of any litigation that could affect Company, (F) the failure of Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it in accordance with this Agreement, or (G) any other matter that could result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Subject to appropriate restrictions on access to information that Company determines in good faith to be proprietary, or competitively sensitive and any applicable law that restricts Company from disclosing information related to Companys employees or customers, Company will,   ##### 

  

  

  

subject to applicable law, afford Parent and its respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to (i) Companys properties, books, contracts, commitments,
communications (including e-mail), and records, and (ii) all other
information concerning the business, properties, and personnel of Company, as
Parent may reasonably request that is necessary to complete the Transactions
and prepare for an orderly transition of operations after the Effective Time.
Company agrees to provide to Parent and its Representatives copies of monthly
internal financial statements within 30 days of completion of such month
(which monthly statements will be subject to audit adjustment, including
audit adjustments for FASB Statement No. 123R, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes", FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" and EITF Issue No.
96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services").
No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation in accordance with
this Section 4.2 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent
to consummate the Merger. Any access to Companys properties will be subject
to Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will
not include the right to perform any "invasive" testing. Company will permit
Parents Representatives to meet with the officers of Company responsible for
the financial statements and internal controls of Company and
its subsidiaries to discuss such matters as Parent may deem reasonably
necessary or appropriate to satisfy its obligations under Section 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations relating
thereto. 

   

 4.3 _Tax Returns_. Prior to the Closing Date, Company will properly and timely file or cause to be filed all Returns with respect to Company and any of its subsidiaries that are due prior to the Closing Date and will pay (or cause any applicable subsidiaries to pay) all taxes required to be paid for the period. All such Returns will be prepared consistent with past practice to the extent consistent with applicable law. Company will (i) notify Parent promptly if Company receives written notice of any tax audit, the assessment of any tax, the assertion of any tax lien, or any request, notice, or demand for taxes by any taxing authority, and (ii) provide Parent a description of any such matter in reasonable detail (including a copy of any written materials received from the taxing authority). Company will not (v) amend any Return previously filed, (w) incur any obligation to make any payment of, or in respect of, any material amount of taxes, except in the ordinary course of business, (x) make or revoke any material tax election that may affect Company, (y) agree to extend or waive the statutory period of limitations for the assessment or collection of any material amount of taxes, or (z) enter into any agreement or settlement with respect to any tax without the approval of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 4.4 _Stockholder Approval; Notice to Holders of Company Shares_. Company will obtain irrevocable consents in the form set forth on Exhibit 4.4 hereto approving the Merger from holders of not less than eighty-nine percent (89%) of the Company Shares that are outstanding on the record date for the determination of those shares entitled to vote for or against the Merger ("Record Date Holders") and will provide Parent with a certificate signed by Companys secretary or another officer as to the delivery of such consents to Company, and that such consents have been filed in the minutes of the proceedings of Companys stockholders. On the earlier of five business days after receiving such consents from eighty-nine percent (89%) of the Record Date Holders and August 13, 2007, Company will provide notice to all Record Date Holders that have not approved the Merger, which notice will comply with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL. 

  

 4.5 Intellectual Property Filings Schedule. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Within five business days after the date of this Agreement, Company shall provide Parent with a list accurately identifying and describing each filing, payment, and action that is necessary on or prior to the date that is 120 days after the date of this Agreement in order to maintain each of Companys patent applications, mask works, registered trademarks and copyright registrations in full force and effect. 

  

ARTICLE V 
 COVENANTS OF PARENT 

   

 During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent agrees (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or with Companys prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld) that: 

  

 5.1 _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. In the event of, and promptly after becoming aware of, the occurrence of or the pending or threatened occurrence of any event that would cause or constitute a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2, Parent will give detailed notice thereof to Company and will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy such breach or inaccuracy. 

  

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 In addition to the foregoing, Parent and Company each agree to take the following actions after the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 6.1 _Non-Disclosure Agreement_. Company and Parent agree that the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among Company and Parent dated June 21, 2006 ("Non-Disclosure Agreement") will continue in full force and effect and will be applicable to all proprietary or confidential information exchanged in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. 

  

 6.2 _Legal Conditions to the Merger; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, and Company (a) will take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it with respect to the Merger and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon the other, (b) will take, and will cause its respective subsidiaries to take, all commercially reasonable actions to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties in obtaining) any Government Consent or any consent of any third party required to be obtained or made by Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and (c) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Transactions and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled the conditions to Closing under this Agreement. 

  

 6.3 _HSR Act Filings_. 

  

 6.3.1 _Filings and Cooperation_. Each of Parent and Company will take all reasonable steps to: (i) promptly, but in any event no later than five business days after the date of this Agreement, make or cause to be made the filings required of such party or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and Transactions (and request early termination therein); (ii) promptly, but in any event no later than five business days after the date of this Agreement, make or cause to be made any other filings with all foreign Governmental Entities in any jurisdiction in which the parties believe it is necessary or advisable; (iii) comply in a timely manner with any request under any Antitrust Laws (as defined in Section 6.3.2) for additional information, documents, or other material   ##### 

  

  

  

received by such party or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries from the
Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice or other Governmental
Entity in respect of such filings, the Merger, or the Transactions; and (iv)
subject to Section 6.3.2, cooperate with the other party in connection with
any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity under any Antitrust
Laws with respect to any such filing, the Merger, or the Transactions. With
regard to any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding
such filings, each party will inform the other party: (i) prior to delivering
any material communication to a Governmental Entity, (ii) promptly after
receiving any material communication from a Governmental Entity, and (iii)
prior to entering into any proposed understanding, undertaking, or agreement
with any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings, the Merger, or the
Transactions. Neither party will participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and participate; provided however that nothing herein will preclude Parent
from participating in discussions with a Governmental Entity without
participation by Company where the discussions are initiated by the
Governmental Entity, or where the subject matter in the reasonable judgment
of Parent cannot be effectively discussed in the presence of Company. 

   

 6.3.2 _Objections_. Each of Parent and Company will take all reasonable steps to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, and any other federal, state, or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict, or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, and, if by mutual agreement Parent and Company decide that litigation is in their best interests, each of Parent and Company will cooperate to vigorously contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger. Each of Parent and Company will take such reasonable action as may be required to cause the expiration or termination of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger and the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. Despite anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3.2 or in Section 6.3.1, (a) neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to divest any of their respective businesses, product lines, or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the business of Parent, either on a stand-alone basis or as combined with the business of the Surviving Corporation after the Closing, (b) neither Company nor its subsidiaries will be required to divest any of their respective businesses, product lines, or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, provided that this clause (b) will not be read to apply to actions acceptable to Parent which are required to be taken after the Closing, and (c) without the prior written consent of Parent, neither Company nor its subsidiaries shall divest or agree to divest any business, product line, or asset, or take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 6.4 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such expense. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.5 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities, and franchises of Company or Acquisition Sub, the proper officers and directors of each corporation that is a party to this Agreement will take all such action. 

  

 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the Transactions will be a joint press release to be mutually agreed upon between Parent and Company. Following the initial press release and prior to Closing, neither Parent nor Company will make any public announcement concerning this Agreement and the Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Nothing in this Agreement will prevent Parent or Company at any time from furnishing any information to any Governmental Entity or from issuing any release, each as required by law, in which circumstance Parent or Company, as applicable, will make commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party in advance to the extent practicable and in any event will notify the other party as soon as practicable. Company will not make any communication to customers without first consulting with and receiving the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 6.7 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Company will cooperate with Parent with regard to the recruitment and hiring of Companys current employees by Parent or continuing employment with Company. Company will present offers of continued employment to such employees of Company designated by Parent. Such offers will be in a form acceptable to Parent and will be presented in a manner and at times acceptable to Parent. Except as expressly agreed to in writing by Acquisition Sub or Parent, no specific terms and conditions of employment, including terms and conditions pertaining to length of employment, are guaranteed; provided that Parent will provide or cause to be provided, to each person who after Closing remains an employee of Company or becomes an employee of Parent, employee benefit programs that are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing. For purposes of clarification, nothing in this Agreement will limit Parents right to change its employee benefit programs. Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent with its recruitment efforts and to satisfy the requirements of Section 7.2.6 prior to Closing. 

   

 (b) Company will cooperate with Parent to develop appropriate communications to Company employees regarding the Transactions and a transition plan in contemplation of Closing, including delivering other notices to employees as requested by Parent. 

   

 (c) At Parents request and immediately prior to the Effective Time (but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time), Company will terminate or cause to be terminated any or all of the Plans set forth in Section 3.1.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are intended to be qualified within the meaning of Code Section 401(a), with such termination to be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such termination will be contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Additionally, at Parents request, and prior to the Effective Time, Company will terminate or cause to be terminated or amend or cause to be amended any or all other employee benefit plans, policies, and arrangements set forth in Section 3.1.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in such manner as Parent may reasonably direct, with any such termination or amendment to be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.8 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation from liabilities and indemnification of the present or former directors or officers than are currently provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals for a period of six years after the Closing Date or unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable law. 

   

 (b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have, from and after the Effective Time and for a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer and director of the Company and its subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any subsidiary, or of another entity if such service was at the request of or for the benefit of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, is permitted to do so under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any such proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of the proceeding from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the same extent such Persons have the right to advancement of expenses from the Company as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), and Parent shall cause Company and the Surviving Corporation to provide such advancement of expenses. 

   

 (c) This Section 6.8 will survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding Section 10.4, is intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, any Indemnified Party (whether or not parties to this Agreement). If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. 

   

 6.9 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Returns and Payments_. Company shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate taxing authority (or cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Returns relating to Company and its subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date. Returns of Company and its subsidiaries not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to Company and its subsidiaries (except to the extent that counsel for Company renders a legal opinion that there is no reasonable basis in law therefor). With respect to any such Return required to be filed by Company after the Closing that relates to any taxable periods ended on or prior to the Closing Date and the portion of taxes of Company attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period beginning as of the first   ##### 

  

  

  

day of such Straddle Period and ending as of the end of the Closing Date (a
"Pre-Closing Period"), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide the Stockholders Representative, at least twenty (20) business days
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of
such Return, with a draft of such completed Return, together with all
appropriate supporting information and schedules, for the review and approval
of the Stockholders Representative (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld). 

   

 (b) _Refunds_. After the Closing, any tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to Company or any subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period shall be the property of the holders of Company Shares and if received by or credited to the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary will be paid over promptly to the Stockholders Representative to distribute to the holders of Company Shares. At the request of the Stockholders Representative in writing prior to the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date, and provided that the holders of Company Shares agree to bear all of Companys out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such claim, Company shall file any claim for refund for taxes for a Pre-Closing Period. 

   

 (c) _Contests_. 

   

 (i) After the Closing and continuing through the period during which holders of Company Shares are required to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VIII, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders Representative in writing of (A) the commencement of any audit, investigation or administrative or judicial proceeding relating to any tax of Company, any subsidiary or any holder of Company Shares for any Pre-Closing Period and (B) any notice of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit, investigation or administrative or judicial proceeding relating to any tax for any Pre-Closing Period of Company, any subsidiary or any holder of Company Shares; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice will not affect Parents right to indemnification except to the extent, if any, that such failure materially prejudices the holders of Company Shares ability to contest the tax liability in question. 

  

 (ii) In the case of an audit, investigation or administrative or judicial proceeding that relates to any tax of Company or any of its subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period, the Stockholders Representative shall have the right at its expense to control the conduct, defense and settlement of any such audit, investigation or proceeding; provided, however, that the Stockholders Representative shall not settle any such audit, investigation or proceeding in a manner that would materially affect the taxes of Company or its subsidiaries in any period after the Closing, without the consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, further, however, that the Stockholders Representatives rights contained in this Section 6.9(c)(ii) shall apply only to tax matters with respect to which holders of Company Shares are required to indemnify Parent and Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VIII. 

  

 (iii) Except as provided otherwise in this Section 6.9, following the Closing, Parent will have the sole right to conduct any tax audit or other tax contest relating to Company. 

  

 (d) _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. After the Closing, the holders of Company Shares and Parent shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and Parent shall cause Company and its subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and information) in (A) filing any Return, (B) determining a liability for taxes or a right to a refund of taxes or (C) participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of taxes, in each case with respect to Pre-Closing Periods. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and   ##### 

  

  

  

documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities.
The holders of Company Shares and Parent shall make themselves (and their
respective employees, including the employees of Company and its
subsidiaries) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section
6.9(d). Any information obtained under this Section 6.9(d) shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding. 

   

 (e) _Miscellaneous_. From and after the date of this Agreement, Company and its subsidiaries shall not (and, after the Closing, Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries not to), without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (i) make, or cause or permit to be made, any amendment to any Return that would affect Company or any of its subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period for which the holders of Company Shares are required to indemnify Parent and Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VIII or (ii) take or fail to take any action if the taking (or failing to take, as the case may be) of such action would reasonably be expected to cause the initiation of any audit, investigation or administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to the liability of Company or any of its subsidiaries for taxes in any Pre-Closing Period for which the holders of Company Shares are required to indemnify Parent and Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VIII.

Any payment to Parent in accordance with this Article VIII will be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the consideration for the Company Shares.

Any payment to the holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Article VIII will be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the consideration for the Company Shares. 

   

 8.2 _Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Despite anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, whenever a party to this Agreement that may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII ("Indemnitee") receives a written notice that a claim or demand has been asserted or threatened by a third party ("Third Party Claim") for which the Indemnitee may seek indemnification hereunder (other than claims or demands covered by Section 6.9), the Indemnitee will notify the party from which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification ("Indemnitor") of such claim or demand and of the related facts within the Indemnitees knowledge within a reasonable time after receiving such written notice; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the Indemnitor shall relieve the   ##### 

  

  

  

Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor
is materially prejudiced thereby. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 8.2(c), the Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing. If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as aforesaid, then: 

   

 (i) except as set forth in Section 8.2(c), the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee for any attorneys fees incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim following the Indemnitors election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, unless (A) the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnitee or other Indemnitees that are not available to the Indemnitor; or (B) the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that, with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may have different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests; 

  

 (ii) the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor all personnel, books, records and other documents of the Surviving Corporation and materials that are under the direct or indirect control of the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitees agents and that the Indemnitor considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third Party Claim; 

  

 (iii) the Indemnitee shall otherwise cooperate as reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in the defense of such Third Party Claim; 

  

 (iv) the Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim; and 

  

 (v) the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or compromise any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Third Party Claim) or consent to the entry of any judgment (A) which does not, to the extent that the Indemnitee or any of its affiliates may have any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release of the Indemnitee and its affiliates from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) which includes any statement as to or an admission of fact, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the Indemnitee or any of its affiliates or (C) in any manner that involves any injunctive relief against the Indemnitee or any of its affiliates or may materially and adversely affect the Indemnitee or any of its affiliates. 

  

 (c) If (i) the Indemnitor (A) elects not to assume the defense of or fails to confirm its obligation to indemnify for any such Third Party Claim, (B) fails to commence defending the Third Party Claim within ten days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim, or (C) fails to defend diligently the action or proceeding within ten days after receiving notice of such failure from the Indemnitee; or (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to a claim for infringement of intellectual property rights or that could give rise to damages in excess of $5 million, then the Indemnitee will have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitor shall be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee against any attorneys fees incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim, or admit any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or   ##### 

  

  

  

delayed. In the event the Indemnitee conducts and controls a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitor will have the same obligations pursuant to Sections
8.2(b)(ii)-(iv) as the Indemnitee would have in a Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnitor. 

   

 (d) The Stockholders Representative will act on behalf of the holders of Company Shares with respect to all matters hereunder, including with respect to the provision or receipt of any and all notices under this Section 8.2. 

   

 8.3 _Binding Effect_. The indemnification provisions in this Article VIII are an integral part of this Agreement and Merger in the absence of which Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. 

  

 8.4 _Time Limit_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 8.4(b), the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement will survive Closing and will continue until the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date ("Termination Date"), at which time all representations and warranties and the associated rights of indemnification will expire, except to the extent that a claim for breach thereof has been asserted in writing prior to such expiration (in which event the representation or warranty and the associated rights of indemnification shall survive with respect to such claim until such claim has been resolved). 

   

 (b) Despite Section 8.4(a), (i) no time limit will apply for indemnification arising from fraud, willful breach, or intentional misrepresentation by Company, the holders of Company Shares, Parent or Acquisition Sub; and (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 3.1.2 (Capital Structure), Section 3.1.3 (Authority), Section 3.2.2 (Authority), and Section 3.1.18 (Taxes), together with the associated rights of indemnification, will survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the sixth anniversary of the Closing.

 8.5 _Limitations_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.5(a), despite any other provision in this Article VIII, with respect to indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(i) Parent will be entitled to indemnification thereunder only: (i) if the aggregate Parent Indemnifiable Amounts exceed $1,000,000 (the "Parent Threshold Amount"), in which event Parent will be entitled to indemnification, but only to the extent that the aggregate Parent Indemnifiable Amounts exceed the Parent Threshold Amount; and (ii) to the extent that the aggregate Parent Indemnifiable Amounts do not exceed the Escrow Amount. The limitations of this Section 8.5(a) do not apply to, and any calculation of the Parent Threshold Amount as it relates to other Parent Indemnifiable Amounts will not include, Parent Indemnifiable Amounts arising out of (i) fraud, willful breach, or intentional misrepresentation by Company or the holders of Company Shares; or (ii) any breaches of representations and warranties in Section 3.1.2 (Capital Structure), Section 3.1.3 (Authority), and Section 3.1.18 (Taxes); and (iii) Sections 8.1(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

aggregate Stockholder Indemnifiable Amounts do not exceed $21,000,000.00. The

the Stockholder Threshold Amount as it relates to other Stockholder
Indemnifiable Amounts will not include, Stockholder Indemnifiable Amounts
arising out of (i) fraud, willful breach, or intentional misrepresentation by
Parent or Acquisition Sub; (ii) any breaches of representations and

 (a) With the exception of claims based upon fraud, willful breach, or intentional misrepresentation, and claims under Section 8.1(iii) and (iv), from and after the Effective Time, resort to indemnification under this Article VIII will be the exclusive right and remedy of Parent and Surviving Corporation for Parent Indemnifiable Amounts or other damages under this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement will affect Parents or Surviving Corporations rights to equitable remedies to the extent available). 

   

 (b) With the exception of claims based upon fraud, willful breach, or intentional misrepresentation, from and after the Effective Time, resort to indemnification under this Article VIII will be the exclusive right and remedy of the holders of Company Shares for Stockholder Indemnifiable Amounts or other damages under this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this Section 8.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement will affect the rights of holders of Company Shares to equitable remedies to the extent available).

If Company fails to promptly pay Parent any fee due under this Section 9.3, Company will pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing
of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee at the prime rate of interest

For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, trust, estate, organization, or other entity. The words "include," "includes," and "including" when used in this Agreement will be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

The "knowledge of" or other derivations of "know" in this Agreement with respect to a party will mean the knowledge of the executive officers of such party, after the exercise of reasonable inquiry and investigation by such executive officers. In addition to the preceding sentence and not by way of limitation, the "knowledge of" or other derivations of "know" in this Agreement with respect to Company will include the actual knowledge of Chin-Cheng Wu. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. As used in this Agreement, the term "business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions in Seattle, Washington are permitted or obligated by law to be closed for regular banking business. The respective parties hereto and their attorneys have negotiated this Agreement and the language hereof will not be construed for or against either party, as drafter. A reference to a section, schedule, or an exhibit will mean a section in, or schedule or exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth. 

  

 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed (i) in one or more partially or fully executed counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and will bind the signatory, but all of which together will constitute the same instrument, and (ii) by facsimile. The execution and delivery of a Signature Page  Agreement and Plan of Merger, in the form annexed to this Agreement, by any party hereto who will have been furnished the final form of this Agreement will constitute the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such party. 

  

 10.4 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement, the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and the documents referred to in this Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder; and (iii) will not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided. 

  

 10.5 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent, employee, or legal representative of any other party. No party will have the power to control the activities and operations of any other and their status is, and at all times, will continue to be, that of independent contractors with respect to each other. No party will have any power or authority to bind or commit any other. No party will hold itself out as having any authority or relationship in contravention of this Section 10.5. 

  

 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation, and effect, by the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

provided that after the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of
Company, no such amendment will be made except as allowed under applicable
law.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each will be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. 

  

 10.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner. 

  

 10.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court sitting in New Castle County. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New Castle County for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

  

 10.13 _Stockholders  Representative_. 

   

 (a) By virtue of the Company Stockholder Approval, and without any further act of any holder of Company Shares, the holders of Company Shares will be deemed to have appointed Charles River Ventures, LLC (previously defined as the Stockholders Representative) as agent and attorney-in-fact for each holder of Company Shares (except such stockholders, if any, holding Appraisal Shares) for all matters relating to this Agreement, including to give and receive notices and  

  ##### 

  

    

communications; to bind the holders of Company Shares to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; to authorize delivery of cash from the Escrow Amount in
satisfaction of claims by Parent or Surviving Corporation; to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims; and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. 

   

 (b) The Stockholders Representative may be changed by the holders of Company Shares from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Parent, provided that holders of a majority interest of the Escrow Amount agree to such removal of Charles River Ventures, LLC and any successors thereto and to the identity of the substituted agent. A Stockholders Representative may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days written notice to the holders of interest in the Escrow Account, except that no such resignation will become effective until the appointment of a successor Stockholders Representative. Upon resignation of a Stockholders Representative or a successor Stockholders Representative thereto, the holders of a majority interest of the Escrow Amount will agree on a successor Stockholders Representative thereto within 30 days after receiving such notice. If holders of a majority interest of the Escrow Amount fail to agree upon a successor Stockholders Representative within such time, the resigning Stockholders Representative will have the right to appoint a successor Stockholders Representative, or if a Stockholders Representative is not designated within 45 days after receipt of the initial notice, Parent will designate a successor Stockholders Representative. Any successor Stockholders Representative will execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and, without further acts, will be vested with all the rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor Stockholders Representative as if originally named as Stockholders Representative and thereafter the resigning Stockholders Representative will be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. No bond will be required of any Stockholders Representative, and no Stockholders Representative will receive compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders Representative will constitute notice to or from each of the holders of interest of the Escrow Amount for all matters relating to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Stockholders Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholders Representative while acting in good faith. Holders of Company Shares on whose behalf the Escrow Amount is contributed will severally indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold the Stockholders Representative harmless against all loss, liability, or expense incurred without bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of such Stockholders Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of such Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders Representative will be entitled to the advance and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Stockholders Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholders Representative, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (d) A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Stockholders Representative relating to this Agreement will constitute a decision of the holders of Company Shares and will be final, binding, and conclusive upon each such holder. Parent, and all other persons entitled to indemnification under the Escrow Agreement or any other document or agreement entered into in connection herewith or therewith (the "Indemnified Persons"), may rely upon any such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of the holders of Company Shares. Parent and all other Indemnified Persons are hereby relieved from any liability to any  

  ##### 

  

    

Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent, or instruction of the Stockholders Representative.
