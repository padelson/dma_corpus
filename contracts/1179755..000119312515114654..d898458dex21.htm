ARTICLE II

_EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; PAYMENT OF
CONSIDERATION_

Section 2.01 _Effect of Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub and the
Company_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger,
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
holder of any common shares, par value 1/6 cent per share, of the Company ("
_Company Shares_ ") or any shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub ("
_Merger Sub Shares_ "):

 

(a) _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub
Share shall be converted into and become one (1) duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Company (the " _Surviving Company Shares_ ").

 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares; Treatment of
Shares Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All Company Shares that are owned by
the Company as treasury shares and any Company Shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
automatically and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Each Company Share owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and shall instead convert into one (1)
Surviving Company Share.

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to Section 2.01(b), Section
2.02(d) and Section 2.05, each Company Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 0.472
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable ordinary shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (such
shares, " _Parent Shares_ ", and such share consideration, the "
_Merger Share Consideration_ ") and any cash paid in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares in accordance with Section 2.02(d) (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). Subject to Section 2.05, as of the Effective Time, all such
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled, retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
previously evidencing any Company Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or
uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (each, a " _Book-
Entry_

 



3   _Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (i)
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to be
paid in consideration therefor, in accordance with Section 2.02(b), (ii) the
right to the Special Dividend (to the extent such Person held such Company
Share as of the Special Dividend Record Date and the Special Dividend has not
been paid prior to the Effective Time) and (iii) the right to receive other
dividends and distributions in accordance with this Article II, in each case
without interest.

 

(d) _Company Preferred Shares_. In connection with the Merger, the date on
which the Companys 8.875% non-cumulative preferred shares Series A (the "
_Company Preferred Shares_ ") become redeemable pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of
the Certificate of Designation governing the Company Preferred Shares (the "
_Certificate of Designation_ ") shall be accelerated to the Effective Time.
As a result of this requirement, the Company has determined to exercise its
option to redeem all of the Company Preferred Shares in accordance with
Section 7(a)(2) of the Certificate of Designation as described more fully in
Section 5.22 of this Agreement.

Section 2.02 _Exchange Fund_. (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and
delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II and, in connection therewith, shall at or prior to the Closing Date
enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent (i) a number of certificated
Parent Shares or Parent Shares in book-entry form sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Share Consideration and (ii) an amount in cash sufficient to
pay, to the extent then determinable, cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.02(d) (such shares and cash, and cash referred to
in the immediately following sentence, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). From time to time as necessary and determinable, Parent
shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent
additional cash sufficient to pay the cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.02(d) and any dividends and other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(e). Pending its disbursement in
accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated
the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5 billion. Any and all interest earned on the funds in the Exchange Fund
shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent. No investment losses resulting
from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish
the rights of any former holder of Company Shares to receive cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(d) and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or 2.02(e) pertaining
thereto as provided herein.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Certificates_. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of a

 



4  Certificate or Book-Entry Share a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving
Company may specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval (to be
sought prior to the Effective Time)), together with instructions thereto,
setting forth, _inter alia_ , the procedures by which holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares may receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to this Article II.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, holders of Book-
Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate but may, if
required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration
such holder is entitled to pursuant to this Article II. Upon the completion of
such applicable procedures by a holder and the surrender of such holders
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such
holder (A) a certificate or book-entry representing that number of whole
Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Share (taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder)) that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
and (B) if applicable, (x) cash in an amount (subject to Section 2.02(i))
equal to the cash in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) plus (y) any dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(c) or 2.02(e), and such surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment (1) shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder or (2)
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Company that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
satisfaction of the applicable procedures contemplated by this Section 2.02
and subject to Section 2.05, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Article II.

 

(c) _Share Register; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid and payments (if any) made pursuant to Section
2.02(e) in respect of each Company Share upon surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, _subject_ , _however_ , to (i) Section 2.05 and (ii) the Surviving
Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with
a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared by the
Company on Company Shares not in violation of the terms of this Agreement or
prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time (which may include, for avoidance of doubt, the Special Dividend). At
the Effective Time, the share register of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share
register of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Company Shares formerly represented by Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares 

 



5  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(g),
if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a Parent Share may be issued in connection with the
Merger and no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and no such
fractional share will entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, any holder of Company Shares or Share Units who would otherwise have
been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share shall be paid cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled under this Article
II multiplied by (ii) the Average Parent Share Price.

 

(e) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to any Parent Shares that the holder thereof has
the right to receive upon the surrender thereof until the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to any applicable
state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
the holder thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, in
addition to all other amounts to which such holder is entitled under this
Article II, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Shares that such holder is entitled to
pursuant to this Article II with a record date after the Effective Time and
paid with respect to Parent Shares prior to such surrender and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Shares that such holder is entitled to pursuant to
this Article II.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to be paid in
respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article II.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which has not been 

 



6  disbursed to former holders of Company Shares, and thereafter such former
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company
for, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall remain liable to the extent
required by applicable Law for, payment of their claims of the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to their
former Company Shares that such former holders have the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, immediately
prior to such time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required or permitted to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of other applicable Tax or other Laws. To
the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to or on behalf of the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.03 _Company Equity Awards_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, the Compensation and
Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly-
authorized committee thereof administering the Company Share Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions to adjust the terms of all
Share Units to provide that, immediately following the Effective Time, each
Share Unit that is subject solely to time-based vesting requirements and not
performance-based vesting requirements (a " _Company Fixed RSU_ ") and each
Share Unit that is not a Company Fixed RSU (a " _Company Variable RSU_ "), in
each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into a restricted share unit with respect to a number of
Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Share) equal to (i)
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to
such Share Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Adjusted
Share Unit_ "); provided, that in the case of any Company Variable RSU, for
purposes of clause (ii) above, the number of Company Shares in respect of such
Company Variable RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to be the greater of (A) the number of Company Shares determined using the
Companys actual performance as of the last completed calendar quarter prior
to the Effective Time, as determined by the Compensation and Nominating
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Effective
Time after reasonable consultation with Parent, and (B) the target number of
Company Shares subject to such Company Variable RSU as set forth on Schedule
2.03(a). Except as provided in this Section 2.03(a), each Adjusted Share Unit
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the related Share Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the ability to satisfy any

 



7  required withholding obligations upon vesting and settlement of such
Adjusted Share Unit through net settlement, and except that the performance-
based vesting requirements applicable to a Company Variable RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the Effective Time
and each such Company Variable RSU shall be treated as a Company Fixed RSU).

 

(b) _Dividend Equivalent Payment_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the holder of each Share Unit shall be entitled to an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to any accrued dividend equivalent payments, plus the
Special Dividend, and any other extraordinary cash dividends, pursuant to the
applicable Share Unit agreement or any action taken in compliance with
this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate,
the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company or any duly-authorized committee thereof administering the Company
Share Plans) under the applicable Company Share Plan that remain unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Share Unit Consideration_ ").

 

(c) _Rights of Share Unit Holders_. Following the Effective Time, the holders
of Share Units shall have the right to enforce, and shall be beneficiaries
with respect to, the provisions of Sections 2.03(a), 2.03(b) and 2.04.

(d) _Parent Actions_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for
future issuance a number of Parent Shares at least equal to the number of
Parent Shares that will be subject to the Adjusted Share Units. Not later than
the Closing Date, Parent shall file an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject
to such Adjusted Share Units and shall distribute a prospectus relating to
such Form S-8, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of such prospectus) for so long as such
Adjusted Share Units remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if
any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to administer any Adjusted Share Unit in
a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to
the extent such Adjusted Share Unit complied with such rule prior to the
Merger.

(e)  _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take any such actions with respect to the
Company Share Plans as are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.03.

Section 2.04 _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. (a) Promptly
after the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than thirty (30) days
following the Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall pay through its
payroll systems the Share Unit Consideration due pursuant to Section 2.03(b)
to the holders of Share Units.

 

(b) _Withholding_. Payment of the Share Unit Consideration pursuant to Section
2.03 shall be subject to withholding in accordance with Section 2.02(i).

 



8 Section 2.05 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_. (a) At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
such holder is entitled to receive, and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall,
in the event that the fair value of a Dissenting Share as appraised by the
Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act
(the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is greater than the Merger Consideration, be
entitled to receive such difference from the Company by payment made within
thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined
pursuant to such appraisal procedure.

 

(b) In the event that a holder fails to exercise, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_ ")
such holders Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
such Dissenting Share.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any other
instruments, notices, petitions or other written communication received by the
Company in accordance with this Section 2.05 and (B) to the extent that the
Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely
take any other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the
Bermuda Companies Act. Payment of any amount payable to holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding Parent Shares or Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction.

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
(A) set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (it being understood that any information set forth on one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that

 



9  it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
information is relevant to such other section or subsection) or (B) disclosed
in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document (i) filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC since January 1, 2014 by the Company and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Filed SEC
Documents_ ") or (ii) solely with respect to representations and warranties
relating to Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited
liability company (" _BCRH_ "), or any of its Subsidiaries, filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by BCRH since January 1, 2014 and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, in the case of each of the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), other than disclosure contained in the "Risk Factors" or
"Forward Looking Statements" sections of such documents or that otherwise
constitute risk factors or forward looking statements of risks generally faced
by participants in the industries in which the Company or BCRH operates
without disclosure of specific facts and circumstances:

Section 3.01 _Organization; Standing_. (a) The Company is an exempted company
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
Bermuda. The Company has all requisite power and authority necessary to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its
assets and properties, except (other than with respect to the due
incorporation and valid existence of the Company) as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. A true and
complete copy of each of the Company Organizational Documents is included in
the Company Filed SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of the
Company Organizational Documents and no Subsidiary of the Company is in
violation of any of its organizational documents, except as would not be
material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except as would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

Section 3.02 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized share capital of the Company
consists of 1,200,000,000 Company Shares and 6,000,000 preferred shares, par
value 1/6 cent per share. At the close of business on March 27, 2015 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 43,799,253 Company Shares (excluding any
treasury shares which may be deemed to be issued) and 6,000,000 Company
Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) 1,314,588 Company Shares
were held by the Company and its Subsidiaries as treasury shares, (iii)
1,302,811 Company Shares were issuable in respect of outstanding Company
Fixed RSUs and (iv) 828,920 Company Shares were issuable in respect of
outstanding Company Variable RSUs (assuming attainment of all applicable
performance goals at the maximum level for payout). Since the
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, other than in
connection with the vesting or settlement of Share Units in accordance with
their terms, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (1) issued
any Company Securities or incurred any obligation to make any payments based
on

 



10  the price or value of any Company Securities or dividends paid thereon that
were outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, other than dividend
equivalents with respect to Share Units, or (2) established a record date
for, declared, set aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or made any
other distribution in respect of, any shares of the Companys capital stock.
Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, on a holder-by-holder basis,
of the following information: the number of Company Shares subject to any
outstanding Company Fixed RSUs, the number of Company Shares subject to any
outstanding Company Variable RSUs at target level and maximum level, the grant
dates and the vesting schedules.

(b) Except as described in this Section 3.02, as of the Capitalization Date,
there were (i) no outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company, (iii) no outstanding
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company, or that obligate the Company to issue, any capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the Company to grant,
extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or
exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company (the
items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to collectively as
" _Company Securities_ ") and (v) no other obligations by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any
Company Securities or dividends paid thereon. Other than the Share Units,
there are no outstanding agreements or instruments of any kind that obligate
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company Securities (or obligate the Company to grant, extend or
enter into any such agreements relating to any Company Securities) or that
grant any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights
of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any Company Securities.
Except as described in this Section 3.02, no direct or indirect Subsidiary of
the Company owns any Company Shares. None of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company is a party to any shareholders agreement, voting trust
agreement, registration rights agreement or other similar agreement or
understanding relating to any Company Securities or any other agreement
relating to the disposition, voting or dividends with respect to any
Company Securities. No holder of securities in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any right to have such securities registered by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. All outstanding Company Shares and Company
Preferred Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

(c) The Company Shares and the Company Preferred Shares constitute the only
outstanding classes of securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Exchange
Act_ ").

(d) Section 3.02(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary of the Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (except
for directors qualifying shares or the like) are owned,

 



11  directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Company free and
clear of all Liens and material transfer restrictions, except for such Liens
and transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Act_ ") or other
applicable securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other equity or
voting interests). Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary
of the Company that is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company, is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, and there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements
relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or sale of any
shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of any Subsidiary
of the Company, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any agreements granting any
preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first
refusal or similar rights with respect to any securities of any Subsidiary of
the Company. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding
equity compensation plans relating to the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company. Other than with respect to
the Trust Preferred Securities, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any payments based on the price
or value of any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company or dividends paid
thereon.

 

(e) Section 3.02(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, all of the shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, each Blue Capital Entity that are owned,
directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Company or by any
Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Blue Capital Securities_ "). All of
the Blue Capital Securities are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, free and clear of all Liens and material transfer restrictions
other than transfer restrictions, of general applicability as may be provided
under the Securities Act or other applicable securities Laws.

Section 3.03 _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_. (a) The
Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
Statutory Merger Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, have been duly and unanimously authorized and approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company, and, except for obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, executing and delivering the Statutory Merger Agreement
and filing the Merger Application with the Registrar pursuant to the Bermuda
Companies Act, no other action on the part of the Company is necessary
to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 



12 (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that
the Merger Consideration constitutes fair value for each Company Share in
accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act, (ii) determined that the Merger, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, is fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, (iii) approved this
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Transactions and (iv)
resolved, subject to Section 5.02, to recommend approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement to the holders of Company Shares
(such recommendation, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). The Board of
Directors of the Company has directed that the Merger, this Agreement and the
Statutory Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Company Shares for
their approval.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Statutory Merger Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions, nor performance or compliance by the Company with
any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) contravene, conflict with or
violate any provision (A) of the Company Organizational Documents or (B) of
the similar organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
(ii) assuming (A) compliance with the matters set forth in Section 4.03(b)

representations and warranties made in such Section 4.03(b)), (B) that the
actions described in Section 3.03(a) have been completed, (C) that the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.04 and the

its Subsidiaries, (y) violate or constitute a breach of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, debenture, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease, sublease, license, contract or
other agreement (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the assets or properties of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are bound, or give rise to any
right to terminate, cancel, amend, modify or accelerate the Companys or, if
applicable, any of its Subsidiaries, rights or obligations under any such
Contract or (z) result in the creation of any Lien on any properties or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause
(i)(B) and clause (ii), as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Subject to the voting cutback provisions contained in bye-law 51(1) of the
Company Bye-Laws and the Preferred Share Redemption occurring prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
the holders of more than 50% of the Company Shares entitled to vote at the

necessary to approve this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the
Merger.

or approval of, or filing, license, permit or authorization, declaration or
registration with, or notification to, or waiver from, any Governmental
Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, other than such other
consents, approvals, filings, licenses, permits or authorizations,
declarations, registrations, notifications or waivers that, if not obtained,

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

any extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other

Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date
of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding written comments from the SEC with
respect to Company SEC Documents.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company (including all
related notes or schedules) included or incorporated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all

 



14  material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC
or other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except (i) as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or (ii) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its

Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each

of Parent to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right,

collectively as " _Parent Securities_ ") and (v) no other obligations by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or
value of any Parent Securities or dividends paid thereon. There are no
outstanding agreements or instruments of any kind that obligate Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Parent
Securities (or obligate Parent to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreements relating to any Parent Securities) or that grant any preemptive
rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or
similar rights with respect to any Parent Securities. Except as described in

and of record, by Parent free and clear of all Liens and material transfer
restrictions, except for such Liens and transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or other applicable
securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests). Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of
Parent that is held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and

including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement, any agreements granting any preemptive rights,

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation by the Company; Change in Recommendation_. (a)
The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and other
Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with respect to a Takeover Proposal that are
ongoing on or prior to the date of this Agreement and shall promptly request
from each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement with the
Company within the two-year period prior to and ending on the date of this
Agreement in connection with its consideration of making a Takeover Proposal
(an " _Existing Confidentiality Agreement_ ") that it promptly return or
destroy (as provided in the terms of the applicable Existing Confidentiality
Agreement) any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries previously furnished or made available to such Person or any of
its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives. The
Company shall promptly inform its Representatives of the Companys
obligations under this Section 5.02 and shall be liable for any action taken
by any Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02. Upon becoming aware of any action by
any Representative of the Company that would constitute a breach of this
Section 5.02 if taken by the Company, the Company shall stop any such
Representative from continuing to take such action, directly or indirectly.

 

(b) Subject to Section 5.02(c), from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VII, the Company (including, as

each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries or
requests for information regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover
Proposal;

 

(ii) amend, waive or fail to enforce any standstill or confidentiality
obligation of any Person under any Existing Confidentiality Agreement (other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries);

(iii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (except
to notify a Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.02) or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person in connection with,

Parent, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (D) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover
Proposal or refrain from recommending against any Takeover Proposal that is a
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days after the

publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) business
days of a written request by Parent to make such public reaffirmation
following the receipt by the Company of a public Takeover Proposal (other than
in the case of a Takeover Proposal in the form of a tender offer or exchange
offer) that has not been withdrawn; _provided_ that Parent may make any such
request only once in any ten (10) day period (each, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or 

(v) enter into or publicly propose to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement or agreement in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal,
other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (1) the
Company and its Representatives may contact any Person making a Takeover
Proposal delivered to the Company after the date of this Agreement and that
did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02 solely to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof, to request that any Takeover Proposal made
orally be made in writing and to negotiate an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (2) subject to the Companys compliance with the provisions of
this Section 5.02, including (in the case of a Takeover Proposal) the
execution and delivery of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
and its Representatives and the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
permitted to, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was
delivered to the Company after the date of this Agreement and did not result
from any breach of this Section 5.02 or, in the case of clause (iii), in
response to a Company Intervening Event, take the actions set forth in this
Section 5.02(c):

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person (and its
Representatives) who has made such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover
Proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines (A) in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under
Bermuda Law;

(ii) furnish or disclose any information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives), if the Board of Directors of the Company determines (A) in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be

 



48  reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company under Bermuda Law, but only so long as the Company has caused
such Person to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that all such information (other than non-intentional, immaterial omissions
therefrom) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; or

(iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (A) in the case of a Takeover
Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company determines (1) in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company under Bermuda Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (y) the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change until after the third business day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board
of Directors of the Company (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and a new three (3) business day period) and (z) during such
period following Parents receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal, in
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, (I) the Company
shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if accepted, shall have, and shall
have caused its Representatives to have, negotiated in good faith with)
Parent and its Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent as would enable the Company to
proceed with the Merger and the other Transactions without making an
Adverse Recommendation Change and (II) the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have determined, after considering the results of such negotiations and
the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such Notice of Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal; or (B) a Company Intervening Event has occurred and the Board of
Directors of the Company determines, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under Bermuda
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change until after the second
business day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take
such action, and specifying the reasons therefor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the
Company of its obligation to submit to a vote of the Companys shareholders
the approval of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, in order
to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

For the avoidance of doubt, the actions permitted by this Section 5.02(c) may
be taken only in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was
delivered to the Company after the date of this Agreement and that did not
result from any breach of this Section 5.02, or to a Company Intervening
Event, and not for any other reason.

 



49 (d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by, or communication to, the Company or
its Representatives) upon receipt of any Takeover Proposal or inquiry,
indication, proposal or offer by any Person that would reasonably be expected
to result in a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly
with the identity of such Person, a description of the terms of such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry, indication, proposal or offer, and provide to Parent
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by,
or communication to, the Company or its Representatives) unredacted copies of
all material correspondence or other material written documentation with
respect thereto (and written summaries of any material oral communications).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the
status of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication, proposal or offer.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to (i) disclose to the
shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act and (ii) make
such other public disclosure if it determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under
Bermuda Law; it being understood, however, that this Section 5.02(e) shall not
be deemed to permit the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to in clause (iii)
of Section 5.02(c) except, in each case, to the extent expressly permitted
by Section 5.02(c). Any public disclosure by the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof relating to a Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Board
of Directors of the Company, unless the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall be permitted to (i) disclose to the shareholders of
Parent a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act and (ii) make such other public
disclosure if it determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of Parent under Bermuda Law; it being
understood, however, that this Section 5.02(f) shall not be deemed to permit
the Board of Directors of Parent to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change or take any of the actions referred to in Section 5.03(b) except, in
each case, to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.03(c). Any public
disclosure by Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee
thereof relating to a Parent Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change by the Board of Directors of Parent, unless the
Board of Directors of Parent reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation in such
disclosure.

 

Section 5.03 _Preparation of Joint Proxy/Prospectus; Shareholders Meetings_.
(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be
filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable joint proxy statement/prospectus

proxy statement/prospectus, including any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and Parent shall prepare,
together with the Company, and file the Registration Statement (of which the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall form a part) with respect to the
issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Transactions. Each of the
Company and Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary to prepare and

(ii) cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement prior to filing such with
the SEC with respect to the filings made on or after the date of

all such filings made with the SEC. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the (A) Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and (B) Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the
times of the meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the
Transactions, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; _provided_ , _that_ , in each case of (A) and (B),
neither party shall be responsible or liable for any statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the other
party for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein;

(iii) cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no
representation or warranty shall be made by either

 



51  such party with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by the other party for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement;

(v) advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares
issuable in connection with the Transactions for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement; and

(vi) promptly notify the other party if at any time prior to the Effective
Time it discovers any information relating to either of the parties, or their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of Parent and the Company, to the extent required by Law.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval (the " _Parent
Shareholders Meeting_ "), and in any event within forty five (45) days
following the date on which the Registration Statement becomes effective.
Subject to Section 5.03(c), (x) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit and secure the Parent Shareholder Approval in accordance with
applicable legal requirements and (y) the Board of Directors of Parent shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Subject to Section 5.03(c), from the date of this

five (5) business days of a written request by the Company to make such
public reaffirmation following the receipt by Parent of a public Parent
Takeover Proposal (other than in the case of a Parent Takeover Proposal in the
form of a tender offer or exchange offer) that has not been withdrawn;
_provided_ that the Company may make any such request only once in any ten
(10) day period (each, a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation_

 



52   _Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit to a
vote of Parents shareholders the approval of the Parent Share Issuance, in
order to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval at the Parent Shareholders
Meeting.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall be permitted to, at any time prior to obtaining the
Parent Shareholder Approval, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if
(and only if) a Parent Intervening Event has occurred and the Board of
Directors of Parent determines, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent under Bermuda Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of Parent shall not make
such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change until after the second business
day following the Companys receipt of written notice from Parent advising
the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent intends to take such action,
and specifying the reasons therefor.

 

(d) The Company shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ "), and in any event within forty five (45) days
following the date on which the Registration Statement becomes effective.
Subject to Section 5.02(c)(iii), (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and secure the Company Shareholder Approval in accordance
with applicable legal requirements and (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

(e) The Company hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to the Voting Agreement,
each of the shareholders of the Company party thereto has irrevocably granted
to and appointed Parent and up to two (2) of Parents designated
representatives as such shareholders proxy to vote all of the Company Shares
(subject to the limitations on voting rights set forth in Section 51(1) of the
Company Bye-Laws) held by such shareholder at the Company Shareholders
Meeting, solely on the matters and in the manner specified in such Voting
Agreement. The Company further agrees that during the Voting Period (as
defined in the Voting Agreement), it shall recognize the grant of any such
proxy and the exercise thereof by Parent or one of its
designated representatives in accordance with the terms thereof at any
meeting of the shareholders of the Company (including the Company Shareholders
Meeting and any adjournment, reconvenement or postponement thereof), subject
to applicable Law. The Company shall implement the voting cutback provisions
of Section 51(1) of the Company Bye-Laws consistent with past practice in
connection with the determination of the Company Shareholder Approval.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company or Parent may adjourn, recess, reconvene or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting or Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, (i) after
consultation with the other party, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
is provided to the shareholders of such party within a reasonable amount of
time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders
Meeting, as applicable, or (ii) after consultation with the other party, if as
of the time for which the Company

 



53  Shareholders Meeting or Parent Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient
Company Shares or Parent Shares, as applicable, present (either in person or

to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall refer to the proxy statement
for the Parent Shareholders Meeting and the combined proxy
statement/prospectus for the Company Shareholders Meeting with all necessary
changes being made.

the Company and Parent shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other

Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the

its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege or expose
the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal

 



56  information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver
of such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
5.07 shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company. Until the
Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the
letter agreement dated as of December 17, 2014 by and between the Company and
Parent (as may in the future be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(b) Parent shall not be deemed to violate any of its obligations under the

under this Agreement.

Section 5.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) From and after the Effective

Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions
by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that no Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against any liability which by virtue of any rule of law attaches
to such Indemnitee in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of which such
Indemnitee may be guilty in relation to the Company, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries
as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in existence
as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification between the
Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the
memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.
In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel)
of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.08 (including in connection with
enforcing the indemnity and 

 



57  other obligations referred to in this Section 5.08) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the individual
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section 5.08(a).

 

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.08 (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought
by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company
and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual
premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium
(such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide
or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium. The Company may in consultation with Parent, and at the
request of Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase, for an
aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years, a
six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail" policy
has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.08(c) and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.08
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any

 



58  Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies unless (A) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08 applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.08.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

Section 5.09 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_. (a) Subject to applicable Law, for a period
of one (1) year following the Effective Time or such shorter period as a
Company Employee remains an employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Company (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns) to provide, to each individual who is employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Company Employee_ "), an annual rate of base salary and total
direct target compensation opportunity (base salary plus target annual
incentive compensation plus target long-term incentive compensation) that are
each no less favorable than the base salary and total direct target
compensation opportunity provided to such Company Employee by the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide, the Company Employees with employee benefits that are no
less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), Parent shall provide
to each Company Employee who terminates employment during the Continuation
Period severance benefits at least equal to and on terms and conditions no
less favorable than the severance benefits and terms and conditions as set
forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



59 (c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans but excluding any equity or equity-based plans), for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each
Company Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was
recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary as of the Effective Time in
accordance with past practice) shall be treated as service with the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the occurrence of
the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control".

 

(f) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parents obligations under this Section 5.10
shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable Law
that applies in relation to the employment or terms of employment of such
Company Employee.

 

(g) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide each
Company Employee continuing employment following the Effective Time a payment
with respect to such Company Employees annual bonus under the Companys
annual bonus plan in respect of the Companys fiscal year 2015 in accordance
with the terms set forth in Section 5.10(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(h) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section
5.10 or any other provision of this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of

 



60  the Company or any of its Affiliates, or Parent or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or (iii) is intended to or shall confer upon any current (including any
Company Employee) or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by
reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment.

whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the

action taken by their respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ , _however_

failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right

exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.04 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the

their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

Section 8.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
together with the exhibits and schedules attached hereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both

them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) are not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except for, if the Effective Time

Consideration payable in accordance with Article II and (ii) the provisions
set forth in Section 5.08 of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties

74  warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.03 without notice or liability to any other Person. Persons other
than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties
in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of

Section 8.07 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely in

applicable conflict of laws principles, except to the extent any provisions of
this Agreement which relate to the exercise of a directors or officers
fiduciary duties, statutory duties, obligations and/or statutory provisions,
or which arise under, the Laws of Bermuda (including those applicable to the
Merger) shall be governed by and in accordance with the Laws of Bermuda.

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the
extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda) shall be
heard and determined in the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (the
"Chosen Courts") and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack
of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.07(b)
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon
such party in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the
address set forth in Section 8.11 of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

 

Section 8.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of
them hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the right of the Company or Parent to cause the Merger
to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement) in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree not to

 



75  assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy
of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY

AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
