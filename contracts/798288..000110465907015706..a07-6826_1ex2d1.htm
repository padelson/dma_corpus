 **ARTICLE II 
  
  _THE OFFER AND THE MERGERS_**

  

Section 2.01 _The Offer_.

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article IX, and none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c)
(to the extent performance is required theretofore), (e) and (f) of Annex I
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, MergerSub
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange

        

Act) an offer to purchase all outstanding Company Common Shares at the Offer
Price, and shall, upon commencement of the Offer but after affording the
Company reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, file a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") and all other necessary documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and make all deliveries, mailings and
telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, in each
case in connection with the Offer (the " _Offer Documents_ "), and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Annex I hereto (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), MergerSub shall, as soon
as possible after the expiration of the Offer (or, if applicable, the
expiration of the "initial offering period"), accept for payment, and pay for
(after giving effect to any required withholding Tax), all Company Common
Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the first
date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). MergerSub and the
Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and MergerSub shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented,
to be disseminated to holders of shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal securities laws. MergerSub shall provide the
Company with (in writing, if written), and shall consult with the
Company regarding, any comment (written or oral) that may be received by
MergerSub or its counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof.  The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any such written and oral comments and proposed responses.

  

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Company, MergerSub shall not
decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, decrease the number of Company Common Shares sought to be purchased in
the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term
of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Shares.
MergerSub may, in its sole and absolute discretion, increase the price per
Company Common Share payable in the Offer without the consent of the Company.
The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day
(as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3)
and 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). MergerSub expressly reserves
the right to waive any condition to the Offer ( _provided_ that any waiver
of the Minimum Tender Condition shall require the prior written consent of
the Company) or modify the terms of the Offer, subject to compliance with
the Exchange Act and the first sentence of this subsection (b); _provided_
 that all such modifications to the terms of the Offer (other than
a modification to increase the Offer Price or to waive a condition to the
Offer) shall not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to delay the
Acceptance Date by more than ten Business Days after the first public
dissemination of notice of any such modification. Except as expressly
provided in this subsection (b), MergerSub shall not extend the Offer if all
of the conditions of the Offer are satisfied or waived and it is permitted
under applicable Law to accept

        

for payment and pay for tendered shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
MergerSub shall extend the Offer at any time, and from time to time: (1) if
at the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Tender Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_  that any extension shall be
in increments of not more than three Business Days (unless a longer period of
time is agreed to by the Company in writing, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld); (2) for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer;
or (3) if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived, and
Company Common Shares have been accepted for payment, but the number of
Company Common Shares acquired by MergerSub (together with other Company
Common Shares owned of record by the Buyer Parties or any of
their Affiliates) represent less than 90% of the votes entitled to be cast by
the holders of the then outstanding number of Company Common Shares and
Company Series D Preferred Shares (after reflecting and taking into account
any adjustment to the number of votes such holders have relative to holders
of Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Series
D Preferred Shares), voting together as a class, for an aggregate period of
not more than ten Business Days (for all such extensions pursuant to this
clause (3)) as a "subsequent offering period" (the " _Subsequent Offering
Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act. Nothing
contained in this paragraph shall affect any termination rights in Article
IX.  Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and
the satisfaction of all the Tender Offer Conditions as of any date on which
the Offer is scheduled to expire, MergerSub will accept for payment and pay
for all Company Common Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after such date.

  

Section 2.02 _Company Actions_.

  

(a) The Company shall, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC and mail to the holders of
Company Common Shares, as promptly as practicable on or after the date of the
filing by Parent and MergerSub of the Offer Documents, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") reflecting the
recommendation of the Company Board that holders of Company Common Shares
tender their Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents to the stockholders of
the Company as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby represents, that the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was
present throughout, has (i) determined that each of the Offer and the Merger
is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the Offer and this Agreement in accordance with the MGCL, (iii)
recommended acceptance of the Offer and that holders of Company Common Shares
tender their shares in the Offer (the " _Offer Recommendation_ ") and approve
the Merger by the Companys stockholders if such approval is required by
applicable Law (the " _Merger Recommendation_ "), and (iv) provided that the
representations in Section 5.08 are accurate and continue to be accurate
through the Acceptance Date, and subject to the Companys continued
qualification as a REIT, taken all appropriate and necessary actions to cause
the acquisition of Company Common Shares by the Parent and MergerSub in
connection

        

with the Offer to comply with or be exempted from any provision contained in
the Company Charter (other than the provisions in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) of
Article VII of the Company Charter), Company Bylaws or in the comparable
organizational document of any Company Subsidiary that would otherwise
prohibit, hinder or delay such transactions and render any and all
limitations on ownership of Company Common Shares as set forth in the Company
Charter (other than the provisions in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) of Article VII
of the Company Charter), including the Ownership Limit set forth in Article
VII of the Company Charter, inapplicable to the acquisition of Company Common
Shares by Parent and MergerSub in connection with the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
(as hereinafter defined) only prior to the acceptance for payment of Company
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, and in any case only to the extent
permitted by Section 7.04(d) (and then only after compliance with Section
7.04(c)). The Company hereby consents to the Offer and to the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of the Offer Recommendation and the Merger Recommendation
( _provided_ , that if there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, such change shall be reflected in the Offer Documents or amendments
thereto). The Company agrees reasonably promptly to correct the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall become false or misleading in any
material respect (and Parent, with respect to written information supplied by
it specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the
Company of any required corrections of such information and cooperate with
the Company with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement
the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information
that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders to
the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws.  The Company
shall provide MergerSub (in writing, if written), and consult with MergerSub
prior to responding to, any comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as promptly as
practicable after receipt of such comments.

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish MergerSub
with mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial
owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Shares as of the
most recent practicable date and shall furnish MergerSub with such
additional available information (including updated lists of holders of
Company Common Shares and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of
security positions and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other
assistance as the MergerSub or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Companys record and beneficial stockholders.
 Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent, MergerSub and their Affiliates,
associates, agents and advisors, shall keep such information confidential and
use the information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer terminate or
if this Agreement shall be terminated, Parent will, upon Companys written
request, deliver to the Company or destroy (and provide a certification of an
officer of Parent certifying to such destruction) all copies of
such information then in their possession.

        

Section 2.03 _Directors_.

  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon the payment by
Parent for Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and from time to time
thereafter Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (determined
after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Company Common
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its controlled Subsidiaries bears to
the total number of Company Common Shares then outstanding (including Company
Common Shares that are accepted for payment, but excluding any shares held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and the Company shall, upon request
of Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to
be so elected, including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or
more existing directors;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be
entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company
Board (as long as Parent and its controlled Subsidiaries beneficially own a
majority of the outstanding Company Common Shares, which for these purposes
shall exclude any Company Common Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two members who are (1)
not officers, directors, employees or designees of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (" _Purchaser Insiders_ ") or officers or directors of Affiliates
of the Company (other than by reason of being directors of the Company) or
officers or directors of any joint venture partner or participant (other than
the Company) or its Affiliates (" _Interested Persons_ "), (2) members of the
Company Board as of the date hereof, and (3) reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. If the number of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced
below two prior to the Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a
Purchaser Insider shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such
vacancy who is not a Purchaser Insider or Interested Person and who shall be
a director not deemed to be a Purchaser Insider or Interested Person for all
purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ that if the number of directors who
are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced to zero prior to the Effective Time, a
majority of the members of the Company Board at the time of the execution of
this Agreement shall be entitled to designate two Persons to fill such
vacancies who are not Purchaser Insiders or Interested Persons and who are
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and who shall be directors not deemed to be
Purchaser Insiders for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14-f
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
2.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to
the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section
and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03. Parent
will supply to Company any information with respect to itself and its
officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and Rule.

        

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this Section 2.03 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent, the waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, or the taking of
any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Company Board
will require the concurrence of the two directors of Company then in office
who are not Purchaser Insiders if such amendment, termination, extension or
waiver would or could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
stockholders of the Company other than Parent and its Affiliates. The
directors of the Company who are not Purchaser Insiders shall have the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
appropriate by such directors and shall have the authority to institute any
action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement.

  

Section 2.04 _Top-Up Option_.

  

(a) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(c) hereof, the Company grants
to MergerSub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions of
Article IX, to purchase from the Company at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price the number of authorized and unissued Company Common Shares equal
to the number of Company Common Shares that, when added to the number of
Company Common Shares owned by the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option or the taking of any action under
Section 3-106 of the MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02 (whichever is
greater), constitutes one (1) Company Common Share more than 90% of the votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of the then outstanding number of Company
Common Shares and Company Series D Preferred Shares (after reflecting and
taking into account any adjustment to the number of votes such holders have
relative to holders of Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Company Series D Preferred Shares), voting together as a class, on a
fully diluted basis (which assumes the exercise of all in-the-money options
for Company Common Shares vested and exercisable as of the Acceptance Date
and 60 days thereafter, at the time of the expiration of the Offer), that
would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Company Common
Shares subject to the Top-Up Option (such Company Common Shares subject to
the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ ").

  

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by MergerSub, in whole or in part,
only once, at any time during the 10 Business Day period following the
Acceptance Date, or if the Subsequent Offering Period is made available,
during the 10 Business Day period following the expiration date of the
Subsequent Offering Period and only if Parent and MergerSub collectively
shall own Company Common Shares as of such time entitled to cast less than
90%

        

of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the then outstanding
number of Company Common Shares and Company Series D Preferred Shares (after
reflecting and taking into account any adjustment to the number of votes such
holders have relative to holders of Company Common Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Company Series D Preferred Shares), voting together as a
class, on a fully diluted basis (which assumes the exercise of all in-the-
money options for Company Common Shares vested and exercisable as of the
Acceptance Date and 60 days thereafter, at the time of the expiration of the
Offer); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if
(A) the number of Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Top-Up
Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Company Common
Shares or (B) if any provision of applicable Laws or any judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority would prohibit, or
require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or the
Companys stockholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or
notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Company Common Shares being
purchased by MergerSub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price and shall be paid in
cash.

  

(c) In the event MergerSub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, MergerSub
shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth
(i) the number of Top-Up Shares that MergerSub intends to purchase pursuant
to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which MergerSub intends to pay
the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the
closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by MergerSub is to take place.
The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and
MergerSub that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of the
Top-Up Option, MergerSub intends to (and MergerSub shall, as promptly as
practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with the
MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, Parent and MergerSub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to MergerSub, a certificate
representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by
the Company pursuant to Section 10.02, and if not so consummated on such day,
as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with the MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02 as close in time
as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as)
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

  

Parent and MergerSub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered
under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. MergerSub
represents, warrants and agrees that the

        

Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by MergerSub
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
Act. Any certificates representing Top-Up Shares may include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

 **ARTICLE III 
  
  _EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS_**

  

Section 3.01 _Effects on Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of Company
Common Shares or holders of any shares of stock of MergerSub (other than the
requisite approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company):

        

(a) Each Company Common Share that is owned by the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company or by MergerSub shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

(b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
3.01(a)) shall automatically be converted into, and canceled in exchange for,
the right to receive an amount in cash to be paid by Surviving Corporation
equal to the Offer Price (the " _Company Common Share Cash
Merger Consideration_ "). At any time prior to the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, Parent may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
increase the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration without the
consent of the Company.

  

(c) Each (i) Company Series D Preferred Share issued and outstanding

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time as one share of 7.625% Series E

vested and exercisable (whether or not then vested or subject to any
performance condition that has not been satisfied, and regardless of the
exercise price thereof or the terms of any other agreement regarding the
vesting, delivery or payment thereof). The Company shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Share
Option not theretofore exercised shall be canceled in exchange for the right
to receive a single lump sum cash payment, less any applicable withholding
taxes, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time

of any other agreement regarding the vesting, delivery or payment thereof),
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Share Option
(the " _Option Merger Consideration_ "). If the exercise price per share of

of doubt, any restricted share awards (including any performance-based
restricted share award) granted on February 27, 2007 are included in the
Company Restricted Shares covered by this Section 3.01(e).

  

(f) The Buyer Parties acknowledge that, whether or not subject to any
performance condition that has not been satisfied, and regardless of any
other agreement regarding the vesting, delivery or payment thereof, all
deferred share units granted under the Incentive Plan and accounted for under
the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan (" _Company Share Rights_ ") shall
automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company Share Right shall
be considered an outstanding Company Common Share for all purposes of this

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par
value per share, of Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding common stock
of Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 3.02 _Effect on Units of Partnership Interest_.

and without any action on the part of the holder of any interest in Super
REIT MergerSub or DownREIT Partnership, each Existing Unit issued and

than any Existing Units held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
Existing Units shall remain outstanding and unchanged as units of limited
partner interest in the Surviving Partnership), subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, shall be converted, without any action on the
part of the holder, into the right to receive one fully-paid Class A
Preferred Unit, without interest, of the Surviving Partnership (the "
_Existing Unit Preferred Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
lieu of the

Existing Unit has effectively made and not revoked a valid election pursuant
to Section 3.02(c) to receive, in exchange for each issued and outstanding
Existing Unit held by such holder, a cash amount equal to the amount such
holder would have received if it had redeemed all of its Existing Units
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date for Company Common Shares pursuant
to the terms of the DownREIT Partnership Agreement in effect immediately
prior to the DownREIT Merger Effective Time, or such earlier time as may be
specified in such Election Form, and tendered such Company Common Shares in
the Offer (the " _Existing Unit Cash Consideration_ " and together with the
Existing Unit Preferred Consideration, the " _Existing Unit Consideration_
").

  

(b) At the DownREIT Merger Effective Time, the general partner interest of
the DownREIT Partnership shall remain outstanding and unchanged as a general

reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, for holders of Existing
Units to make an election to exercise the right to receive Existing Unit Cash
Consideration, including the deadline for making Elections and the procedures
(if any) for revoking an Election.

  

(ii) Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Election Form, (i) Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence, and (ii)
Parent and the Company shall, in cooperation with each other, prepare any
such amendment or supplement to the Election Form, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the indication of such satisfaction not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(iii) The Buyer Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with the Company in
preparing any disclosure statement or other disclosure information to
accompany the Election Form, including information applicable to an offering
of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

  

(iv) The respective obligations of the Company, Parent and Super REIT
MergerSub to consummate the DownREIT Merger shall be conditioned upon, and
shall be subject to, the closing of the Offer as provided in this Agreement.

applicable, in accordance with this Article III, of the Company Common Share
Cash Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration, the Existing Unit

with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates of the Company presented to the
Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation or the transfer agent for any reason

with respect to the Company Common Shares formerly represented thereby.
 From and after the DownREIT Merger Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the transfer books of the DownREIT Partnership of Existing
Units other than transfers of Continuing Units.  From and after the DownREIT

In connection with the Liquidation, holders of Company Series D Preferred

Liquidating Payment Amount on the Liquidation Payment Date.

        

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Certificates_.  Promptly after the Effective
Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately prior to
the Effective Time held Company Common Shares that were converted into the
right to receive the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.01: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the holders
Certificates in exchange for the Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by
Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the Company Common
Share Cash Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Common Shares, previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 3.03. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Company Common Share
Cash Merger Consideration.

  

(d) _Exchange Procedures for Existing Units_.  Promptly after the DownREIT
Merger Effective Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days),
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately
prior to the DownREIT Merger Effective Time held Existing Units that were not
represented by unit certificates (" _Uncertificated Units_ ") and that were
exchanged for the right to receive the Existing Unit Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.02: (i) a letter of transmittal (which letter shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of the Uncertificated
Units for the Existing Unit Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Uncertificated Units shall receive in exchange therefor the Existing
Unit Consideration payable in respect of the Existing Units previously held
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Existing Units that is not registered in the transfer records of
the DownREIT Partnership, payment may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name such records indicate if Parent shall be

        

presented with a proper form for such transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than indicated in such records or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until the procedures set forth in this Section 3.03(d) have been satisfied,
each Uncertificated Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Existing Unit Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 3.03(d) have been filed. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on the Existing Unit Consideration.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares, Company Share
Options or Existing Units Exchanged for Existing Unit Consideration_. At the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the right to
receive the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration provided under
this Article III. The Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Common
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the Company Common Shares exchanged theretofore and represented
by such Certificates. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to
Company Share Options in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the canceled Company Share Options, and on and after the
Effective Time the holder of a Company Share Option shall have no further
rights with respect to any Company Share Option, other than the right to
receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(d).
The Existing Unit Consideration paid with respect to Existing Units that
are exchanged therefor in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to such Existing Units, and on and after the Effective
Time the holder of any such Existing Unit shall have no further rights with
respect to any Existing Unit, other than the right to receive the Existing
Unit Consideration provided under this Article III.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Share
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Share Rights or Existing Units
which were exchanged for the right to receive the Existing Unit Consideration
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, and any holders of Company
Common Shares, Company Share Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company
Share Rights or Existing Units prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Surviving
Corporation or Parent for payment of the Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration or the Existing
Unit Consideration, as applicable.

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, MergerSub, Super REIT MergerSub,
Surviving Corporation, Surviving Partnership, the Company or the Paying
Agent, or any

        

employee, officer, director, stockholder, partner, member, agent or Affiliate
thereof, shall be liable to any person in respect of the Company Common Share
Cash Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or the Existing
Unit Consideration, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Surviving Corporation or
Parent, on a daily basis.  Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration, Option
Merger Consideration or the Existing Unit Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make all
such payments in full.

  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
reasonably may direct, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Section 3.04 _Effect on Out-Performance Plan_. The conditions for
maximum payment of the out-performance awards under the Companys 2006 Long-

consideration or distribution otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Company Common Shares, Company Share Options, Company Series D
Preferred Shares, Company Series E Preferred Shares or Existing Units such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by MergerSub, Surviving Corporation,

applicable,

        

such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Shares, Company Share

or Existing Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by MergerSub, Surviving Corporation, Super REIT MergerSub, Surviving
Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Party has
all requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to own, operate,
lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

  

(b) Each of the Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization

corporate, limited partnership, limited liability company or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such

Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for

standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation (and no event
has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of any
Participation Agreement, except for defaults or violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(m) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a

current taxes not yet due and payable, and liens or encumbrances which are
normal to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and are not, in
the aggregate, material in relation to the assets of the Company on a
consolidated basis and except also for such imperfections of title or
leasehold interest, easement and encumbrances, if any, as do not materially
interfere with the present use of the properties subject thereto or affected
thereby.

  

Section 4.14 _Intellectual Property_. Except as individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (a) to the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of
the Company and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe the
Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party, (b) with respect to
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted (" _Company
Intellectual Property_ "), the Company or such Subsidiary has the right to
use such Company Intellectual Property in the continued operation of its
business as currently conducted, and (c) all fees and filings required to

Section 4.15 _Taxes_. Except as set forth on Section 4.15 of
the Disclosure Schedule:

  

(a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or had
filed on their behalf) all material Tax Returns, as defined below, required
to be filed by them (after giving effect to any filing extension granted by a
Governmental Authority) and such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects, and (ii) has timely paid (or had timely paid on
their behalf) or all material Taxes (whether or not shown on such Tax
Returns) that are required to be paid by it under the applicable laws, rules
and regulations relating to the payment of such Taxes, other than those being
contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established
on the Companys financial statements as of December 31, 2006. The most
recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports, each
as amended to the date hereof, filed prior to the date hereof reflect an
adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax items) for all Taxes payable
(whether or not due at such time) by the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial
statements. True, correct and materially complete copies of all federal
income Tax Returns for the Company and the DownREIT Partnership with respect
to the taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2003 have been
delivered or made available to representatives of Parent. Neither the Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries has executed or filed with the IRS or any other
taxing authority any agreement, waiver or other document or arrangement
extending the period for assessment or

        

collection of material Taxes (including, but not limited to, any applicable
statute of limitation), which such agreement, waiver or other document or
arrangement is currently in effect, and no power of attorney with respect to
any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. As used herein, the term "Tax Returns" means all reports,
returns, declarations, statements or other information required to be
supplied to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes.

  

(b) The Company, (i) for each taxable year commencing with the Companys
taxable year ending December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2006, has been
subject to taxation as a "real estate investment trust" (a " _REIT_ ") within
the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements
to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since December 31,
2006 to the date hereof in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT
for the taxable year that includes the date hereof, and (iii) intends to
continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify
as a REIT for the taxable year of the Company that will include the
Acceptance Date. The Company has not taken any action or omitted to take any
action which would reasonably be expected to result in a successful challenge
by the IRS to its status as a REIT, and no challenge to the Companys status
as a REIT is pending or has been threatened in writing. No Subsidiary is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section
856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the meaning
of Section 856(1) of the Code.

  

(c) Each Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, trust or limited

1031(b) of the Code and that was timely reported on the Tax Returns of the
Company.

taxes under sections 856(c), 856(g), 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or
any rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code which has not yet been paid. To
the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, which presents a risk that any material Tax described in
the preceding sentence will be imposed on the Company. Neither the

        

Company nor any Subsidiary (other than a "taxable REIT subsidiary") has
engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the

or any Subsidiary as a result of any examinations by the IRS or any other
taxing authority of the Tax Returns of or covering or including the Company
or any Subsidiary have been fully paid, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no other material audits, examinations or other proceedings
relating to any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary by any taxing
authority in progress. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received
any written notice from any taxing authority that it intends to conduct such

foreign laws) and have duly and timely withheld and have paid over to the
appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

  

(i) To the knowledge of the Company, no claim has been made in writing by a
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Subsidiary does
not file Tax Returns that the Company or any such Subsidiary is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

(j) Neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary has requested any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return, which material Tax Return has not yet been filed.

  

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax sharing or
similar agreement or arrangement other than any agreement or arrangement
solely between the Company and any Subsidiary, pursuant to which it will have
any obligation to make any payments after the Acceptance Date.

        

(l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has requested or received a
private letter ruling from, or requested or entered into a binding agreement
with, the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing authorities relating to
Taxes.

the Tax Protection Agreements. No Person has raised in writing, or to
the knowledge of the Company threatened to raise, a claim against the Company
or any Subsidiary for any breach of any Tax Protection Agreement.

  

As used herein, " _Tax Protection Agreements_ " shall mean any written or
oral agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or otherwise
subject pursuant to which: (a) any liability to partners in the DownREIT
Partnership or any other Subsidiary or to any transferors of property to the
Company or any Subsidiary relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) the Company or any of the Subsidiaries have agreed to (i)

(u) fail to pay cash for any Existing Units tendered for exchange or
redemption under the DownREIT Partnership Agreement prior to the Closing Date
except to the extent, if any, the Company is obligated to issue Company
Common Shares in exchange therefor;

  

(v) take any action that would result in any of the conditions to the Offer

transaction contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof; and

  

(w) announce an intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a

materially delays consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or propose, announce an intention, enter into any agreement or
otherwise make a commitment, to take any such action, or (b) would cause any
of the representations or warranties of Buyer Parties contained herein to
become inaccurate in any material respect or any of the covenants of the
Buyer Parties to be breached in any material respect or result in the failure
to be satisfied of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01.

  

 **ARTICLE VII 
  
  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

  

Section 7.01 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Other Filings; Stockholders 
Meeting_.

  

(a) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 3-106 of the
MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Acceptance Date, the Company, acting through the
Company Board, shall in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws and NYSE rules: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following

        

clearance with the SEC of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of securing the
Company Stockholder Approval (such meeting, and any postponement or
adjournment thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), (ii) except to
the extent that the Company Board has effected or effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change prior to the Acceptance Date in accordance with the
terms of Section 7.04(d), advise and recommend to its stockholders the
approval of the Merger and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and the written opinion of the Financial Advisor, dated as of the date
hereof, to the extent set forth in Section 4.19 and (iii) use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from holders of Company Common Shares and Company
Series D Preferred Shares proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and take all other action necessary or advisable to secure, at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company Stockholder Approval.

  

(b) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 3-106 of the
MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Acceptance Date, or if the Subsequent Offering
Period is made available, following the expiration date of the Subsequent
Offering Period, the Company shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement, (ii) mail to its Stockholders the Proxy Statement a
sufficient time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (iii) otherwise
comply in all material respects with all legal requirements applicable to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Parent, MergerSub and the Company
will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and MergerSub will furnish as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all
SEC comments (in consultation with Parent) with respect to the Proxy
Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys Stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared with the SEC. Each of Parent,
MergerSub and the Company agree to correct as soon as reasonably practicable
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall
have become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information should be discovered by any party which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the
Stockholders of the Company. The Company shall as promptly as practicable
(i) notify Parent and MergerSub of the receipt of any oral or written
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by
the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

        

(c) At the Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall vote, and cause each
of its Subsidiaries to vote, all Company Common Shares owned by Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including all Company Common Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer in favor of the approval of the Merger.

  

Section 7.02 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. If, after the
consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number
of Company Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
MergerSub collectively represent at least 90% of the votes entitled to be
cast by the holders of the then outstanding Company Common Shares and Company
Series D Preferred Shares (after reflecting and taking into account any
adjustment to the number of votes such holders have relative to holders of
Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Series D
Preferred Shares), voting together as a class, Parent shall cause MergerSub
to, and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments
and take such other actions as Parent or MergerSub may request in order to,
cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable as
provided in Section 3-106 of the MGCL, and otherwise as provided in this
Agreement.

  

Section 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law and confidentiality agreements, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of
the Company and the Subsidiaries to afford Parent, following notice from
Parent to the Company in accordance with this Section 7.03, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, contracts, commitments, books and
records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and all other financial,
operating and other data and information and any other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of
its representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of
the Companys or Subsidiaries employees, agents, or representatives, unless
in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) contact or
have any discussions with any of the landlords/sublandlords,
tenants/subtenants, or licensees or franchisees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof, or (iv) perform
any onsite procedure or investigation (including any onsite environmental
investigation or study) without the Companys prior written consent. Parent
shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give
the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof,
setting forth the inspection or materials that Parent or its representatives
intend to conduct or review, as applicable, and Parent is required to give
the Company such written notice at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
date that any tenant of a Company Property which Parent wishes to inspect is
entitled to receive notice of any such inspection under the applicable
Company Lease. The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present
at all times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall

        

be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement, _provided_ that, if requested to do so
by Parent, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver from the counterparty.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent pursuant
to this Section 7.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement dated January 29, 2007 between Centro Properties
Group and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

Section 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  

(a) Subject to Sections 7.04(b), 7.04(c), 7.04(d) and 7.04(e), none of the
Company or any Subsidiary shall, nor shall any of them authorize or permit,
directly or indirectly, any of their respective officers, trustees,
directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants,
attorneys, brokers, finders or other agents, advisors or representatives
(each, a " _Representative_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action to facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information (other than public information
widely disseminated through SEC Reports, press releases or other similar
means)) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or other action that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations, or
furnish to any Person not a party to this Agreement any information in
furtherance of any inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in or permitted by Section 7.04(c)), or
(iv) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Offer Recommendation or Merger Recommendation (it being understood
that, subject to Section 7.04(e), publicly announcing that the Company
is taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), recommend,
adopt or approve, or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve, an
Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in this clause (iv), a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall take and cause its Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably
necessary to cause their respective Representatives to cease, immediately any
discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties that
are currently ongoing with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 7.04 shall preclude the Company, any Subsidiary or their
respective Representatives from complying with the provisions of the
last sentence of this Section 7.04(a). The Company and the Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for any failure on the part of their respective
Representatives to comply with this Section 7.04(a) or Section 7.04(b). The
Company shall promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement on or after

        

January 1, 2007 in connection with a potential transaction with (whether by
merger, acquisition, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise) the Company or
any Subsidiary, or any material portion of their assets, to return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary.

  

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing (as soon as is
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 24 hours from initial
receipt or occurrence) of any Acquisition Proposal or any negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the parties
and all material terms thereof) which any of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any such Representative may receive after the date hereof and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis as to the status, material terms
and conditions and any material developments regarding any such proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause any Subsidiary not to, terminate, release,
waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill agreement,
confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party and the Company shall, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted in its sole discretion to
terminate, release, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill
agreement, confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement entered into
by the Company prior to December 31, 2006.

  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a) and Section 7.04(b) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, following the receipt after the
date hereof, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date (and in no event after
the Acceptance Date), by the Company or any Subsidiary of a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated in
violation of Section 7.04(a) or Section 7.04(b)), the Company Board
may (directly or through Representatives) contact such Person and its
advisors for the purpose of clarifying the Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms thereof and/or the conditions to and its likelihood of consummation. If
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or may be reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, (i) furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
who made such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_  that the Company (1) has
previously or concurrently furnished such information to Parent and (2) shall
furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which
contains confidentiality terms and conditions not less restrictive to the
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) disclose to its stockholders
any information required to be disclosed under applicable Law and (iii)
participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal.

  

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any Committee thereof shall make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Date (and in no

        

event after the Acceptance Date), the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the duties of the Companys directors under applicable
Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) no Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be made until after the third (3rd) Business Day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (i) advising Parent that
the Company Board intends to take such action, (ii) if in response to a
Superior Proposal, advising Parent of the material terms and conditions of
any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new written notice be provided to Parent and a new three (3) Business Day
period), and (iii) representing that the Company has complied with this
Section 7.04(d) in all material respects, (B) during such three (3) Business
Day period, the Company, if requested by Parent, shall negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of
this Agreement and the Merger and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and (C) the Company shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal if, prior to the expiration of such
three (3) Business Day period, Parent delivers an irrevocable, legally
binding definitive agreement to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors) causes the Acquisition Proposal to no longer be
a Superior Proposal.

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company Board from (1) taking, disclosing and announcing to its
securityholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
_provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not relieve the Company of
any of its obligations under the provisions of this Section 7.04; (2) issuing
a "stop, look and listen" announcement, (3) complying with its obligations
under U.S. federal or state law regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or (4)
taking, refraining from taking, disclosing or announcing any action (or
intent to take any action) permitted by this Agreement or that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

  

Section 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor in accordance with
their terms the severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the
Company and the Subsidiaries that are listed in Section 7.05 of the
Disclosure Schedule (hereafter, the " _Scheduled Executive Contracts_ "). **
** Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any contrary
provision of a Scheduled Executive Contract, the transaction consummated as
of the Effective Time shall constitute "Good Reason" as that term is used in
the contract, and no "cure period" shall be required to give effect to the
severance rights of the employee to whom the Scheduled Executive Contract
relates. In addition, to the extent the Company determines, prior to the

        

Effective Time, that a "specified employee" payment delay is warranted in
order to avoid application of the excise tax under Section 409A of the Code,
payment of the severance amounts under each Scheduled Executive Contract
shall be delayed to the first business day after the six-month anniversary of
the employees date of termination. The execution of this Agreement shall be
treated as amending the Scheduled Executive Contracts to include the
provisions described in this Section 7.05(a).

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor in accordance with
their terms any other employment related contracts, agreements arrangements
and commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect that are
applicable to any current or former employees, officers or directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary or any of their predecessors, all of which are
listed on Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

(c) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
with respect to each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively,
the " _Company Employees_ ") who remains an employee of Surviving Corporation
or its successors or assigns or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the
" _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall provide the Continuing Employees
with total compensation and employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee will
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date
under the parallel employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the
same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under the respective Plan (except to the extent such
credit would result in the duplication of benefits and except with respect to
benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan).  In addition, with respect to
each health benefit plan, during the calendar year that includes the Closing
Date, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid by the
employee under the respective Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Parent or Surviving Corporation.

  

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, with respect to the Company
Employees who become Parent employees at the Effective Time, continue to
recognize all accrued and unused vacation days, holidays, personal, sickness
and other paid time off days (including banked days) that have accrued to
such employees through the Effective Time, and Parent will allow such
employees to take their accrued vacation days, holidays and any personal and
sickness days in accordance with such policies as it may adopt after the
Effective Time.

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the

        

Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ")
of Company Common Share Options to acquire Company Common Shares (or Company
Common Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company Restricted Shares)
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16.

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as
are necessary to terminate any share or investment-based non-qualified
deferred compensation account-based arrangements (collectively, the " _Non-
Qualified Account Plans_ ") and shall cause prompt payment of
amounts accumulated under any such Non-Qualified Account Plan to be made as
of the Effective Time, provided the Company has determined that such action
does not result in additional liability or expense to the Company, and is
taken in good faith compliance with the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code.

  

Section 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Date,
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof
through the Effective Date serving as a director, officer, trustee, or
fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in
effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to acts
or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who continues to be or has
ceased to be a

        

director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this Section 7.06(a): (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or
investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such Action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
maintained by any of the foregoing or any other person at or prior to the
Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other
reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including, without limitation,
experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.
Neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand,
Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerSub agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter,
bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or
other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.06(b) of the Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms.

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the operating
agreement of Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of

        

individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by Law and then only
to the minimum extent required by Law.

  

(d) Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six (6)
years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the
insured, _provided_ that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses
of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Effective Time; (ii)
in no event shall Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to
this Section 7.06(d) more than an amount per year of coverage equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more
than three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company, Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company.
Parent shall, and shall cause Surviving Corporation or its successors or
assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to
honor all obligations thereunder.

  

(e) If Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving limited liability company, partnership or
other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.06.

  

(f) Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.06 and the parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of
Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this Section 7.06.

  

(g) This Section 7.06 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, the DownREIT Partnership, Parent
and Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 7.06.

Section 7.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Offer, the Mergers and the Top-Up Option, including
using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits, consents,
approvals, waivers, exemptions, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the
Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the Mergers,
and (ii) execute and deliver any additional documents or instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. From the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, the Company shall timely file, or cause to be filed, with
the SEC all Company SEC Reports required to be so filed by applicable Law.

  

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 7.07, including the preparation and making of the filings referred to
therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information
thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the non filing party
and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, neither
of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any
Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party.
 Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent
practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto
shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings
and calls with such Governmental Authority.

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action,
including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts,
delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Offer, the Mergers or the
Top-Up Option, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

  

(d) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify
Parent with respect to any matter hereafter arising or any information
obtained after the date hereof which, if existing, occurring or known at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of

        

determining the accuracy of any representation or the satisfaction of the
conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, no
such supplement, amendment or information provided by the Company shall be
considered.

  

(e) In the event that any holder of the Convertible Notes shall surrender any
of its Convertible Notes for conversion on or prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Article 2 of the Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall
irrevocably elect pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Supplemental Indenture to
settle all amounts payable to such holder upon such conversion and surrender
of the Convertible Notes in cash at such time and in such manner as required
by the terms of the Supplemental Indenture.

  

(f) Without limitation to anything set forth in this Section 7.07(f), with
respect to the secured debt currently encumbering certain of the Company
Properties, at Parents request, the Company shall within a reasonable period
of time following receipt of Parents request (but not in any event later
than ten (10) days following receipt of such request, subject to any delays
caused by Parents review of the applicable request), promptly deliver
written requests for, and assist Parent in obtaining prior to the Closing
Date, consent to the Offer, the Mergers and the Liquidation from each lender
whose consent is required under the documents evidencing debt secured by the
Company Properties. If Parent has made such a request of the Company, the
Company shall provide copies of the written requests for consent to Parent or
its counsel not later than eight (8) days after receipt of Parents request
and prior to the delivery of the same and shall incorporate into
such materials any revisions reasonably requested by Parents counsel
(including, without limitation, the addition in any such document a request
for consent of the lender to a pledge of the interests in the Surviving
Corporation to Parents lender). In addition to the foregoing and without
limitation to anything set forth in this Section 7.07(f), at
Parents request, the Company shall, within a reasonable period of time
following receipt of Parents request (but not in any event later than ten
(10) days following receipt of such request, subject to any delays caused by
Parents review of the applicable request), with respect to the existing
secured debt that may be prepaid or defeased by the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary, promptly deliver written notices of prepayment or defeasance, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of the applicable loan documents,
provided that, in each such case, the terms of the applicable loan documents
governing such secured debt do not prohibit such a notice from being
revocable or conditional. The Company shall provide copies of any notices of
prepayment and/or defeasance to be delivered by the Company pursuant to the
foregoing sentence prior to the delivery of such notices.

  

(g) If requested by Parent, the Company and/or its applicable Subsidiary
shall promptly deliver written requests for, and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain within a reasonable period after such requests
are made, tenant estoppel certificates from each tenant occupying more than
10,000 square feet of space pursuant to a Company Lease, which tenant
estoppel certificates shall be the form previously executed by each such
tenant, or if no such form was previously executed by a tenant, in the form
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

        

(h) If any Company Title Insurance Policy shows title defects which would be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to
generate revenue at the Company Property as presently constructed or the
ability of Parent to obtain financing providing for a first priority mortgage
lien on the Company Property (a " _Major Title Defect_ "), and Parent has
delivered to the Company and its counsel an itemized written notice of such
Major Title Defects (" _Parent s Title Notice_") within ten (10) days after
the receipt of such Company Title Insurance Policy, then the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to
remove or cure such Major Title Defects identified prior to Closing.

  

(i) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Parent copies of (i) any notice of claim under a Company Title Insurance
Policy delivered by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a title insurer
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any notice of default delivered to a
tenant under a Material Property Lease prior to the Closing Date.

  

Section 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions
to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize
the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, subject
to applicable law, Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid,
without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to
holders of the Company Common Shares, Company Share Options, and Company
Restricted Shares, all Transfer Taxes.

  

Section 7.09 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger shall be issued by a party without
the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
Offer, the Merger and the execution of this Agreement.

  

Section 7.10 _Certain Tax Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the
Company shall cause all of its subsidiaries that are treated as
"qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the
Code to be merged or otherwise converted into limited liability companies
that are (i) disregarded for United States federal income tax purposes and
(ii) not treated as "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (the " _Conversion_ ").  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 9.01, none of the Buyer Parties shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement on the basis that any such merger or
conversion pursuant to this Section 7.10 either was not effected or, if
effected, shall have resulted in the breach of any covenant of the Company
under this Agreement. The

        

Company shall provide to Parent written evidence of the Conversion including
a schedule setting forth all of the subsidiaries so converted prior to the
Acceptance Date, and shall notify Parent prior to the Acceptance Date.

  

Section 7.11 _Financing; Cooperation with Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the debt financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ "), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to
satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements. In
the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall
arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt
Commitment Letter or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and Parent
shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter
without first notifying the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained, Parent shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Offer and the Mergers on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not substantially and unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including
without limitation, (a) delivering such financial and statistical information
and projections relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing, (b) making
appropriate officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries available for due
diligence meetings and for participation in meetings with rating agencies and
prospective sources of financing, (c) providing timely access to diligence
materials, appropriate personnel and properties to allow sources of financing
and their representatives to complete all appropriate diligence, (d)
providing assistance with respect to the review and granting of mortgages and
security interests in collateral for the Debt Financing, and attempting to
obtain any consents associated therewith, and (e) attempting to obtain
estoppels and certificates from tenants, lenders, ground lessors and
counterparties to REAs in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to any
potential lender. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any
reasonable costs incurred in performing their obligations under this Section
7.11(b).

        

Section 7.12 _NYSE Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_.  Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to
be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-
listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Shares and Company
Series E Preferred Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company
Common Shares and Company Series E Preferred Shares under the Exchange Act
promptly after the Effective Time.

  

Section 7.13 _Approval of Compensation Actions_. Prior to the
Expiration Date, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall
take all such actions as may be required to approve, as an employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement, any and all
Compensation Actions taken after January 1, 2007 and prior to the Expiration
Date that have not already been so approved.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII 
  
  _CONDITIONS TO THE MERGERS_**

  

Section 8.01 _Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party_.  The
respective obligations of the Company, Parent and MergerSub to consummate the
Mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver in writing (as permitted by
applicable Law) at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:

  

(a) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 3-106 of the
MGCL as contemplated by Section 7.02, the Company shall have obtained
the Company Stockholder Approval.

  

(b) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree, ruling or other legal
restraint or prohibition (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which

illegal or prohibiting consummation of the Mergers.

Common Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 **ARTICLE IX 
  
  _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

  

Section 9.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, as
follows (the date of any such termination, the " _Termination Date_ "):

  

(a) Subject to Section 2.03(c), by mutual written consent of Parent and the
Company;

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if November 30, 2007 (the " _Walk-Away
Date_ ") shall have occurred and the Offer shall not have been consummated on
or before the close of business on the Walk-Away Date, provided, that the
Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended to February 28, 2008 (and such
date shall then be the Walk-Away Date for all purposes of this Agreement) if
the only Tender Offer Condition that has not been or would not be satisfied
as of November 30, 2007 is the Tender Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph
(a) of Annex I; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available to a party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement was the primary
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer to be consummated on or
before the Walk-Away Date;

  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree, ruling or other legal restraint or prohibition or taken any other
action (including the failure to have taken an action) which, in any such
case, has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of enjoining,
restraining, preventing or prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, the Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation
of the Merger or making the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the
Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation of the Mergers
illegal (" _Governmental Order_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms
of this Section 9.01(c) shall not be available to any party unless such party
shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such
Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made
inapplicable to the Mergers;

  

(d) by Parent, if prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
paragraph (b) or (c) of Annex I and (B) is either incurable, or if curable,
is not cured by the Company by the earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt
by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure and (y) the Walk-
Away Date; _provided_ , at the time of the delivery of such written notice,
Parent shall not be in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement;

        

(e) by Parent, if prior to the Acceptance Date, (i) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (ii) the Company shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 7.04;

  

(f) by the Company, if prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent or MergerSub
shall have (A) failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement or (B)
breached any of Parents or MergerSubs representations and warranties
(without regard to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
contained therein), which breach or failure to perform, in the case of clause
(B), would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B)
is either incurable, or if curable, is not cured by Parent by the earlier of
(x) 30 days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or
failure and (y) the Walk-Away Date, _provided_ , at the time of the delivery
of such written notice, the Company shall not be in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and _provided_ , _further_ , that for
purposes of this Section 9.01(f), MergerSubs failure in any material respect
to commence or extend the Offer, or to purchase Company Common Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms of this Offer or this
Agreement, in any such case in violation of the terms of the Offer or this
Agreement, shall be deemed an incurable breach of this Agreement;

  

(g) by Parent, subject to its compliance with Section 2.01 and the other
provisions of this Agreement, due to a failure of the Tender Offer Conditions
to be satisfied at the Expiration Date and the Offer having expired or been
terminated without MergerSub having purchased any Company Common Shares
pursuant thereto; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(g) if Parents or
MergerSubs breach of this Agreement was directly or indirectly the cause of,
or directly or indirectly resulted in, the failure of any of the Tender Offer
Conditions to be satisfied or the failure of MergerSub to have accepted for
payment Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer;

  

(h) by the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been terminated
without MergerSub having purchased any Company Common Shares pursuant
thereto, _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) if the Companys failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or the failure of a
condition set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of Annex I was directly or
indirectly the cause of, or directly or indirectly resulted in, the Offer
having expired or having been terminated without MergerSub having purchased
any Company Common Shares pursuant thereto; or

        

(i) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Date, if the Company Board has
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ that for
such termination to be effective the Company shall have paid to Parent the
Company Termination Fee and Termination Expenses.

  

Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part
of any party hereto except that the provisions of Section 7.03(b)
(Confidentiality), Section 7.07(e), Section 7.12, this Section 9.02, Section
9.03 (Expenses) and Article X shall survive any such termination; _provided_
,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto
from liability for any breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination.

  

Section 9.03 _Notice of Termination_. A terminating party shall provide
written notice of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable
particularity the basis of such termination. If more than one provision in
Section 9.01 is available to a terminating party in connection with a
termination, a terminating party may rely on any or all available provisions
in Section 9.01 for any such termination.

  

Section 9.04 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.04, all expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(i) pursuant to Section 9.01(e)(ii), (A) at any time after the date hereof
and prior to the Acceptance Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced prior to such Termination Date (and such Acquisition
Proposal was not withdrawn prior to the Termination Date), and (B)
concurrently with such termination or within twelve (12) months following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement with any
third party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent, if and when
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal occurs, the Company Termination Fee
and Termination Expenses, less any amounts previously paid pursuant to
Section 9.04(b)(ii) (and for purposes of this Section 9.04(b)(i), "more than
50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal);

  

(ii) pursuant to Section 9.01(e)(ii), which breach was caused by the actions
of any person or persons listed on Exhibit A, then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee and Termination Expenses (and for purposes
of this Section 9.04(b)(ii), "$30,000,00.00 shall be substituted for
"$90,666,000.00" in the definition of "Company Termination Fee"); or

        

(iii) pursuant to Section 9.01(e)(i) or Section 9.01(i), then the Company
shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee and Termination Expenses.

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 9.01(i), the Company Termination Fee and
Termination Expenses shall be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in
writing in immediately available funds as soon as is reasonably practicable,
but in any event no more than three (3) Business Days following the event
giving rise to the obligation to make such payment.

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an
amount equal to $90,666,000.00 U.S. Dollars (ninety million six hundred
sixty-six thousand U.S. Dollars).

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Termination Expenses_ " shall be
the cash amount necessary to fully reimburse Parent, MergerSub, Super REIT
MergerSub and their Affiliates for all documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred (whether or not billed) at any time (whether before or
after the date hereof) prior to the termination of this Agreement by any of
them or on their behalf in connection with the Offer, the Mergers, the
transactions relating to the DownREIT Partnership contemplated herein, the
preparation of this Agreement, their due diligence investigation of the
Company and the DownREIT Partnership and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any currency or interest rate hedging activities
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), including (i) all
fees and expenses of counsel, investment banking firms, lenders or financial
advisors (and their respective counsel and Representatives), accountants,
experts and consultants to Parent, MergerSub or any of their Affiliates in
connection with the Offer, the Mergers, the preparation of this Agreement,
their due diligence investigation of the Company and the DownREIT Partnership
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all fees and
expenses payable to banks, investment banking firms and other financial
institutions (and their respective counsel and Representatives) in connection
with arranging or providing financing for the Company Common Share Cash
Merger Consideration, the refinancing of any properties or assets of the
Company or the DownREIT Partnership or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the aggregate
amount of the Termination Expenses to be reimbursed by the Company under this
Section 9.04 shall not exceed $20,000,000 U.S. Dollars (twenty million U.S.
Dollars).

  

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay each of the
Company Termination Fee and Termination Expenses when due, the Company shall
reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.04.

        

Section 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, MergerSub and Super REIT MergerSub,
on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
agreement of the other party or any condition to its own obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent (on behalf of
Parent, MergerSub and Super REIT MergerSub). The failure of any party to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person
or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  To such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 10.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto by action taken by their respective board of directors (or
similar governing body or entity) at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, after approval of the Merger by the

stockholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of the
NYSE, requires further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

        

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together
with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger,
by operation of law or otherwise).

  

Section 10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the

shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity.

  

Section 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Article III,
Section 7.05 and Section 7.06 (which are intended to be for the benefit of
the persons covered thereby or the persons entitled to payment or
indemnification thereunder and may be enforced by such persons).

  

Section 10.08 _Governing Law; Enforcement and Forum_. All disputes,
claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules of conflict of
laws; except for the provisions hereof which relate expressly to the DRULPA
or DLLCA (including, without limitation, the DownREIT Merger), which shall be
construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the DRULPA or DLLCA, as
applicable. Each of the Company Parties and the Buyer Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland or any court of the
United States located in the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Courts_ ")
for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum.  Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) to
the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the
State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland
as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service
of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service

above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Maryland.

a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

 **ANNEX I**

  

 **CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER**

  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or this
Agreement, MergerSub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, pay for any tendered Company
Common Shares if (i) there shall not be validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer, as it may be extended in accordance
with the terms of Section 2.01 (the " _Expiration Date_ "), that number of
Company Common Shares which, when added to any Company Common Shares already
owned by the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates (but excluding any
Company Common Shares acquired by exercising the Top-Up Option), represents
at least a majority of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by the
holders of the outstanding Company Common Shares and Company Series D
Preferred Shares (after reflecting and taking into account any adjustment to
the number of votes such holders have relative to holders of Company Common
Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Series D Preferred
Shares), voting together as a class, on a fully diluted basis (which assumes
the exercise of all in-the-money options for Company Common Shares vested and
exercisable as of the Acceptance Date and 60 days thereafter), at the time of
the expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "), or (ii) at
any time on or after the date of this Agreement and at the time of acceptance
for payment for any Company Common Shares, any of the following events shall
have occurred and be continuing:

  

(a) A Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree, ruling or other legal
restraint or prohibition (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which
is then in effect and has the effect of making the acceptance for payment of,
and payment for, Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation
of the Merger illegal.

  

(b) Any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any
"materiality" or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifier therein), as if
such representations and warranties were made at the time of such
determination (except to the extent such representations and warranties
relate to an earlier date, in which case only as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The Company shall have not performed in all material respects any
material obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under this Agreement.     

(d) The Company shall not have received a tax opinion of Hogan and Hartson
L.L.P. (or other nationally recognized tax counsel to the Company reasonably
satisfactory to Parent), substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ and dated as of the Acceptance Date, opining that the Company has
been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification as a REIT under the Code for all taxable periods commencing
with the Companys taxable year ended December 31, 1997, through and
including its taxable year ended December 31, 2006 and that the Companys
method of operation during the portion of calendar year 2007 prior to the
acquisition of Company Common Shares on the Acceptance Date would permit the
Company to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2007
(assuming that the Companys taxable year ended immediately prior to the
acquisition of Company Common Shares on the Acceptance Date and assuming the
Company satisfied the applicable distribution requirements under the Code).
Such opinion shall be based, in part, on customary assumptions and customary
factual representations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
representations included as an attachment to _Exhibit B_ ), and, with respect
to periods prior to September 28, 1998, certain prior opinions of Company
counsel, including the opinion of Latham and Watkins to the Company, dated
September 28, 1998, concerning the qualification of Excel Realty Trust, Inc.,
as a real estate investment trust from January 1, 1993 through September 28,
1998.

  

(e) Since the execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any
change, event, effect, or development which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(f) The Company and Parent shall have reached a mutual written agreement
either that the Offer be terminated or this Agreement be terminated, or the
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

  

(g) There shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental
Authority challenging the acquisition by any of the Buyer Parties of the
Company or any other Company Subsidiaries or of any Company Common Shares,
seeking to prohibit the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or seeking
any Governmental Order that would result in, or would reasonably be expected
to result in, a Substantial Detriment or would impose material limitations on
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to exercise full rights of
ownership of the Company Common Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer,
including the right to vote the shares purchased by it on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and MergerSub and may
be asserted by Parent and MergerSub regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such conditions (other than any such circumstances caused by or
substantially contributed to by any breach by any Buyer Parties of any
of their representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or     

obligations under this Agreement or any breach of the Debt Financing
commitment) and may be waived by Parent or MergerSub in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, in each case, subject
to the terms of the Agreement.  The failure by Parent or MergerSub at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right and waiving such right with respect to any particular facts or
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts or
circumstances, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time, in each case prior to the
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, tendered Company Common Shares.
