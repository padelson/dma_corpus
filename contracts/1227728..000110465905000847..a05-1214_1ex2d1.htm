# **MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  



  

Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  



  

### (a) Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share
(the " _Company Stock_ ") issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares of Company Stock owned by Purchaser or any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Purchaser; and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in

cash equal to $12.08 per share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and (2)
subject to the provisions of Section 5.02 hereof, one contingent value right
(" _CVR_ ").  Except as provided in this Section 2.01, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger, all shares of Company Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent (i) the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
(ii) the CVRs, payable in respect of such shares of Company Stock.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and
each share of Company Stock owned by Purchaser or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser or of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

###

### (a) _Paying Agent_. From and after the Effective Time, a bank or trust
company to be designated by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
the Company shall act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or before
the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall enter into an agreement with
the Paying Agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company. At or before the
Effective Time, Purchaser or Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates (as defined below), for use in the payment of the Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with Section 2.01, the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all outstanding shares of Company Stock and the
cash payable pursuant to Section 2.04(a) with respect to the Company Options.
Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Merger Fund_." The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions of Purchaser and the Company given on the Closing Date, make
payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger Fund. Except as
contemplated by Section 2.02(g) and Section 5.02(b) hereof, the Merger Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in
any case no later than five days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Stock whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01: (i) a
letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender for cancellation of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Purchaser, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.01, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled except as set forth in Section 2.05. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective time,
for all corporate purposes, to evidence ownership of the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the CVRs attributable to such Certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to the Principal Stockholders
on the day of the Effective Time and the Principal Stockholders shall be
entitled to prompt payment by wire transfer in accordance with the
instructions specified in such Letter of Transmittal.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Transfers or Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition of payment
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 3.15(q)) Law. Company
Stockholders shall timely provide the Purchaser, the Paying Agent, or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, with a duly executed IRS Form W-9
or W-8 or substitute form, upon reasonable request of the Purchaser, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation or their agents, employees or
representatives (it being understood that provision of such form shall not be
a condition to Closing). If Purchaser intends to withhold, or to cause the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation to withhold, any amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.02(d), then Purchaser shall provide notice in
writing to the Company of the amount of such proposed withholding no later
than four (4) business days prior to the Closing Date, which withholding
amounts shall be subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, upon receipt by the
Purchaser, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
of documentation or certifications, as required by applicable Tax Law in
order to avoid such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Paying Agent, the Surviving

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No liability_. Neither Paying Agent, Purchaser nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
amount properly and legally delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law (as defined in Section 3.06(a)).

  

### 

  

### (f) _Investment of Paying Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Merger
Fund in a money market account; provided that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of payments to the
Company Stockholders and holders of Company Options pursuant to this Article
II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become
a part of the Merger Fund and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
the Company Stockholders and holders of Company Options pursuant to this
Article II and Section 5.02 shall promptly be paid to the Purchaser (or,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

  

### 

  

### (g) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request and on the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance
with this Section 2.02 shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.

  

### 

  

Section 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.

  



  

### (a) All outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Stock (the "
_Company Options_ ") granted under the Stock Plan (as defined in Section
3.04(a)) shall vest in full and shall be cancelled upon the Effective Time.
In consideration for such cancelled Company Stock Options, the Company (or,
at Surviving Corporations option, Surviving Corporation) shall pay

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

### or deliver, in no event later than five (5) business days after the
Effective Time, to the holders of such cancelled Company Options in respect
of each such cancelled Company Option (i) a cash amount equal to the product
of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the
Option Price (as such term is defined in the Company Options), in effect
under such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Option (such
payment to be net of applicable withholding taxes, to the same extent as is
set forth in Section 2.02(d) with respect to Company Stock and without any
interest thereon, and subject to documentation and certification requirements
(as applicable to the holders of Company Options, it being understood that
such documentation and certification shall not be a condition to closing) and
to the notice requirements set forth therein) and (ii) a CVR in respect of
each share of Company Stock subject to such cancelled Company Option that has
an Option Price less than the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company has informed the Purchaser that the Company has taken
such actions as necessary to cause all restricted shares of Company Stock
(the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted before the date of this
Agreement to vest in full on an accelerated basis immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  All such Company Restricted Shares shall, at the Effective
Time, be considered shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time within the meaning of Section 2.01(a).

  

### 

  

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by Company Stockholders who have properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and CVRs. Such Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Stock held by them
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until
such Stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose
their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.  All Dissenting Shares
held by Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively
shall have withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares of
Company Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration and CVRs, without any
interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give the notice specified in Section 262(d)(1) of
the DGCL to all Company Stockholders in accordance with the requirements of
such Section.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company shall give Purchaser (i) reasonably prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

other assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and as

authority would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Significant Subsidiaries is

good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties

Section 5.02 _Sale of IDP Business_.

  



  

### (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall be entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to
sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell, convey,
transfer or dispose of, all of the assets and liabilities (if any) related to
the business referred to by the Company and the Purchaser as the IDP business
(the " _IDP Business_ " and any such sale, conveyance, transfer or
disposition being referred to as the " _IDP Sale_ ") to a third party (the "
_IDP Purchaser_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) Any such IDP Sale shall be subject to the reasonable consent of the
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), as evidenced by a
written instrument of the Purchaser delivered prior to the execution by the
Company of a definitive purchase and sale agreement (the " _IDP Agreement_ ")
with the IDP Purchaser, with respect to the following matters: (i) the assets
(including intellectual property rights) to be sold to, and the liabilities
(if any) to be assumed by, the IDP Purchaser, (ii) the accounts payable (if
any) and the accounts receivable (if any) to be assigned as part of the IDP
Sale, (iii) the real estate to be conveyed to the IDP Purchaser as part of
the IDP Sale, (iv) the employees to be transferred to (and the employee
compensation and benefits to be assumed by) the IDP Purchaser as part of the
IDP Sale, (v) any representations, warranties or indemnities of the Company
to the IDP Purchaser which will extend beyond the date of closing of the IDP
Sale (the " _IDP Closing_ "), and (vi) all supply and similar agreements
between the Company and the IDP Purchaser which will survive the IDP Closing.
Unless the prior written approval of the Purchaser has been obtained, the
Company shall not execute and deliver the IDP Agreement unless it provides
for a final, outside IDP Closing date which is not later than 60 days
following the anticipated Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, the purchase and
sale price for the IDP Business shall not be less than the "Minimum IDP Sale
Price."  For these purposes, the term " _Minimum IDP Sale Price_ " shall
mean (A) in the case of a IDP Closing which is to occur (and does occur)
prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash (or "Liquid Securities," as
such term is defined below) equal to $45 million plus (i) any and all Taxes,
current or deferred, resulting from such IDP Sale, and (ii) any costs, fees
and expenses (including investment banking, legal and accounting fees and
expenses) associated with such IDP Sale, and (B) in the case of a IDP Closing
which is to occur following the Effective Time (but within 60 days
thereafter), an amount in cash (or "Liquid Securities," as such term is
defined below) equal to $45 million plus (i) any and all Taxes, current or
deferred, resulting such IDP Sale, (ii) the amount of $6 million (to
reimburse the Surviving Corporation for the assumed costs of such IDP Sale,
whether such costs are more or less than $6 million) and (iii) an amount
equal to $7 million per month (or pro-rata portion thereof if less than a
month) for each 30-day period from the Effective Time to the IDP Closing
date. For purposes of this Section 5.02, the term " _Liquid Securities_ "
means equity securities which (1) have been or are being issued,
contemporaneously with the IDP Closing, by the IDP Purchaser or one of its
affiliates, (2) are listed and regularly traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange and denominated in U.S. Dollars, and (3) are freely
tradable by the holder thereof within five business days of the IDP Closing
Date.  Any Liquid Securities received in connection with a IDP Sale shall
be sold, at the best price obtainable using commercially reasonable efforts,
as soon as practicable (taking into account any restrictions described in
clause (3) of the preceding sentence) following the IDP Closing.

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

### (d) If a IDP Closing occurs prior to the Effective Time, then the Company
shall, simultaneously with the IDP Closing, deposit into a specially
designated account with a commercial bank the amount of $45 million (the "
_IDP Reserve Account_ ").  The IDP Reserve Account shall be invested in
accordance with Company investment policies and any income resulting
therefrom may be withdrawn by the Company from such Account. Except
with respect to such investment income, the amount on deposit in the IDP
Reserve Account shall not be used by the Company for any purpose other than
as described in the following sentence.  Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall transfer the $45 million in the IDP Reserve Account
to the Paying Agent for deposit in the Merger Fund, and the amount to be
deposited by the Purchaser or the Parent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) hereof
shall be net reduced by the amount so transferred from the IDP Reserve
Account to the Merger Fund. Any gross proceeds from a IDP Sale which
is realized from a IDP Closing occurring prior to the Effective Time and
which exceeds the Minimum IDP Sale Price (as defined in paragraph (c) (A) of
this Section 5.02) may be distributed by the Company to the Company
Stockholders in the form of a dividend at any time prior to the Effective
Time and, if the Company chooses to pay such dividend, no CVRs shall be
issued. In the event that a IDP Sale is consummated by the Company prior to
the Effective Time as provided in this Section 5.02, and the Company has not
distributed to the Company Stockholders prior to the Effective Time an amount
equal to the gross proceeds of a IDP Sale that exceed the Minimum IDP Sale
Price, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent
to promptly pay to each holder of a CVR a cash amount in respect of each such
CVR equal to (A) the excess, if any, of the gross proceeds of the IDP Sale
over the Minimum IDP Sale Price (as defined in paragraph (c)(A) of this
Section 5.02), divided by (B) the aggregate number of CVRs outstanding; 
_provided_ , that such amount shall not be required to be paid to any Company
Stockholder unless such holder is or has been otherwise entitled to Merger
Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.02.

  

### 

  

### (e) If a IDP Agreement is executed by the Company and the IDP Purchaser
prior to the Effective Time and the IDP Closing occurs not later than 60 days
following the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay and
distribute to each holders of a CVR an amount equal to (A) the excess, if
any, of the gross proceeds of the IDP Sale over the Minimum IDP Sale Price
(as defined in paragraph (c)(B) of this Section 5.02), divided by (B) the
aggregate number of CVRs outstanding; _provided_ that such amount shall not
be required to be paid to any holder of a CVR unless such holder is or has
been otherwise entitled to Merger Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.02 hereof or payment in respect of any
Company Options pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof. **** Any payment in respect
of a CVR shall be paid in accordance with the last known address for such
holder of a CVR maintained by the Company and the Paying Agent at the time of
such payment.

  

### 

  

### (f) No holder of a CVR shall be entitled to any proceeds of a IDP Sale as
to which a IDP Closing occurs following the Effective Time if (A) the gross
proceeds of such sale are less than the Minimum IDP Sale Price (as such term
is defined in paragraph (c) (B) of this Section 5.02), or (B) if the IDP
Closing occurs following the date which is 60 days after the Effective Time.
In such event, all CVRs shall automatically terminate, be cancelled and cease
to exist on the earlier to occur of (y) the IDP Closing Date (as to which the
gross proceeds of sale are less than the Minimum IDP Sale Price) or (z) the
date which is 60 days following the Effective Time, if no IDP Closing has
occurred prior to such date.

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

### (g) The CVRs will be uncertificated contract rights and will be non-
assignable and non-transferable by any holder thereof, except as required by
any applicable community property laws or laws of descent and distribution.
The holder of the CVR will not be entitled to any of the rights of a
stockholder in Parent or the Surviving Corporation (including, without
limitation, voting and dividend rights).

  

### 

  

### (h) The Company shall not intentionally delay a Closing of the Merger
pursuant to Article VII hereof in order to otherwise benefit (or have the
Company Stockholders otherwise benefit) from a IDP Sale or a IDP Closing
pursuant to this Section 5.02. Neither the Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall intentionally delay a IDP Closing of a IDP Sale in respect
of which a IDP Agreement has been executed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time and which would otherwise entitle the holder of
CVRs to any proceeds in respect thereof. For a period of 12 months following
the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries not to, enter into any IDP Agreement with
any prospective purchaser (or any of its affiliates) of the IDP Business if,
prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall have withheld its consent
pursuant to Section 5.02(b) to a IDP Sale with such prospective purchaser (or
its affiliates); provided that the terms of such IDP Agreement are on the
same or similar terms as the IDP Sale pursuant to which Purchaser withheld
its consent.

  

### 

  

### (i) All references in this Section 5.02 to the "Company" shall include
Subsidiaries of the Company.

  

### 

  

Section 5.03 _Litigation_. The Company shall notify Purchaser in
writing promptly after learning of any Legal Proceeding by or before any
court, arbitrator or arbitration panel, board or other Governmental Entity
initiated by it or against it, or known by it to be threatened against it or
any of its officers, directors, employees or stockholders in their capacity
as such that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

Section 5.04 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Purchaser shall give
reasonably prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall
give reasonably prompt notice to Purchaser, of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which
it becomes aware and would be likely to cause (x) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement applicable to it to be untrue or
inaccurate, in any material respect, or (y) any covenant, condition or
agreement contained in this Agreement applicable to it not to be complied
with or satisfied, in any material respect; and (ii) any failure or inability
of it to comply, in any material respect, with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Purchaser which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any statements which, in light of

material fact, or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate

expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined below), (ii) enter
into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with any person in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction, (iii)
agree to any Competing Transaction or (iv) endorse any Competing Transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger by the Company Stockholders, nothing in this Section 6.04 shall in
any respect prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company or the officers,
directors, agents, affiliates, employees or advisors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries from furnishing or disclosing information to, or engaging in
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an
unsolicited bona fide written proposal to acquire the Company pursuant to a
Competing Transaction (a " _Competing Transaction Proposal_ "), if the Board
of Directors of the Company acting in good faith determines after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor, such proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. A "
_Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any unsolicited, bona fide written
Competing Transaction Proposal made by a third person on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines, taking into consideration such
financial, legal, regulatory and other factors as they deem relevant, to be

### information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could be expected to
lead to a Competing Transaction Proposal and shall provide to Purchaser, in
writing, the terms and conditions of any such Competing Transaction Proposal,
or such request or inquiry and the identity of the person making the same.
Prior to the Company furnishing information with respect to the Company, as
permitted by Section 6.03(a) to any person making such a Competing
Transaction Proposal, the Company shall enter into a confidentiality
agreement with such person the terms of which are not materially less
restrictive than the Non-Disclosure Agreement, provided that all such
information (to the extent such information has not been provided
to Purchaser) is provided or made available to Purchaser at such time
such information is made available to such person.

  

### 

  

### (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser) or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser)
once made, its recommendation in favor of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to a Competing Transaction Proposal shall be considered
an adverse modification) or approve or recommend a Competing Transaction
Proposal (any action described in this subsection being referred to as a ("
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any
subsidiary thereof to execute, or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement or
other business combination or acquisition agreement, joint venture agreement

Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement related thereto).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may,
prior to the adoption and approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Company Stockholders, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with a Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consulting with its outside legal counsel) that the failure
of the Board of Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in connection with
a Superior Proposal until the second business day following Purchasers
receipt from the Company of (x) a notice that the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined that such Competing Transaction Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and that it intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (y) the terms and conditions of any offer or
proposal in respect to the Superior Proposal (it being understood that any
changes to the financial or material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice and two (2) day period). In determining whether to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement or the Merger proposed by Purchaser (in response to a
notice) in determining whether such proposal shall constitute a Superior
Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall be permitted to disclose to the stockholders of the Company a
position with respect to a Competing Transaction Proposal required by Rule
14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw,
modify or amend the recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Board of Directors of the Company or disclose any other information to the
Stockholders of the Company at any time if, in each case, it determines,
after consultation with its outside legal

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

### counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (e) A " _Competing Transaction_ " means any of the following involving
the Company (other than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer or other disposition of a material portion of the assets or debt or
equity securities of such party; and (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer

by the Company as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys
Certificate **** of Incorporation or Bylaws, employment agreements,
indemnification agreements identified on the Company Disclosure Schedule or
under applicable Law for acts or omissions which occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby). The Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement and exculpation that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those provisions
contained in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect
on the date hereof, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (unless such modification is required by
applicable Law).

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation, and in the event the Surviving Corporation fails to do
so, Parent, shall without any lapse in coverage provide to the past and
present officers and directors of the Company directors and officers
liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time covering each past and present officer and director of
the Company who is covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy (a true and complete copy of which has been
delivered to Purchaser). The terms and coverage amounts of the directors and
officers liability insurance policy to be so provided shall be at least as
favorable as the terms and coverage amounts of the liability insurance
policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation or Parent be required to expend annual
premiums of more than 200% of the current aggregate annual premium expended
by the Company (such 200% being the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or
procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation and Parent are unable to obtain
the insurance called for by this Section 6.05 without exceeding the Insurance
Amount, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that officers and directors of the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide any information reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporations insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

### insurance; and, _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation
and Parent reserve the right to substitute insurance carriers or insurance
coverage as long as the substituted insurance coverage, which shall be
provided without any lapse in coverage is at least as favorable to the past
and present officers and directors as the terms and coverage amounts of the
liability insurance policy in effect on the date hereof and so long as any
such substitute insurance carriers have an AM Best Insurance/credit rating
equal to or better than the AM Best insurance/credit rating for the existing
Companys insurance carriers.

  

### 

  

### (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 6.05 and
not in limitation thereof, for six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation each shall jointly and severally and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law indemnify and hold harmless,
the Indemnified Parties against all losses, claims, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action suit or
proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based
on, or arising out of or relating to the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or arising
out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, an " _Indemnifiable Claim_ "); _provided_ , that neither the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be responsible for any amounts paid in
settlement of any Indemnifiable Claim without the consent of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance all
reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party in connection with an
Indemnifiable Claim (including the cost of any investigation and the
preparation incurred in connection therewith) within 10 days after receipt by
it of a statement or statements from such Indemnified Party requesting such
advance or advances from time to time, provided that prior thereto the
Indemnified Party provides to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination shall have become final and non-appealable)
that such person is not entitled to indemnification from the Surviving
Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

  

### 

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.05 are intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, all past and present officers and directors of
the Company and his or her heirs and representatives. The rights of all
past and present officers and directors of the Company under this Section
6.05 **** are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract,
applicable Law or otherwise.

including those required under the HSR Act, **** and (iii) make all
necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submission,

contemplated by this Agreement required under applicable Law. The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all

nonfiling party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, by
accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith.

  

### 

  

### (b) Purchaser and the Company shall file as soon as practicable after the
date hereof (and in any event within ten Business Days) notifications under
the HSR Act and any similar filings required by any other applicable
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation and each
of Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to all reasonable inquiries or requests
and to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "
_Anticompetition Laws_ "). Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing
fees arising from the filings under the HSR Act contemplated by this Section
6.06(b).

  

### 

  

### (c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company and Purchaser shall
promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of
such party, threatened action, proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Entity in respect of any Anticompetition Laws.

each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements (other than
routine employee communications) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may in its good faith judgment
conclude may be required by Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system, in which case the issuing party shall use all
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such
release or making any such public statement; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Company will not disclose any information about Purchasers financing

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

sources, except as required by Law.  The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_.

  



  

Section 6.08 _Resignation of Directors_. As of the Effective Time, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
directors, and, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the directors
of each of its Subsidiaries, to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his
or her resignation as a director immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Commitment Letters (as such term is defined in the Second Escrow Agreement)
which, in the aggregate, provide for financing equal to the Remaining Amount;

Commitment Letter shall be deemed to be the lesser of (i) the

which, based on the terms of such commitment, can be borrowed in cash at the
Closing Date to finance the consummation of the Merger (in each case, net of
any upfront fees or other costs to be retained or charged by or to be

provided, however, that (i) Section 6.03(b), this Section 8.02, Section 8.04,
Section 6.05 and Article IX shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the
intentional breach of any of its representations or warranties or
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to applicable Law, waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein.  Any such

pay to Purchaser $15,000,000 in immediately available funds. If the Company
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or Section
8.01(i), then within seven days following the date of termination, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Company $40,000,000 in immediately available
funds.  If Purchaser shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), then within seven days following the date of termination,
the Company shall reimburse Purchaser for all of its reasonable and actual

professionals (including its bankers, outside legal counsel and accountants)
and reasonable actual travel expenses for its staff and its outside
professionals (including its bankers, outside legal counsel and accountants)
to conduct due diligence and to draft and negotiate this Agreement;
_provided_ , that such expenses shall not exceed $10,000,000. Purchaser and
the Company agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.04 are
an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.  Accordingly, if any party
fails to pay to the other party any amounts due under this Section 8.04, it
shall pay the cash and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit of other
legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on such

Section 9.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit_. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any attempt to do
so will be void; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser may assign this Agreement
to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser without the prior written
consent of the Company by having such assignee execute and deliver a
counterpart signature page hereto acknowledging its obligations hereunder as
a party to this Agreement and as a constituent; provided, further, however
that (a) at the time of and as a condition to any such assignment Parent and
Purchaser guarantee the obligations hereunder of such assignee in a manner
reasonably acceptable to the Company and (b) such assignment (i) is
permissible under the DGCL and (ii) does not delay or adversely affect the
consummation of the Merger. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Other than under Section 6.05,
nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any
person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.06 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of the Companys Board of Directors and the
Parents or Purchasers respective Board of Governors at any time prior
to the Effective Time whether before or after stockholder approval;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that after stockholder approval no amendment shall
be made which by Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of the
Company without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 9.07 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Schedules and all Exhibits attached
hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part
hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  



  

Section 9.08 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to
any other remedy at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Governing Law; Forum_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that state and
without regard to any applicable conflicts of law. The parties agree to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of Delaware with respect to
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any
rights under this Agreement.

reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all parties and their attorneys and
shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and intentions of all
parties hereto.

  

### 

  

### (c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather

### 

  

### (d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Appendixes," "Articles," "Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended
to refer to an Appendix, Article or Section of, or Schedule or Exhibit to,
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Except as otherwise indicated, all references (i) to any agreement
(including this Agreement), contract or Law are to such agreement, contract

(ii) to any Governmental Entity include any successor to that Governmental
Entity.

  

### 

  

Section 9.11 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall execute and cause
to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other
documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party
may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose
of carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts,
each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, the
Schedules, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule) and the Non-Disclosure Agreement constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect thereto.
No addition to or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be
binding upon any party hereto unless made in writing and signed by all
parties hereto.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Obligation of Parent_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, whenever this Agreement requires Purchaser or
Surviving Corporation to take any

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Parent to cause Purchaser or Surviving Corporation to take
such action and a guarantee of performance thereof.

  



  

 _[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]_

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF,** each of Parent, Purchaser, and the Company has
executed or has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly
authorized officer as of the date first written above.
