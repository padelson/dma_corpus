Agreement     -vi-   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   This
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "AGREEMENT") is made and entered
into as of January 16, 2002 among Western Multiplex Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("WESTERN MULTIPLEX"), Walnut-Pine Merger Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Western
Multiplex ("MERGER SUB"), and Proxim, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Proxim").   RECITALS   A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DELAWARE LAW"), Western Multiplex and Proxim will enter into a business
combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
Proxim (the "MERGER").   B. The Board of Directors of Western Multiplex (i)
has determined that the Merger is advisable, consistent with and in
furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Western Multiplex and fair
to, and in the best interests of, Western Multiplex and its stockholders,
(ii) has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) has approved and determined to
recommend that the stockholders of Western Multiplex vote to approve the
issuance of shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock (as defined below) to
the stockholders of Proxim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the
"SHARE Issuance").   C. The Board of Directors of Proxim (i) has determined
that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term
business strategy of Proxim and fair to, and in the best interests of, Proxim
and its stockholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and declared this Agreement
advisable and (iii) has determined to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement to the stockholders of Proxim.   D. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to Western
Multiplex\'s and Proxim\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
affiliates of Western Multiplex are entering into voting agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "WESTERN MULTIPLEX
VOTING AGREEMENTS"), and certain affiliates of Proxim are entering into
voting agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"PROXIM VOTING AGREEMENTS" and, collectively with the Western
Multiplex Voting Agreements, the "VOTING AGREEMENTS").   E. Concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to
Proxim\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, WMC Holding L.L.C. and
GTI Acquisition Corporation are entering into an Amended and
Restated Stockholders\' Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C (the "AMENDED STOCKHOLDERS\' AGREEMENT"), such agreement to be
effective upon consummation of the Merger.    F. For United States federal
income tax purposes, the parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to
adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Proxim, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and Proxim shall continue as the surviving
corporation. Proxim as the surviving corporation after the Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."   1.2
Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of Delaware Law (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the
parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "EFFECTIVE
TIME") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as herein
defined). The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the
offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation,
located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in
writing (the "CLOSING DATE").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Proxim and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Proxim
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
D.   1.5 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Merger Sub, Proxim or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:    -2-   (a) Conversion
of Proxim Common Stock. Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of Proxim (the "PROXIM COMMON STOCK"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Proxim
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.23), together with any
associated Proxim Rights (as defined in Section 2.23) under the Proxim Rights
Agreement (as defined in Section 2.23), will be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.5(e) and 1.5(f)) into
the right to receive 1.8896 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") shares of Class A common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Western Multiplex (the "WESTERN
MULTIPLEX COMMON STOCK") upon surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Proxim Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.6 (or in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required)) in the manner provided in Section
1.8).   (b) Cancellation of Treasury and Western Multiplex-Owned
Stock. Each share of Proxim Common Stock held in the treasury of Proxim or
owned by Merger Sub or Western Multiplex immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.  
(c) Stock Options. The parties shall take all requisite action such that, at
the Effective Time, all options to purchase Proxim Common Stock then
outstanding (the "PROXIM OPTIONS") under Proxim\'s 1986 Stock Option
Plan, 1994 Director Option Plan, 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 1999
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "PROXIM STOCK OPTION
PLANS") shall be assumed by Western Multiplex in accordance with Section 5.9
hereof. Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of Western
Multiplex shall take all necessary action to assume and adopt, as of the
Closing Date, Proxim\'s 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and shall have the
discretion to adopt, as of the Closing Date, any other Proxim Stock Option
Plan. Rights outstanding under Proxim\'s 1993 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.9 hereof.   (d) Capital Stock of
Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Western Multiplex Common Stock or
Proxim Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Western Multiplex Common Stock or Proxim Common
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.   (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Western Multiplex
Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof,
each holder of shares of Proxim    -3-  Common Stock who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a share of Western Multiplex Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall receive from Western Multiplex an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of
one share of Western Multiplex Common Stock for the five (5) most recent days
that Western Multiplex Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market System ("NASDAQ").   1.6 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange
Agent. Western Multiplex shall select an institution reasonably satisfactory
to Proxim to act as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the
Merger.   (b) Western Multiplex to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Western Multiplex shall make available to the Exchange
Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, (i) certificates for
the shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5
in exchange for outstanding shares of Proxim Common Stock, (ii) cash in an
amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.5(f) and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of
shares of Proxim Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(d).  
(c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Western Multiplex
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Proxim Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(f) and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 1.6(d), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Western Multiplex may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Western Multiplex
Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.5(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.6(d).
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Western Multiplex, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holders of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(a) (which, other than
for Proxim Affiliates shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by applicable law
rule or regulation), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.6(d), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith    -4-  be canceled. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time,
for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive, upon due
surrender thereof, the number of full shares of Western Multiplex Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5, cash in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.6(d).   (d) Distributions With
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Western Multiplex
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(f) will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of
Western Multiplex Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5, until such
Certificates shall have been duly surrendered. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent or any other
agent designated by Western Multiplex shall deliver to the holders thereof,
without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole
shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along
with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(f) and the
amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Western Multiplex Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock.   (e)
Transfers of Ownership. If certificates for shares of Western Multiplex
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Western Multiplex or any
agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holders of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Western Multiplex or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Required Withholding. Each of Western Multiplex, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any former holder of Proxim Common Stock such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.6, none of the Exchange Agent, Western
Multiplex, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock or Proxim Common Stock
for    -5-  any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.7 No Further
Ownership Rights in Proxim Common Stock. All shares of Western Multiplex
Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.5(f) and 1.6(d)) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Proxim Common Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Proxim Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.8 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, such shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock, cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.5(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.6(d); provided,
however, that Western Multiplex may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Western
Multiplex, Proxim or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates

regulations (foreign or domestic), including ERISA and the Code, that are
applicable to such Proxim Plans. No suit, action or other litigation
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Proxim Plan

against or with respect to any such Proxim Plan. There are no audits,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Proxim, threatened

"DOL") with respect to any Proxim Plans. All contributions, reserves or
premium payments required to be made or accrued as of the date hereof to the
Proxim Plans have been timely made or accrued. Section 2.12(b) of the Proxim
Disclosure Letter includes a listing of the accrued vacation liability of
Proxim as of January 3, 2002. Any Proxim Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section

time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has been amended to
incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986
and subsequent legislation. Proxim does not have any plan or commitment to
establish any new Proxim Plan, to modify any Proxim Plan (except to
the extent required by law or to conform any such Proxim Plan to the
requirements of any applicable law, in each case as previously disclosed to
Western Multiplex in writing, or as required by this Agreement), or to enter
into any new Proxim Plan. Each Proxim Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms,
without liability to Western Multiplex, Proxim or any of its Affiliates
(other than ordinary administration expenses).   (c) Neither Proxim, any of
its subsidiaries, nor any of their Affiliates has at any time ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to any
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and at no time
has Proxim contributed to or been requested to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in ERISA. Neither Proxim nor
any Affiliate has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in or contributed to any multiple employer plan, or to any plan
described in Section 413 of the Code. Neither Proxim, any of
its subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of Proxim or any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any liability or penalty under Section 4975
through 4980B of the Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction,"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of
ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 408
of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Proxim Plan.   (d) Neither
Proxim, any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their Affiliates has, before the
Effective Time and in any material respect, violated any of the health
continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, as amended, the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act of
1993, as amended, or any similar provisions of state law applicable to Proxim
employees. None of the Proxim Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable

or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such
retiree benefits to any employee, former employee, director, consultant or
other person, except to the extent required by statute.   (e) Neither
Proxim nor any of its subsidiaries is bound by or subject to (and none of its
respective assets or properties is bound by or subject to) any arrangement
with any labor union. No employee of Proxim or any of its subsidiaries is
represented by any labor union or covered by any collective bargaining
agreement and, to the Knowledge of Proxim, no campaign to establish such
representation is in progress. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Proxim, threatened labor dispute involving Proxim or any of its subsidiaries
and any group of its employees nor has Proxim or any of its subsidiaries
experienced any labor interruptions over the past three (3) years, and Proxim
and its subsidiaries consider their relationships with their employees to be
good. Proxim (i) is in compliance in all respects with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, in each case, with respect to its current or
former employees; (ii) has withheld and    -17-  reported all amounts
required by law or by agreement to be withheld and reported with respect to
wages, salaries and other payments to its current or former employees; (iii)

failure to comply with any of the foregoing; and (iv) is not liable for any

of any governmental authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
its current and former employees (other than routine payments to be made in
the normal course of business and consistent with past practice). There are
no pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims or actions against
Proxim under any worker\'s compensation policy or long-term disability
policy.   (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) result in
any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, forgiveness of indebtedness, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to
any stockholder, director or employee of Proxim or any of its subsidiaries
under any Proxim Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Proxim Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.   (g) No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by Proxim or its Affiliates with respect to
any employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code
Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) will be characterized as a
"parachute payment," within the meaning of Code Section 280G(B)(2).   2.13

good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties, including the

any liens or encumbrances except as reflected in the Proxim Financials and
except for liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such imperfections

to the outstanding Proxim Rights thereunder.    -22-    ARTICLE III

any of the terms or conditions of any of the Western Multiplex Contracts in
such a manner as would permit any other party to cancel or terminate any such
Western Multiplex Contract, or would permit any other party to seek material
damages or other remedies (for any or all of such breaches, violations or
defaults, in the aggregate).   3.17 Title to Western Multiplex Properties.
Western Multiplex owns no real property nor has it ever owned any real
property. All current Western Multiplex leases, subleases or other occupancy
contracts or agreements and each amendment or other modification thereto
(the    -36-   "WESTERN MULTIPLEX LEASES") are in full force and effect
and are valid and enforceable. Western Multiplex is not in breach of or in
default under any of such current Western Multiplex Leases and no event or
condition has occurred which could (with the giving of notice or the passage
of time or both) constitute a breach of or default by Western Multiplex under
any such current Western Multiplex Lease. To Western Multiplex\'s Knowledge,
no other party to any such current Western Multiplex Lease is in breach of or
in default under any such current Western Multiplex Leases and no event or
condition has occurred which could (with the giving of notice or the passage
of time or both) constitute a breach of or default by Western Multiplex under
any such current Western Multiplex Lease. No party other than Western
Multiplex has the right to occupy any Western Multiplex real property
currently leased or otherwise occupied by Western Multiplex.   3.18
Statements; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. None of the information

time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the
date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to Western
Multiplex\'s stockholders and Proxim\'s stockholders, at the time of the
Western Multiplex Stockholders\' Meeting or the Proxim Stockholders\' Meeting
and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading, or omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Western Multiplex
Stockholders\' Meeting or the Proxim Stockholders\' Meeting which has become
false or misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time before the Effective Time,
any event relating to Western Multiplex or any of its affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Western Multiplex which should be set forth
in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Western Multiplex shall promptly inform Proxim.

warranty with respect to any information supplied by Proxim that is contained
in any of the foregoing documents.   3.19 Board Approval. The Board of

shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock entitled to vote, present in
person or proxy, on the Share Issuance is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of Western Multiplex\'s capital stock necessary to approve

Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of Western Multiplex has approved
this Agreement and the Western Multiplex Voting Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such approval is
sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby the restrictions contained in Section 203 of
the Delaware Law, to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise be
applicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

vote of its respective stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to

transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its material
subsidiaries, or any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the consolidated
assets (including without limitation stock of its subsidiaries) of such party
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender
or exchange offer for, the equity securities of such party that, if

Person) beneficially owning or acquiring securities representing 15% or more
of the total voting power of such party (or of the surviving parent entity in
such transaction) or any of its material subsidiaries.   (ii) "SUPERIOR
OFFER," with respect to a party, shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made by a third party on terms that the Board of
Directors of such party has in good faith concluded (after consultation with

offer and the Person making the offer, to be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to such party\'s stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the terms of the Merger and is reasonably capable of being
consummated, it being understood and agreed that the inclusion of a due
diligence condition in an Acquisition Proposal shall not in and of itself
preclude such Acquisition Proposal from being a Superior Offer for
the purposes of Section 5.3(c) hereof. For the purposes of this definition,
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 5.3(h)(i), except that references to "15%" therein shall be deemed

such properties or information. Any information provided pursuant to this
Section 5.4(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) No
Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants. No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification pursuant to this

exchanging such information and promptly provide the other with copies of all
filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral

Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.   (d) Reasonable Best

hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, including all Necessary Consents, (iv) the
defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings,

any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions

becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement
on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
(e) Limitation on Divestiture. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Western Multiplex or Proxim or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree
to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of
any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their

shall give prompt notice to Western Multiplex when and if Proxim becomes
aware that any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or that it has failed to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied.   (b) By

Benefits.   (a) Assumption of Stock Options. The parties hereto shall
take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Proxim Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time
and regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed by
Western Multiplex. Each Proxim Option so assumed by Western Multiplex under
this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Proxim Stock Option Plan (and any
applicable stock option agreement for such Proxim Option) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions), except that (i) each Proxim Option will be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of Western Multiplex Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Proxim Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Proxim Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Western
Multiplex Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares
of Western Multiplex Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Proxim Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Proxim Common Stock at which such Proxim
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Proxim
Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the
same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was
vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, Western Multiplex will issue to each
person who holds an assumed Proxim Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Proxim Option by Western Multiplex.   (b) Incentive
Stock Options. It is intended that Proxim Options assumed by Western
Multiplex shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock
options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent Proxim Options
qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall be applied consistent with such
intent.   (c) Proxim Purchase Plan. The parties hereto shall take
all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time, the Proxim Purchase
Plan shall be terminated. The rights of participants in the Proxim Purchase
Plan with respect to any offering period then underway under the Proxim
Purchase Plan shall be determined by treating the last business day prior to
the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Proxim Purchase Plan. Prior to the effective time, Proxim shall take all
actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Proxim Purchase
Plan) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions   
-53-   contemplated by this Section 5.9(c). Western Multiplex shall permit
Proxim employees to participate in the Western Multiplex Purchase Plan no
later than the later of ten (10) days and the beginning of the first complete
pay period following the Closing Date, and Western Multiplex shall take all

employees in the Western Multiplex Purchase Plan.   (d) Change of Control

registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Western Multiplex Common
Stock issuable with respect to assumed Proxim Options to the extent Form S-8

thereafter for so long as any of such options or other rights remain
outstanding.   5.11 Indemnification.   (a) Indemnity. From and after the
Effective Time, Western Multiplex will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Proxim
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Proxim and its directors
and officers immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES"), subject to applicable law. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees or agents of Proxim, unless such modification
is required by law.   (b) Insurance. For a period of six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained in
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by Proxim covering
those persons who are currently covered by Proxim\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable
to the current directors and officers of Proxim for a period of six (6)
years; provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual
premium currently paid by Proxim for such coverage (and to the extent annual
premium would exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium
currently paid by Proxim for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such two hundred
percent (200%) of such annual premium).    -54-    (c) Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Section 5.11 is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns. In the event the Surviving Corporation or its
successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation
honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

the Code.   5.16 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of each of Western Multiplex and Proxim shall adopt a
