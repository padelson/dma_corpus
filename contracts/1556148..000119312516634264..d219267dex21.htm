16 (b) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Option shall be cancelled without
consideration and shall be of no further force and effect.

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Restricted Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled,
and in consideration of such cancellation, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to pay as promptly as practicable to
such holder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Restricted Stock and (ii) the applicable Per Share Restricted Stock
Price (the aggregate of such amounts for all shares of Restricted Stock, the "
_Restricted Stock Payment Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such cash
payment will not be made (and shall not be taken into account as Restricted
Stock Payment Amount) to shares of Restricted Stock that were purchased with a
Recourse Promissory Note;  _provided further_ , that the consideration for
the cancellation of Restricted Stock purchased with a Recourse Promissory Note
shall be the cancellation of a portion of the aggregate indebtedness of such
Recourse Promissory Note that underlies such Restricted Stock. For clarity,
shares of Restricted Stock that are subject to accelerated vesting and the
lapse of the Companys repurchase right effective as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be subject to the treatment described in Section
2.7(a) above and will not be deemed to be Restricted Stock as of the Effective
Time for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Payment for Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Company shall appoint
Wilmington Trust, N.A. (or another paying agent to be agreed to by Buyer and
the Company prior to the Closing) to act as paying agent in connection with
the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") pursuant to a paying agent agreement
providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this Section 2.10
and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the parties. At or before the
Closing, the Buyer shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
Stockholders, cash in an amount equal to (i) the Estimated Cash
Merger Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the Dissenting Shares Amount, _minus_
(iii) the Option Payment Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the
Paying Agent;  _provided_ , that the Buyer shall thereafter promptly deposit
with the Paying Agent any portion of the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration
that may become due with respect to Stock that is no longer Dissenting Shares
as specified in Section 2.8. Such funds shall be invested as directed by
Buyer and the Seller Representative, pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the Stockholders. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, and no part thereof shall accrue to the benefit of Stockholders.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (but in no event later than
two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced
outstanding Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Stock were converted with
the right to receive the consideration described in Section 2.7(a) and Section
2.7(b), (i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached as
_Exhibit H_ hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment
therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying

 



17  Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (as
promptly as practicable but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days
after the applicable holder of a Certificate satisfies the obligations
described in the preceding sentence), an amount in cash equal to (A) the
applicable Per Share Cash Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number
of shares of the Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, without
interest, and such Certificate shall, upon such surrender, be cancelled. Each
such holder shall also be entitled to any amounts that may be payable
in respect of the Stock formerly represented by such Certificate from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein. If payment in respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the
signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly
guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Buyer and the Paying Agent that any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.10,
any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares or
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto, without interest, as contemplated herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Stockholder delivers to the Paying Agent
at least two Business Days before the Closing a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal together with the Certificate, the Buyer shall cause such
Stockholders Letter of Transmittal and Certificate to be reviewed and
processed prior to the Effective Time, such that, so long as such Person
continues to hold the shares of Stock represented by such Certificate as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Person will be paid the
payments described in Section 2.7(a) and Section 2.7(b), as applicable, with
respect to such Certificate on the Closing Date, by check or by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any
shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, a Certificate (other than one representing Cancelled
Shares) is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.10.

(d) All cash paid upon conversion of the Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Article II (including the cash payable upon release of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund), all cash paid pursuant to Section 2.11 and all cash deposited
with the Company pursuant to this Article II and further distributed by the
Company pursuant to the terms of this Article II, shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the Stock represented thereby, except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of

 



18  the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.10(b) for the Stock represented thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in their reasonable
discretion, require the delivery of a satisfactory indemnity.

(f) At any time following the date that is fifteen (15) months after the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other income received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, or any Certificates or
other documents relating to the Merger in its possession, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Buyer only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any portion of the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without interest; _provided_
, that any such portion of the Merger Consideration payable from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed to the Person(s) entitled thereto
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at
the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.10, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Paying Agent, the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than the Surviving Corporations first payroll following the Closing),
the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall, in exchange for
the Vested Options, make the payment in respect of each such Option to which
each holder thereof is entitled as specified in Section 2.9(a) in accordance
with Section 6.8(c).

(h) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall, in exchange for the shares of
Restricted Stock (other than shares of Restricted Stock that were purchased
with a Recourse Promissory Note), make the payment in respect of each such
share of Restricted Stock to which each holder thereof is entitled as
specified in Section 2.9(c).

 

(i) All payments to be made under this Section 2.10 shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
holder of the Stock, except as otherwise agreed by the payor and payee. Wire
transfer instructions shall be provided to the Surviving Corporation at least
two Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

 

Section 2.11 _____Other Closing Payments ___ __.

 

(a) As part of the Merger Consideration, concurrently with the Closing

 

(i) the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Indemnity Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Fund;

(ii) the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered on behalf of the Company
the amount payable to each counterparty or holder of Indebtedness identified
on _Schedule 2.11(a)(ii)_ (the " _Payoff Indebtedness_ ") in order to fully
discharge such Payoff Indebtedness and terminate all applicable obligations
and liabilities of the Company and any of its Affiliates related thereto, as
specified in the Debt Payoff Letters and in accordance with this Agreement;

 



19 (iii) the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiaries, the Option Payment Amount and
shall instruct the Surviving Corporation and/or its applicable Subsidiaries to
distribute the Option Payment Amount as promptly as possible (and in any event
no later than the day that is the first payroll of the Surviving Corporation
or such Subsidiary following the Closing) pursuant to Section 2.9 in
accordance with Section 6.8(c);

 

(iv) the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered on behalf of the Company
the amount payable to each Person who is owed a portion of the Estimated

Seller Representative, the Seller Representative Reserve, in accordance with
Section 2.16.

All payments hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in United States dollars to such account as may be designated to the
payor by the payee at least two Business Days prior to the applicable payment
date.

 

Section 2.12 _Closing Estimates_. At least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver
to the Buyer a written statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ")
that shall include and set forth (i) a good-faith estimate of (A) Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ ") and (D) all
Transaction Expenses that are accrued or due and remain unpaid (the "
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of Estimated Net Working
Capital, Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction
Expenses determined as of the Determination Time and, except for Estimated
Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein) and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated
Cash Merger Consideration. Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness and Estimated Cash shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Balance Sheet (
_provided_ , that in the event of a conflict between GAAP and consistent
application thereof, GAAP shall prevail), subject to such differences in
accounting principles, policies and procedures as are set forth on _Schedule
2.12_ (GAAP as so modified pursuant to _Schedule 2.12_, the " _Applicable
Accounting Principles_ "). All calculations of Estimated Net Working Capital,
Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses
shall be accompanied by a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the
Company certifying that such estimates have been calculated in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement. All such estimates shall control solely for
purposes of determining the amounts payable at the Closing pursuant to Section
2.10(a) and Section 2.11 and shall not limit or otherwise affect the Buyers
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise or constitute an acknowledgement by
the Buyer of the accuracy of the amounts reflected thereof.

 



20 Section 2.13 _Post-Closing Adjustment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller Representative
(on behalf of the Stockholders) a written statement (the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth (i) a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the Determination Time (the
" _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a calculation of the actual (A) Net
Working Capital (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness (the
" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash (the " _Closing Cash_ "), and (D)
Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses determined as of the Determination Time and, except for
Closing Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein). Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Cash shall be calculated in accordance with the Applicable Accounting
Principles. The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (1) afford the
Seller Representative (including its legal advisors and accountants) access to
the Surviving Corporations books and records as and to the extent reasonably
necessary for the Seller Representative to confirm the accuracy of the Final
Closing Statement, (2) make available to the Seller Representative any
employee of the Surviving Corporation or Buyer who was materially involved in
the preparation the Final Closing Statement, and (3) provide the Seller
Representative with any other documentation or information reasonably
requested to confirm the Final Closing Statement.

 

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 45th day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the
Seller Representative delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement
(a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and amount of any
dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement. The Seller Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all
items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses not specifically referenced
in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject
to review in accordance with Section 2.13(c).

 

(c) During the 15 day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Seller Representative to the Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), the
parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any differences that
they may have with respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in
writing between the Seller Representative and the Buyer within the Resolution
Period shall be final and binding with respect to such items, and if the
Seller Representative and the Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of
each disputed item specified by the Seller Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so
determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. If the Seller Representative and the Buyer have not resolved all
such differences by the end of the Resolution Period, the Seller
Representative and the Buyer shall submit, in writing, to a mutually agreed
upon public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), their
briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each item
remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each such
disputed 

 



21  item and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts in the Seller Representatives and the Buyers respective calculations
of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Closing Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to
which the Seller Representative and the Buyer have been unable to agree. The
Independent Accounting Firms services and authority to make a determination
shall be limited in scope to the disputed issues, and the Independent
Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte LLP or, if such firm is unable
or unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting firm as shall
be agreed in writing by the Seller Representative and the Buyer or, if the
parties are unable to agree within five (5) Business Days from the end of the
Resolution Period, then the Independent Accounting Firm shall be an
internationally recognized independent public accounting firm and shall be
selected by a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Seller
Representative and Buyer. In the event that, within 30 days after the end of
the Resolution Period, the Seller Representative and Buyer cannot mutually
agree on one arbitrator, then the parties shall arrange for the American
Arbitration Association to designate a single arbitrator in accordance with
the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Seller Representative
and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 days
following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will
be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section
2.13(c), including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) and the Buyer in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.
All other fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each party incurred
in connection with the preparation or review of the Final Closing Statement
and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall
be borne by such party.

(e) The Buyer and the Seller Representative will, and will cause the Company
(in the case of the Seller Representative, prior to the Closing and, in the
case of the Buyer, during the period from and after the date of delivery of
the Final Closing Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration contemplated by this Section 2.13) to
afford the other party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, and its Subsidiaries and to any other information reasonably
requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations 

 



22  contemplated by this Section 2.13. Each party shall authorize its
accountants to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in
connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations of the Net Working
Capital, Cash and Indebtedness as specified in this Section 2.13; _provided_ ,
that such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants disclosure procedures and then
only after the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to access to
such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

 

(f) Following the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to
Section 2.13, the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration shall be recalculated
by (A) substituting either (x) the Working Capital Overage with the Closing
Working Capital Overage as determined pursuant to Section 2.13 or (y) the
Working Capital Underage with the Closing Working Capital Underage pursuant
to Section 2.13, (B) substituting the Estimated Indebtedness with the Closing
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.13, (C)
substituting the Estimated Cash with the Closing Cash as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.13 and (D) substituting the Estimated Transaction
Expenses with the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.13 (collectively, the " _Net Adjustment_ " and the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration as recalculated pursuant to the preceding
clauses (A) through (D), the " _Final Cash Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(g) If after taking into consideration the Net Adjustment, the Final Cash
Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration
(the " _Positive Net Adjustment Amount_ "), the Buyer shall promptly (but in
any event within five Business Days of final determination of the Net
Adjustment Amount) pay the Positive Net Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to (1) the Paying Agent for delivery to the
Stockholders (other than holders of any Dissenting Shares) and (2) the
Surviving Corporation and/or its applicable Subsidiaries for delivery to
holders of the Vested Options in accordance with Section 6.8(c). Payment of
such amounts to the Holders shall be made in accordance with their Pro Rata
Portions.

 

(h) If after taking into consideration the Net Adjustment, the Estimated Cash
Merger Consideration is greater than the Final Cash Merger Consideration (the
" _Negative Net Adjustment Amount_ "), the Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall execute and deliver mutual written notice to the Escrow Agent specifying
the Negative Net Adjustment Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall pay the
Negative Net Adjustment Amount (such value shall be deemed to be equal to the
absolute value of such amount) out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Buyer
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnity
Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount payable to the Buyer
pursuant hereto, the deficiency shall be recovered from the Holders severally
but not jointly and based on their Pro Rata Portion subject to the Aggregate
Cap.

 

Section 2.14 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable
tax Law (including amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the Seller Representative Reserve, the Net Adjustment Amount or the
Indemnity Escrow Fund,

 



23  consistent with Section 6.8). To the extent that such amounts are so
appropriately withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law by the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding
was made. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
reduce any such withholding, including obtaining, or causing another party to
obtain, IRS Forms W-8 and/or W-9 from the recipients of such payments.

 

Section 2.15 _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the DGCL, the Stockholder
Consent and the Letters of Transmittal, the Holders irrevocably appoint and
constitute Fortis Advisors LLC as exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, to act on behalf of the Holders for certain
limited purposes, as the Seller Representative, including the full power
and authority to act on the Holders behalf as provided in Section 2.15(b).
The Holders, by approving this Agreement, further agree that the powers,
immunities and right to indemnification granted to the Seller Representative
Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Seller Representative, except as provided in
Section 2.15(c), and shall be binding upon the successors, heirs, executors,
administers and legal representatives of each Holder and shall not be
affected by, and shall survive, the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution
or liquidation of any Holder, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Seller Representative shall be binding upon each Holder
and such Holders successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Holder, and no Holder shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest any such decision, action, consent
or instruction. The Buyer and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on any
decision, action, consent or instruction of the Seller Representative as
being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the Holders, and the
Buyer and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or
instruction. The Seller Representative shall be entitled to: (A) rely upon the
Pro Rata Portions provided to Seller Representative, (B) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (C) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Holder
or other party.

(b) The Seller Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller Representative
shall have full power, authority and discretion to (i) consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(including pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof); (ii) negotiate disputes arising
under, or relating to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including
pursuant to Section 2.13 and Article VIII hereof); (iii) withhold any amounts
received on behalf of the Holders under this Agreement or otherwise to satisfy
any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by the Holders or the Seller
Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder (including
pursuant to Section 2.13, Section 2.14 and Article VIII hereof); and (iv)
following the Closing Date execute and deliver, on behalf of the Holders, any
amendment or waiver to this

 



24  Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (without the prior approval of the
Holders) that the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, provided that such amendment does not require approval of the
Stockholders pursuant to applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Seller Representative shall have no authority to resolve
any claim that is made by a Buyer Indemnitee against a particular Holder for
such Holders fraud (made with intent to deceive). The Seller Representative
shall have full power and authority to take any action (or refrain from doing
any further act or deed) by or on behalf of the Holders which the Seller
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion in
connection with this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 2.13 and Article
VIII hereof) and the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller Representative shall
have no duties or obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties,
except those set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and such duties and
obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Seller Representative in any other schedule, exhibit or the
Disclosure Schedules.

 

(c) The Seller Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Holders holding a
majority of the Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the
event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the Seller
Representative, a new Seller Representative shall be appointed by the vote
or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of
the written consent appointing such new Seller Representative shall be sent to
the Buyer and, after the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that until such notice is received, the Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to rely on the
decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the prior Seller
Representative as described in Section 2.15(a). The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Seller
Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(d) Certain Holders have entered into an engagement agreement with the Seller
Representative to provide direction to the Seller Representative in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Seller Representative engagement agreement (such Holders, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "
_Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Seller Representative nor its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any
member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Seller
Representative Group_ "), shall be liable to any Holder for any action or
failure to act in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Seller Representatives responsibilities hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement
or under any Seller Representative engagement agreement, unless and only to
the extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

 

(e) The Seller Representative shall be entitled to recover any Seller
Representative Expenses it may incur in performing its duties or exercising
its rights under this Agreement: (i) first by recourse to the Seller
Representative Reserve paid to Seller Representative under Section 2.16 of
this Agreement, (ii) second by recourse from any distribution of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Holders in the event
such expenses exceed the Seller Representative Reserve, and (iii) third by
recourse directly to

 



25  the Holders based on their respective Pro Rata Portions in the event such
expenses exceed the Seller Representative Reserve; _provided_ , _however_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term in this Agreement, in no
event shall any Holder be liable for any obligations of the Seller
Representative in an amount in excess of the aggregate proceeds received by
such Holder (before withholding) pursuant to Article II of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than the
payment of the Seller Representative Reserve to the Seller Representative
under Section 2.16 hereof, neither the Buyer nor the Company nor its
Subsidiaries shall have any monetary obligation or liability to the Seller
Representative. The Holders acknowledge that the Seller Representative shall
not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Seller Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Seller Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities
which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the Seller
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Seller Representative in performing such actions.

(f) By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the DGCL, the Stockholder
Consent, and the Letters of Transmittal, the Holders hereby, severally but
not jointly, based on their respective Pro Rata Portions, agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Seller Representative Group from and against any
and all losses, liabilities claims, damages, fees, costs or expenses
(including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement incurred on the part of
the Seller Representative (except for those arising out of the Seller
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct) (collectively, the "
_Seller Representative Expenses_ ").

 

Section 2.16 _Seller Representative Reserve_. On the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Seller
Representative cash in the amount of the Seller Representative Reserve;
_provided_ , that the Seller Representative shall provide wire transfer
instructions to the Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the Closing

willful misconduct. For Tax purposes, the Seller Representative Reserve shall
be treated as set forth in Section 6.8(a). Subject to Advisory
Group approval, the Seller Representative may contribute funds to the Seller
Representative Reserve from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Holders. Any portion of the Seller Representative Reserve that remains
undeliverable or unclaimed after six (6) months of the initial delivery
attempt shall promptly be paid to Buyer and handled in the same manner as
other unclaimed funds as provided in this Agreement. Upon the determination of
the Seller Representative that the Seller Representative Reserve is no longer
necessary in connection with defending claims for indemnification and other
post-Closing matters pursuant to Section 2.15, the Seller Representative shall
distribute to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Holders
(solely out of the Seller Representative Reserve), the amount remaining in the
Seller Representative Reserve after payment of all of the Seller
Representative Expenses incurred in connection with its services as
Seller Representative, in accordance with each Holders Pro Rata Portion. The
Seller Representative Reserve shall not be available to the Buyer to satisfy
any claims hereunder. Any payments as may be required by the Seller
Representative to be made directly to it by any Holder pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement shall be paid in accordance with such
Holders Pro Rata Portion.

reflected on the Balance Sheet or acquired in the ordinary course of business
since the date of the Balance Sheet, except those sold or otherwise disposed
of for fair value since the date of the Balance Sheet in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice. The physical assets owned or
leased by the Company and its Subsidiaries constitute in all material respects
all of the physical assets necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
carry on their respective businesses as currently conducted. None of the
assets owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any Encumbrance, other than (i) liens for Taxes not yet past due and for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP, (ii)
mechanics, workmens, repairmens, warehousemens and carriers liens arising
in the ordinary course of business of the Company or such Subsidiary
consistent with past practice and (iii) any such matters of record,
Encumbrances and other imperfections of title that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially impair the continued ownership, use and operation of
the assets to which they relate in the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted (collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_
").

(b) To the knowledge of the Company, all material tangible assets owned or
leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries have been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with generally accepted industry practice, are in all
material respects in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and are adequate for the uses to which they are being put.

This Section 3.12 does not relate to real property or interests in real
property, such items being the subject of Section 3.13, or to Intellectual
Property, such items being the subject of Section 3.14.

 

Section 3.13 _Real Property_. _Schedule 3.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules
sets forth a true and complete list of all Leased Real Property. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable leasehold title to all
Leased Real Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances except Permitted
Encumbrances in the manner the Company currently operates. All leases of
Leased Real Property and all amendments and modifications thereto are in full
force and effect, and there exists no default under any such lease by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other party thereto, nor any event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default thereunder by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any other party thereto. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.13(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, all leases of Leased Real Property
shall remain valid and binding in accordance with their terms following the
Closing. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real
property.

 



37 Section 3.14 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Schedule 3.14(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of all (i) registered or material unregistered Marks, issued
Patents and registered Copyrights, including any pending applications to
register any of the foregoing and (ii) material Software, in each case owned
(in whole or in part) by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and used or held for use in the Companys and its Subsidiaries
businesses, identifying for each whether it is owned by or exclusively
licensed to the Company or the relevant Subsidiary (" _Company Owned IP_ ").
The Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive beneficial
and, with respect to applications and registrations (including Patents),
record owner of all the Company Owned IP.

 

(b) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.14(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, the
use of any Open Source Materials by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) is permissible, (ii) does not infringe upon the rights of any Person,
(iii) does not violate the applicable license with respect to such Open Source
Materials and (iv) does not obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to (A) distribute or disclose in source code form any other Software combined
or distributed with such Open Source Materials or (B) license or otherwise
make available on a royalty-free basis any such other Software that is
combined or distributed with such Open Source Materials.

(c) The Company or its Subsidiaries exclusively own or have a valid right
to use, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances (other than Permitted

or held for use in the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses, other than
Intellectual Property that is licensed to the Company by a third-party
licensor pursuant to a written license agreement that remains in effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or
claim challenging the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ownership (in
whole or in part) of any Intellectual Property, nor to the knowledge of the
Company, is there a reasonable basis for any such claim.

 

(d) All Company Owned IP is valid, subsisting and to the knowledge of the
Company enforceable, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any
Company Owned IP or alleging any misuse of such Company Owned IP. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the
abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of the Company Owned IP listed on _Schedule 3.14(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules (including the failure to pay any filing, examination,
issuance, post registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like and
the failure to disclose any known material prior art in connection with the
prosecution of patent applications). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any Person any right to control the prosecution or
registration of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to commence, defend or otherwise control any claim with
respect to such Intellectual Property.

(e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable
steps in accordance with standard industry practices to protect its rights in
Company Owned IP and at all times has maintained the confidentiality of all
information that constitutes or

 



38  constituted a Trade Secret of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including requiring all third parties having access thereto to execute written
non-disclosure agreements. There has not been any disclosure of any Trade
Secret of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any such
information of any other Person disclosed in confidence to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) to any Person in a manner that has resulted in the loss
of Trade Secrets or other rights in and to such information. All current and
former employees, officers, consultants and contractors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have executed and delivered proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the Companys
standard forms, and no current or former employee or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has excluded works or inventions from his or her
assignment of inventions.

 

(f) The development, manufacture, sale, distribution or other commercial
exploitation of products, the provision of any services by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have not infringed upon,
misappropriated, constituted the unauthorized use of or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property rights of any Person, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim asserting, suggesting or
threatening (including in the form of offers or invitations to obtain a
license) that any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution, unauthorized
use or other violation is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred,
nor to the knowledge of the Company, is there a reasonable basis therefor. No
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to, or used or held for use in the
businesses of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation, writ or agreement
restricting the use or licensing thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries.
To the knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting, using without authorization or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property owned by or exclusively licensed to, or used or held for use in the
businesses of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no such claim has
been asserted or threatened by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against
any Person. This clause (f) contains the only representations and warranties
of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the absence of infringement
or misappropriation by any of them of the Intellectual Property of any third
party.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred ownership
of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, or option to purchase,
any material Intellectual Property used or held for use in the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries businesses.

 

(h) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not give rise to any right of any Person to
terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries rights or obligations under any agreement under which any
right or license of or under Intellectual Property is granted to or by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(i) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns, or has rights to access and
use or hold for use, all electronic data processing, information, record
keeping, communications, telecommunications, account management, inventory
management and other computer systems (including data, databases and
hardware) and related content (collectively, the " _IT Systems_ ") used to
process, store, maintain and operate data, information and functions used in
connection with the operation of their businesses as presently conducted,
including systems to operate

 



39  payroll, accounting, billing and receivables, payables, inventory, asset
tracking, customer service and human resources functions. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps in accordance with
industry standards to secure the IT Systems from unauthorized access or use by
any Person, and to ensure the continued, uninterrupted and error-free
operation of the IT Systems. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) there have
been no material security breaches in the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries IT Systems, and (ii) there have been no disruptions in the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries IT Systems that materially adversely
affected the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries businesses or operations.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have evaluated their disaster recovery and
backup needs and have implemented plans and systems that are designed
to reasonably address their assessment of risk.

(j) The IT Systems are adequate for the operation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently operated, and are in good working
condition (normal wear and tear excepted). To the knowledge of the Company,
the IT Systems and Software are free of all viruses, worms, Trojan horses and
other known contaminants and do not contain any bugs, errors or problems of a
nature designed to disrupt, disable or otherwise impair the functioning of any
IT Systems or Software. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
delivered, licensed or made available, and has no duty or obligation (whether
present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or make available, the
source code for any Software to any escrow agent or other Person who is not,
as of the date of this Agreement, an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There has not been any material malfunction with respect to any
of the IT Systems that has not been remedied or replaced.

to the Current DandO Policy, for claims made against the Pre-Closing Indemnitees
during the six (6) years following the Closing Date for actions taken by or
omitted to be taken by them prior to the Closing Date. Prior to seeking any
claim for indemnification against the Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under this Section 5.6, any indemnification or contribution
agreement with any of the foregoing Persons and/or any indemnification,
contribution, or similar provision contained in any of the organizational

reasonable efforts to recover under the Run-Off Policy.

and such Person as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the Persons
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions, and all other current
and former directors and officers of the Company, being referred to
collectively as the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_").

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Company shall not
take any action directly or indirectly to amend, repeal or modify the
provisions of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate and Bylaws with
respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability of the officers and
directors (unless required by Law) set forth in such Amended and Restated
Certificate and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Effective Time in any manner that could adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party. In the event the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, Buyer shall ensure that the
successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, or at Buyers option, Buyer, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.6.

any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain
from Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals,

required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and (iii) have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling, judgment,

is then in effect and that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal or
otherwise restricts or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall permit
the Buyer reasonably to participate in the defense and settlement of any
claim, suit or cause of action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the

pursuant to an appropriate joint defense and confidentiality agreement) with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between it and any
such Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials can
be entirely withheld if they relate to the valuation of the transaction or
where sharing the information would, in the good faith belief of the party
whose material it is, would be prohibited by Law or violate contractual
obligations and (E) furnishing the other with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as each of them may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Authority.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give promptly such
notice to third parties that are necessary pursuant to Contracts by which the

to obtain consents and estoppel certificates from third parties in each case
that are necessary (if any) pursuant to Contracts by which the Company is
bound in connection with

 



57  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to the extent requested by the Buyer in its sole discretion. The Buyer shall
cooperate with and assist the Company in giving such notices and obtaining
such consents and estoppel certificates (if any); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Buyer shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice, consent or

interests of the Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) From time to time after the Closing, and for no further consideration,
each of the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and
other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall not be
required by this Section to take or agree to undertake any action, including
entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement,
that would (A) require the divestiture of any assets of the Buyer, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates or (B) limit the Buyers freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or businesses or any of the
Buyers or its Affiliates other assets or businesses.

Section 5.9 _Termination of Indebtedness_. The Company shall negotiate Debt
Payoff Letters for all Payoff Indebtedness. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary to facilitate the
termination of all Contracts relating to Payoff Indebtedness and all interest
rate swap or other hedging agreements, the termination of the commitments
provided thereunder, the repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding
thereunder (using funds provided by the Buyer) and the release of all
Encumbrances in connection therewith on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall this Section 5.9 require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to cause the termination of any Contracts relating to
Payoff Indebtedness or any interest rate swap or other hedging agreements
other than as part of the Closing.

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties
shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining
the other parties written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by applicable Law.

Section 5.11 _Company 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
freeze and terminate any "401(k)" plan sponsored by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), with the actual
effective date of such freeze and termination of the Company 401(k) Plan to be
effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing. Following the
Closing, the Buyer 

 



58  shall allow each Continuing Employee to directly roll over cash
distributions that qualify as eligible rollover distributions from the Company
401(k) Plan to a defined contribution plan sponsored by the Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code.

Section 5.12  _Stockholder Consent_. Within twenty-four (24) hours after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer the
Stockholder Consent.

Company shall agree to the termination of, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the other parties thereto to cause the termination of, (i)
the Investor Rights Agreement, and (ii) the Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale
Agreement.

 

Section 5.14 _Option Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that (a) all of the Option plans or
other equity-based plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and (b)
after the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
bound by any Option or other equity-based right that would entitle
any Person, other than the Buyer or its Affiliates, to beneficially own, or
receive any payments other than as contemplated by Section 2.9 in respect of,
any capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.15 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

Section 5.16 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the relevant Subsidiary to, provide each Continuing Employee with (i) a
base salary or base wages at least equal to such base salary or base wages
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity compensation, defined benefit
pensions and post-employment health benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to either those provided to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or those provided by Buyer to
its similarly-situated employee from time-to-time.

(b) Buyer shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit
accrual and, for the avoidance of doubt, any vesting or service requirement
under any share or stock option of Buyer) for service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides such past service credit under its employee benefit plans) under each
of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Buyer or
the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee
becomes a participant; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that no such service
recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. As of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary to, credit to
Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued as of the Closing Date.

 

(c) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer or
the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing Employees, subject
only to any

 



59  required approval of the applicable insurance provider, if any, Buyer shall
(a) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under such plan, and (b) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable plan maintained by Buyer or the relevant Subsidiary, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. In the event
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation terminates any Plan that is a Section 125
plan flexible spending arrangement, the Surviving Corporation shall transfer
and Buyer shall accept the flexible spending account elections and accounts of
the Continuing Employees.

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any
Continuing Employee to continued employment by the Company or by Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates or otherwise modify the "at-will" nature of
such employment, (ii) confer upon any Continuing Employee any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, (iii) require the Company or
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to continue any Plans or other
employee benefit plans, as applicable, or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof on or after the Closing Date, or (iv) be treated as a
restatement, amendment or waiver of or to any particular Plan or other
employee benefit plan.

 

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS 

Section 6.1 _End of Tax Year; Closing Date Course of Business_. The Buyer and
its domestic Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, will file a
consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return for the first taxable period
ending after the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates shall not knowingly
take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that may prevent the Tax
year of the Company from ending for applicable income Tax purposes at the end
of the day on the Closing Date. For the portion of the Closing Date after
the Closing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of the Subsidiaries
will knowingly take any action that will result in any liability for Taxes (or
any reduction in Tax attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods) other than actions taken in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with prior practice (or actions explicitly
contemplated by this Agreement), unless (i) otherwise required by applicable
Law or (ii) if the Buyer agrees it is not entitled to any indemnification in
respect of Taxes that would not have been incurred but for such actions
(determined on a with and without basis).

 

Section 6.2 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) The Company will prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of
the Company before the Closing Date (other than any Tax Return with respect to
a Straddle Period). Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent
with the prior practice of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to any such filing (or if such
filing due date is sooner, as soon as reasonably practicable), the Company
will deliver to the Buyer such Tax Returns for the Buyers review and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



60 (b) The Company, at the Buyers cost and expense, will prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period required to be filed after the Closing Date and all
Straddle Period Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company and Section 6.2(c) unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to
the filing thereof (or, if such filing due date is sooner as soon as
reasonably practicable), the Company will deliver to the Seller
Representative such Tax Returns for the Seller Representatives review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Company will be responsible for paying any Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns (subject to indemnification for Holder Taxes as
provided in Section 8.2(d)).

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the income Tax Returns
described in Section 6.2(b) shall be prepared in accordance with the following
rules:

(i) No election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable applicable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law) shall be made with respect to
the Buyers acquisition of the stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative; _provided_ ,
that the Buyer shall be permitted to make or cause the Company to make such an
election if the Buyer agrees it is not entitled to any indemnification in
respect of Taxes that would not have been incurred but for such election
(determined on a with and without basis);

(ii) The Company shall make a timely election under Revenue Procedure
2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746, to apply the seventy percent (70%) safe-harbor to
any Transaction Expenses that are "success based fees" as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f);

 

(iii) To the extent permitted by Law, all Transaction Deductions will be
included on Tax Returns for the year deemed to end as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date; and

(iv) Any net operating loss for the year deemed to end on the Closing Date
shall be carried back.

 

(d) The Buyer and its Affiliates will not, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law: (i) except for Tax Returns that are filed in accordance with
Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.7, file or amend, or permit the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to file or amend, any Tax Return
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) with respect to Tax
Returns filed pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.7, after the date such
Tax Returns are filed pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.7, amend or
permit any of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to amend any such
Tax Return, (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or
permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to extend or
waive, any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any
Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) make or change
any election or change any method of accounting

 



61  with respect to Taxes with retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
for any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, if such action would
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Holders. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, to the extent the Buyer and its Affiliates believe an action
otherwise subject to this Section 6.2(d) is required by applicable law, the
Buyer shall inform the Seller Representative of such belief in writing at
least twenty (20) days prior to the taking of any action otherwise prohibited
by this Section 6.2(d) and shall consult in good faith with Seller
Representative with respect to such determination before taking any
such action.

Section 6.3 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the determination of the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that
ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other that began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain and
deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment factors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be allocated
between such two taxable periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the taxable period of the applicable entity ended on the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (a) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation, and (b) periodic
Taxes, such as property or similar ad valorem Taxes, shall be apportioned
ratably between such periods on the basis of the number of days elapsed in
each such period.

Section 6.4 _Cooperation_. The Buyer, the Company and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with the preparation and filing
of all Tax Returns and any Tax Claim or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
parties request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such matter and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Company shall (a) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to such entities and
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the relevant taxable periods (and
any extension thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (b) give the Seller
Representative written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the Seller Representative so requests, the
Company and the Buyer shall allow the Seller Representative to take possession
of such books and records.

Section 6.5 _Tax Claims_.

 

(a) In accordance with Section 8.4(a), the Buyer, the Company, and the Seller
Representative shall promptly notify each other in writing upon receipt of
any notice of any pending or threatened claim, audit, notice of deficiency,
examination, assessment, or any other proceeding (collectively a " _Tax Claim_
") which may affect any Tax liability for which the other party is liable.

(b) The Seller Representative shall have the right to (i) represent the
interests of the Company in any Tax Claim relating solely to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period for which the

 



62  Holders will be solely liable and (ii) employ counsel of the Seller
Representatives choice in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to any such Tax Claim, the Buyer shall have the right, directly
or through its designated representatives, to review in advance and comment
upon all submissions made in the course of such Tax Claim and otherwise
participate in such Tax Claim, and the Seller Representative shall not settle
or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(c) The Buyer shall control any Tax Claim in respect of (x) any Pre-Closing
Tax Period of the Company not covered by Section 6.5(b) and (y) any Straddle
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Claim, the
Seller Representative shall have the right, directly or through its designated
representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all submissions made
in the course of such Tax Claim and otherwise participate in such Tax Claim,
and none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall settle or otherwise
dispose of any such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of
the Seller Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, control of Tax Claims shall be governed by
this Section 6.5 and not Section 8.4(b).

Section 6.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the Holders. Any party required
under applicable Law to file any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax Return (and the other parties shall
cooperate with respect thereto as necessary and shall reimburse the party
filing such Tax Return pursuant to this Section 6.6 for its share of such
Transfer Taxes), and any expenses related to such filing shall be borne in
the same manner as the applicable Transfer Taxes are borne pursuant to this
Section 6.6.

Section 6.7 _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent any such amount is included
as a current asset in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.13, the Holders shall be entitled to
receive, in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions, all refunds (or credits
for overpayments) of Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (provided that with respect to any Straddle Period
the refund (or credit for overpayment) shall be calculated consistent with
Section 6.3). Promptly upon receipt or realization of any such refund (or
credits for overpayments), the Buyer shall, at the Holders expense, cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay over by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, such refunds or credits to the Paying Agent (for distribution to the
Stockholders) and the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary (for
distribution to holders of the Vested Options), net of any Tax or other out-
of-pocket cost to the Buyer Parties resulting from the receipt and
distribution of such refund, for distribution by the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to the Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions. Upon reasonable request
from the Seller Representative and unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
file an amended Tax Return in order to obtain a Tax refund (or credits for
overpayment) that the Holders are entitled to pursuant to this Section 6.7,
and the Buyer shall permit the Seller Representative to participate in the
prosecution of any such refund claim, provided, in each case, that the
foregoing actions would not have an adverse effect on any of the Buyer
Parties (as

 



63  determined in the Buyers reasonable discretion) and provided further that
the Holders shall be responsible for any costs, expenses or Taxes incurred by
any of the Buyer Parties as a result of taking any of the foregoing actions,
and the Seller Representative shall reimburse the relevant Buyer Party for any
such costs, expenses or Taxes by prompt payment as and when notified of the
amount owed by the relevant Buyer Party.

 

Section 6.8 _Tax Treatment_. Unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable
Law (or change in applicable Law) or pursuant to a "determination" as defined
in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or corresponding provision of state law), for
all Tax purposes the parties to this agreement agree to, and no party shall
take any action or filing position inconsistent with, the following Tax
treatment of the items specified below:

(a) _Seller Representative Reserve_. The Holders shall be treated
as receiving their Pro Rata Portions of the Seller Representative Reserve on
the Closing Date, and then each Holder shall be treated as having contributed
such amount to the bank account designated by the Seller Representative (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, (i) Tax withholding with respect to such deemed
contribution of any Holder shall be satisfied from such Holders share of the
Merger Consideration that is not withheld for the Estimated Cash Merger
Consideration and shall not reduce the Seller Representative Reserve, and
(ii) any portion of the Seller Representative Reserve remaining that is
returned to a Holder shall not be subject to information reporting or Tax
withholding).

 

(b) _Payments of Net Adjustment Amount, Indemnity Escrow Fund and Tax Refunds
to Stockholders_. The rights of the Stockholders to the Net Adjustment
Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Fund and amounts under Section 6.7 in respect of
their surrendered shares of Stock shall be treated as deferred contingent
purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of
the Code and any corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S.
applicable Law, as appropriate.

(c) _Payments in Respect of Options_. Subject to Section 6.8(a) in respect of
the Seller Representative Reserve, any Merger Consideration paid to holders of
the Vested Options in respect of their surrendered Vested Options pursuant to
this Agreement (i) shall be treated as compensation paid by the Surviving
Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary as and when received by the holder
thereof to whom such payment is due (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
be the Closing Date with respect to the Seller Representative Reserve and
when released to such holder in the case of the Net Adjustment Amount, the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, and amounts under Section 6.7), (ii) shall be net of
any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.14, (iii) for payments in respect of
surrendered Vested Options that were granted to the Holder in the Holders
capacity as an employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries for
applicable employment Tax purposes (" _Employee Options_ "), shall be paid
through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary
and reported on IRS Form W-2, and (iv) for payments in respect of surrendered
Vested Options that are not Employee Options, shall be paid by physical check
(and not through payroll) and reported on IRS Form 1099-MISC.

arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed by the
Company, without giving effect to: (x) any qualifications or limitations as to

and hold harmless the Holders and their Affiliates and the respective
Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing from and

69 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer or Merger

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Buyer or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any schedule,
certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect
of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall deliver
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") in respect thereof to the Seller Representative,
on behalf of the Holders, or to the Buyer, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after receipt by such Indemnified Party
of notice of the Third Party Claim, and shall provide the Indemnifying Party
with such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. A Claim Notice shall include (only to the extent known to
or calculable by the Indemnified Party) in reasonable detail a summary of the
claim, the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim, the relevant
sections of this Agreement pursuant to which the claim is made and a good
faith estimate of the Losses incurred or expected to be incurred. The failure
to deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under Article VI and this Article VIII except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure or to the extent the Claim Notice is not delivered prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.1.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations set forth in Article
VIII, including Section 8.1 and Section 8.5) that is exclusively for civil
monetary damages at law pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 25 days of receipt of a Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, to assume the
defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which expenses
shall not be applied against any indemnity limitation herein) with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for
equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal
liability, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party (solely and to the extent provided in
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 and subject to the limitations set forth in
Article VIII), any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
failed to assume the defense thereof, but solely to the extent provided in
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 and subject to the limitations on indemnification
set forth in this Article VIII (including Section 8.1 and Section 8.5). If the
Indemnifying Party

 



70  does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within the time period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of
this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to
assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that
if such settlement is entered without the Indemnifying Partys consent, such
settlement shall not be an evidence against the Indemnifying Party with
respect to the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
the Indemnified Party or the amount of Losses with respect to the underlying
claim and the Indemnified Party shall be required to prove its right for
indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 and the amount of Losses
incurred with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to
the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the representation by
counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party is reasonably likely to present such counsel with a conflict
of interest. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense,
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if
such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any
obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder.

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall deliver a Claim Notice in
respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness after
becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. Such Claim Notice shall include (to
the extent known to or calculable by the Indemnified Party) in reasonable
detail a summary of the claim, the facts and circumstances giving rise
to such claim, the relevant sections of this Agreement pursuant to which the
claim is made and a good faith estimate of the Losses incurred or expected to
be incurred. The failure to deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under Article VI and this
Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure or to the extent the Claim Notice is not delivered
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 8.1 and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other
obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise
than pursuant to this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within 40 days following its receipt of a Claim Notice
that

 



71  includes the information required pursuant to this Section 8.4(c) and is
marked as a Claim Notice given pursuant to this Section 8.4(c) in respect of a
Direct Claim that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder, such Direct Claim specified by the Indemnified
Party in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount
of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand, all subject to the
limitations on liability set forth in this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying
Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but asserts that it is
obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the
Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Partys
claim for the difference.

(d) Following determination of a Claim Notice pursuant to the procedures
described in this Section 8.4, the indemnification required hereunder shall
be made by prompt payment by the Escrow Agent (to the extent of any amounts
then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund if applicable) or the Indemnifying
Party (to the extent of any amounts not then held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund if applicable) of the amount of actual Losses in connection therewith,
subject at all times to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this
Article VIII, as and when bills are received by the Indemnifying Party
or Losses incurred have been notified to the Indemnifying Party within twenty
Business Days after receipt of notice of such Losses. Nothing in this Section
8.4(d) shall derogate from the right of the Seller Representative to contest
the indemnification obligation or the amount of Losses being claimed.

Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (1)
an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as the case may be, unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from
the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $1,500,000, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the amount of such Losses in
excess of $1,500,000, (2) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or relating
to the causes set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as the case may
be, shall be an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") and (3) the
Holders shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer or any other Person
with respect to any Loss to the extent that a specific accrual or reserve for
the amount of such Loss was taken into account in calculating the Net
Adjustment Amount, _provided_ , that the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) shall
not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of
(i) any Fundamental Representation, (ii) any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3.15 (Taxes), or (iii) any representation or warranty in the
event of fraud (made with intent to deceive), _provided_ , _further_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate amount
of Losses that a Holder may be liable for pursuant to this Agreement shall not
exceed the consideration received by such Holder under this Agreement and/or
in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement (including the SPA Purchase
Price, and for the avoidance of doubt without reduction for any Taxes paid or
payable with respect to any such consideration, or any Taxes withheld or
deducted from any such consideration and paid over in accordance with Section
2.14) (the " _Aggregate Cap_ "), except in the event of fraud (made with
intent to deceive) committed by such Holder.

 



72 (b) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the amount of any Loss subject to indemnification pursuant to
this Article VIII shall be calculated net of (i) any insurance proceeds
received or receivable by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates on
account of such Loss, (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party in the year of payment or the following year arising from
the recognition of such Loss, determined on a with and without basis and (iii)
any indemnification, contribution or other payment received or receivable
from any third Person with respect to such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall
(A) seek full recovery from any third parties and under all insurance policies
covering, and all right to indemnification and/or contribution from third
Persons in respect of, any Loss and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
mitigate any actual or potential Loss, in each case to the same extent as it
would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII. In the event any payment is made in respect of Losses, the
Indemnifying Party who made such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to any related rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party
receiving such payment against any third party. In the event that an
insurance, indemnification, contribution or other recovery is made or a Tax
benefit is realized (as described in the first sentence of this Section
8.5(b)) by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which it has
been indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery or benefit shall be paid promptly in
immediately available funds to the Indemnifying Party that provided such
indemnification to the Indemnified Party. The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to recover more than once for the same Loss and shall not be entitled
to recover any Loss if and to the extent such Loss is reflected in the
calculation of Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Closing Net Working
Capital.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Losses shall not include
any special, indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, consequential or
similar damages and/or any diminution in value or lost profits.

 

Section 8.6 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) The Buyer hereby agrees that with respect to all Losses (including Taxes)
it shall seek a remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of the
amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with respect to any
indemnification claim asserted hereunder before seeking to recover any Losses
directly from the Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Indemnitees
may not seek to recover any Losses directly from the Holders unless it seeks
to recover such Losses from at least all former holders of Preferred Stock
based on their Pro Rata Portion. To the extent that the amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund (including the interest or other income accrued
thereon) (i) has been distributed to the Holders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Portions following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) has been exhausted or (iii) would be
exhausted if one or more pending claims against the Holders are resolved in
favor of an Buyer Indemnified Party, then subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article VIII, such claim may be made directly against the Holders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.

(b) Within one Business Day after the date that is the twelve month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _General Cut-Off Date_ "), the Buyer
shall pay, or caused to be paid, to the Paying Agent (for distribution to the
Stockholders in respect of their surrendered 

 



73  Stock) and the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiaries (for
distribution to holders of the Vested Options in respect of their surrendered
Vested Options in accordance with Section 6.8(c)) an aggregate amount equal
to (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund
_less_ (ii) a reasonable and good faith estimate of the amount of the Losses
for all claims for indemnification made pursuant to Section 8.2 then-pending
(the amount of (ii), the " _Pending Claims Holdback Amount_ "); _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that all amounts paid to the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiaries shall be promptly
distributed by such Persons to the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Portions.

 

(c) At any time following the General Cut-Off Date, to the extent the Pending
Claims Holdback Amount exceeds the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer
pursuant to claims made prior to the General Cut-Off Date and not fully
resolved in accordance with this Article VIII, any such excess funds shall be
promptly released to the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Stockholders in
respect of their surrendered Shares) and the Surviving Corporation or its
applicable Subsidiary (for distribution to holders of the Vested Options in
respect of their surrendered Vested Options), in each case for further
distribution to the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.

(d) Upon the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and, in no event later than two (2) Business Days
following such termination, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Stockholders (other than holders of any
Dissenting Shares) and holders of the Vested Options as instructed by the
Seller Representative. Payment of such amounts to Stockholders and holders of
the Vested Options shall be made based on their respective Pro Rata Portions
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
Sections 2.13 and 5.6, the indemnification provided in this Article VIII,
subject to the limitations set forth herein or in Article VI, shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party in connection with any
Losses and other monetary damages arising out of or resulting from this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The foregoing
notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 8.7 shall limit or restrict the
ability or right of any party hereto to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief for any breach or alleged breach of any provision of Article II,
Article V, Article VI, Article VIII or Article IX; _provided_ , that any
procedures in respect of and limitations on Losses or liabilities in this
Article VIII shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such relief.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Losses and
any other monetary damages that may be incurred, and that the remedies that
may be pursued, by the Buyer Indemnitees are subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.8 _Payments_. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to treat
any payments made pursuant to Article VI and this Article VIII as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required under applicable Law.

by the Company) or the Company (in the case of an assignment by the Buyer or
Merger Sub), and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall
be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer or Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Buyer without the prior consent
of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that no assignment shall limit the

prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,

jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

Section 10.18 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Buyer,
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has
been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no
application and is expressly waived.

Section 10.19 _Waiver of Conflicts_. The Buyer and the Company agree that the
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, seek to have Cooley LLP
("Cooley") disqualified from representing the Seller Representative, any
Holder or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute
that may arise between the Seller Representative, any Holder or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other, in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with any such dispute that may
arise between the Seller Representative, any Holder or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Seller Representative (and not Buyer or the Company) shall have
the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege (the
" _Retained Privilege_ ") that may apply to any communications between the
Company and Cooley that occurred before the Closing; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the forgoing shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement, the Merger or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby, or to communications with any Person other than Cooley;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Section 10.19 shall be construed
as a waiver of any attorney-client privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between the Company and any other person,
the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to
such other person of confidential communications between Cooley and the
Company. Nothing in this Section 10.19 shall be construed as a waiver of any
privilege controlled by the Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company after the Closing
(which for the avoidance of doubt excludes the Retained Privilege), nor shall
anything herein be construed to permit Cooley to communicate to the Seller
Representative, any Holder or any of their respective Affiliates after the
Closing any information subject to a privilege controlled by the Buyer,
Merger Sub, or the Company (which for the avoidance of doubt excludes the
Retained Privilege). Notwithstanding any other provision herein, this Section
10.19 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.19 may be
amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative and Cooley.
