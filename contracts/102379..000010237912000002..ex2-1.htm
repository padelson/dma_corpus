reporting and any material weaknesses, that have more than a remote chance to
materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data as defined in applicable Securities Laws

or other employees who have or had a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting.

Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which
they might most effectively be undertaken; provided that the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganizations are not, in the opinion of the Company, acting reasonably,
prejudicial to the Company or the Shareholders in any material respect (having
regard to the indemnities provided herein). The Purchaser shall provide
written notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
at least 20 Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Purchaser and the Company shall work co-operatively and use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all

reasonable legal fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization; and (y) indemnify the Company for any
losses or costs (other than those reimbursed in accordance with the foregoing)

for purposes of the Tax Act and agrees to (i) co-operate with the Purchaser in
order to facilitate the bump transactions or other reorganizations or
transactions which the Purchaser determines would be advisable to enhance the
tax efficiency of the combined corporate group, and (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such information on a timely basis and to assist
in the obtaining of any such information in order to facilitate a successful
completion of the bump transactions or any such other reorganizations or
transactions as is reasonably requested by the Purchaser.

The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion

extent that it is entitled to do so (and exercise all rights it has to
require) the return or destruction of all confidential information regarding
the Company, its subsidiaries, the Joint Ventures or FT Services previously
provided to any such Person. The Company agrees that it shall not terminate,
waive, release, amend, modify or otherwise forebear from the enforcement of,
and agrees to actively prosecute and enforce, any agreement containing

Notwithstanding Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b) and any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the time at which the Final Order is granted by the Court (the "Final Order
Issuance Time"), the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal not
resulting from a breach of this Section 7.1 and the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisors, (A) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) that
the failure to take the relevant action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, following
compliance with Section 7.1(d):

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal; and/or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain discussions or negotiations
with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

provided that the Company shall not, and shall not allow the Company
Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without
having entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement with such
Person that contains provisions that are no less favourable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a correct and complete
copy of which confidentiality and standstill agreement shall be provided to
the Purchaser before any such non-public information is provided), provided
that such confidentiality and standstill agreement may not include any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may
not restrict the Company or the Company Representatives from complying with
this Section 7.1, and shall promptly provide to the Purchaser any material
non-public information concerning the Company on a consolidated basis provided
to such other Person which was not previously provided to the Purchaser.

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following
receipt) notify the Purchaser (at first orally and thereafter in writing) in
the event it receives after the date hereof but prior to the Final Order
Issuance Time, an Acquisition Proposal (including any request for non-public
information relating to the Company on a consolidated basis or for access to
the properties, books or records of the Company, in each case, in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal), and shall provide a copy thereof and all
written communications relating to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal to the Purchaser together with such details of the proposal, offer,
inquiry or request as the Purchaser may reasonably request (including the
identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and the terms and
conditions thereof), and shall regularly and promptly inform the Purchaser in
writing as to the status of developments and negotiations with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, including any changes to the material terms or
conditions, of such Acquisition Proposal.

(e)

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Final Order Issuance
Time the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a breach
of this Section 7.1 that the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.2, authorize the Company to pay the Break
Fee and terminate this Agreement and thereafter enter into such definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and if and only if:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

the Company has complied fully with all of its obligations under this Section
7.1;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

it has provided the Purchaser with a copy of the Superior Proposal document
and all supporting materials, including any financing documents supplied to
the Company in connection therewith, and written confirmation from the Company
that the Board of Directors has determined that the proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

five Business Days (the "Matching Period") shall have elapsed from the date
that is the later of:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(A)

  |  

the date the Purchaser received written notice advising the Purchaser that the
Board of Directors has resolved, subject only to compliance with this Section
7.1, to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(B)

  |  

the date the Purchaser has received all of the materials set forth in Section
7.1(e)(ii); and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

the Purchaser has offered to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this
Agreement during the Matching Period pursuant to Section 7.1(f), such
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal compared to the
amendment offered by the Purchaser at the termination of the Matching Period.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

During the Matching Period, the Company agrees that the Purchaser shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the
Arrangement and this Agreement. The Board of Directors shall review any offer
by the Purchaser to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement in
good faith in order to determine, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and
in consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, whether the
Purchaser's amended offer, upon acceptance by the Company would cause the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Matching Period to cease to be a Superior
Proposal. If the Board of Directors so determines, the Company shall enter
into an amended agreement with the Purchaser reflecting the Purchaser's
amended offer. If, after the expiry of the Matching Period, the Board of
Directors continues to believe, in good faith, in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties and after consultation with its financial and outside legal
advisors, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and
therefore rejects the Purchaser's amended offer, if any, or the Purchaser
fails to enter into an agreement with the Company reflecting such amended
offer, the Company and the Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with
the other provisions hereof including payment of the Break Fee as set forth in
Section 8.2(b), effect a Change in Recommendation and/or, terminate this
Agreement, in order to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of the
Superior Proposal.

  |  

In the event that the Company provides the notice contemplated by Section
7.1(e)(ii) on a date which is less than five Business Days prior to the
Company Meeting, the Purchaser shall be entitled to require the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to a date that is not more than seven
Business Days after the date of such notice.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(h)

  |  

The Company acknowledges that each amendment or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes
of the requirement under Section 7.1(e)(iii) and shall initiate a new five
Business Day Matching Period.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

The Company shall ensure that the Company Representatives are aware of the
obligations in this Section 7.1 and the Company shall be responsible for any
breach of this Section 7.1 by the Company Representatives.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(j)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.1, the
Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change in Recommendation, undertake
any of the activities set out in Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(ii),
accept an offer or proposal from, or enter into an agreement with, any third
party in respect of any Acquisition Proposal following the Final Order

(c)

  |  

For greater certainty, the Purchaser shall treat, and shall cause the
Purchaser Representatives to treat, all confidential or proprietary
information furnished to the Purchaser or the Purchaser Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
information furnished pursuant to Section 7.4) in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Purchaser shall be entitled
to provide such information to the Financing Parties in connection with any
financing activities undertaken in connection with the Arrangement as well as
their respective representatives and to rating agencies, subject to the
confidentiality conditions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.

   
---|---

(iv)

  |  

notwithstanding any other provision herein, where the disclosure or transfer
of Transferred Information to Purchaser or its affiliates requires the consent
of, or the provision of notice to, the individual to which such Transferred
Information relates, to not require or accept the disclosure or transfer of
such Transferred Information until the Company has first notified such
individual of such disclosure or transfer and the purpose for same, and where

the transactions contemplated herein and as authorized or permitted by Law.

The Company and the Purchaser shall co-operate in the provision of such
notifications as are required by applicable privacy laws to the individuals to
whom the Transferred Information relates that the Arrangement has taken place
and of any disclosure or transfers of the Transferred Information to the
Purchaser or its affiliates.

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

If the Company fails to pay the Break Fee or the Non-Completion Fee when due
hereunder, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Purchaser commences a

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

within a period of 12 months following such termination of this Agreement, any

(h)

  |  

Any Break Fee or Non-Completion Fee payable by the Company shall be paid free
and clear of and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by
Law. If the Company is required by applicable Laws to deduct or withhold any
Taxes from any payment of a Break Fee or Non-Completion Fee, (i) the amount
payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all
required deductions or withholdings (including deductions and withholdings
applicable to, and taking into account all Taxes on, or arising by reason of,
the payment of additional amounts under this Section 8.2(h)), the Purchaser
receives an amount equal to the amount that it would have received had no such
deductions or withholdings been required, (ii) the Company shall make such
required deductions or withholdings, and (iii) the Company shall remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the appropriate Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Laws.

(i)

  |  

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the Break Fee and the Non-Completion
Fee set out in this Section 8.2 are payments of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Purchaser will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant
termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. The Company irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

8.3 Notice and Effect of Termination

  

   

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other
than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) shall give notice of such termination to the
other Party setting out in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect without liability of any Party (or any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative
of such Party) to the other Party hereto, except that:

8.1; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

neither the termination of this Agreement nor, anything contained in this
Section 8.3(a) shall relieve any Party of any liability for any breach of this
Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

lxxxxix  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.4 Waiver

  

   

  

  

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar) or a
future waiver of the same provisions, nor, shall such waiver be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. No failure or
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor, shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable
Laws.

limitation of the foregoing, the Parties agree that no Claim or cause of
action shall be asserted against a Financing Party and that any proceeding or
action to which a Financing Party is or is sought to be made a party shall be
brought exclusively in the courts of the State of New York or the Federal
Courts of the United States of America, in each case, located in the County of
New York and the Borough of Manhattan and each Party waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right it may have to trial by jury in any
proceeding or action involving a Financing Party. The Financing Parties are

Section 9.3.

entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c) or Section 4.1, as applicable,
and Section 5.1(a) and, for greater certainty, no such holder will be entitled
to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection
therewith, other than any declared but unpaid dividends with a record date
prior to the Effective Date. No dividend or other distribution declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to the Shares with a record date on
or after the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Date,
represented outstanding Shares.

5.2 Lost Certificates

  

   

  

  

In the event that any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding Shares that were transferred pursuant
to Section 3.1(c) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, cash deliverable in accordance with
such holder's Letter of Transmittal (including the certificate of loss). When
authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to be delivered shall, as a
condition precedent to the delivery of such cash, give a bond satisfactory to
the Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum
as the Purchaser may direct, or otherwise indemnify the Purchaser, the

Acquiror and the Company, acting reasonably, against any claim that may be
made against the Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Company with respect to the

remains unclaimed, in each case, on the third anniversary of the Effective
Time, less one (1) day, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that
remains outstanding on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, less one
(1) day, shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature, and
the right of the holder to receive any consideration for the Shares, Options

At any time and from time to time, the Acquiror shall be entitled to direct
Computershare by written notice (a) not to deposit any new amounts in any
Approved Bank specified in the notice and/or (b) to withdraw all or any of the
Amount Held that may then be deposited with any Approved Bank specified in the
notice. With respect to any withdrawal notice, Computershare will endeavour to
withdraw such amount specified in the notice as soon as reasonably practicable
and the Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that such specified amount remains at
the sole risk of the Acquiror prior to and after such withdrawal.

  

  

    

5.3

Computershare does not have any interest in the Amount Held but is serving as
depositary only and is not a debtor of the Acquiror in respect of the Amount
Held. All interest accruing on the Amount Held shall be on account of the
Acquiror.
