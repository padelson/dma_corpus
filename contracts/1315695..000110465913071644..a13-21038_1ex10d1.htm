_Buyer_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used
as defined in _Exhibit A_.

acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

1.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) At least five (5) Business Days and not more than seven (7) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, or shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer, a statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail its good faith estimate of each of the Purchase Price
Adjustments, determined in accordance with the definitions of Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash Balances, Transferred Company Indebtedness, and Augusta
Underspend; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Retained Cash Balances and
Transferred Company Indebtedness included in the Estimated Closing Statement
shall not include any Retained Cash Balances or Transferred Company
Indebtedness arising under any Enterprise Agreements, which, however, shall be
included in the final determination of the Retained Cash Balances and
Transferred Company Indebtedness. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
accompanied by a certificate executed by a senior financial officer of Parent
to the effect that the Estimated Closing Statement has been prepared in good
faith in accordance with this Section 1.5(a). If Parent employs a firm of
independent accountants in connection with the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Statement, subject to the execution by Buyer of a customary non-
reliance letter, Parent shall cause such independent accountants to deliver to
Buyer and its Representatives any workpapers used in the preparation of the
Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 1.2 as if Parents estimate of the Purchase Price
Adjustments, each as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, were the
actual amounts. The Purchase Price as so estimated is referred to as the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_."

 



 

(c) On or prior to the date that is seventy-five (75) days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the "
_Final Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its
calculation of each of the Purchase Price Adjustments, determined in
accordance with the definitions of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash
Balances, Transferred Company Indebtedness and Augusta Underspend. The Final
Closing Statement shall also set forth Buyers calculation of the Purchase
Price. The Final Closing Statement shall be accompanied by a certificate
executed by a senior financial officer of Buyer to the effect that the Final
Closing Statement has been prepared in good faith in accordance with this
Section 1.5(c). The Final Closing Statement shall also set forth, and explain,
in reasonable detail, any differences between Buyers calculation of the
Purchase Price Adjustments from Parents estimate of the Purchase Price
Adjustments set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall make available to Parent all workpapers and other books and
records utilized by Buyer in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement,
and shall make available to Parent those of its Representatives involved in
the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. If Buyer employs a firm of
independent accountants in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

preparation of the Final Closing Statement, subject to the execution by Parent
of a customary non-reliance letter, Buyer shall cause such independent
accountants to deliver to Parent and its Representatives any workpapers used
in the preparation of the Final Closing Statement. Parent shall notify Buyer
in writing within forty-five (45) days after Parents receipt of the Final
Closing Statement that it accepts the Final Closing Statement or that there is
a dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") as to any item reflected thereon (the "
_Disputed Items_ "). The Dispute Notice will set forth Parents objections, if
any, to the Final Closing Statement in reasonable detail and Parents
calculation of each of the Purchase Price Adjustments. If Parent timely
delivers to Buyer a Dispute Notice, only the Disputed Items shall be deemed to
be in dispute, and all other matters included in the Final Closing Statement
delivered by Buyer shall be deemed to be final and binding on the parties
hereto. The failure by Parent to deliver to Buyer the Dispute Notice within
such period shall be deemed to constitute Parents acceptance of the Final
Closing Statement. After timely delivery of the Dispute Notice by Parent, the
parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any Disputed
Items, and any resolution by Parent and Buyer of such Disputed Items shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto.

 



 

(e) If any Disputed Items cannot be resolved by the parties within forty-five
(45) days after Parent delivers the Dispute Notice to Buyer, such Disputed
Items shall be referred to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP declines the engagement,
any other independent public accounting firm of national stature which is
mutually satisfactory to Parent and Buyer (the " _Selected Accountant_ "). The
determination of the Selected Accountant shall be conclusive and binding on
each party. The fees and expenses of the Selected Accountant shall be shared
equally by Parent and Buyer. Not later than twenty (20) days after the
referral of any Disputed Items to the Selected Accountant, Parent and Buyer
shall concurrently submit written statements to the Selected Accountant (with
a copy to the other party) setting forth their respective positions regarding
the Disputed Items which remain in dispute. Parent and Buyer shall instruct
the Selected Accountant to render its decision resolving the dispute within
sixty (60) days after submission of the written statements, and during such
period, the parties shall make available to the Selected Accountant such
employees, information, books and records as may be reasonably requested by
the Selected Accountant to make its final determination. In resolving any
Disputed Item, the Selected Accountant (i) shall be bound by the provisions of
this Section 1.5 and the definitions of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash
Balances, Transferred Company Indebtedness and Augusta Underspend; (ii) shall
limit its review to the Disputed Items submitted to the Selected Accountant
for resolution and not otherwise investigate matters independently; and (iii)
shall further limit its review of the Disputed Items solely to whether the
Final Closing Statement has been prepared in accordance with this Section 1.5
or contains any mathematical or clerical error. The determination of any
Disputed Items cannot, however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or
lowest value, respectively, claimed for any such item in the Final Closing
Statement or the Dispute Notice. Parent and Buyer agree that the resolution by
the Selected Accountant of any Disputed Items shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto. Parent and Buyer agree that the procedure set forth in
this Section 1.5 for resolving disputes with respect to the Purchase Price
Adjustments shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving such
disputes, _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto agree that judgment
may be entered upon the determination of the Selected Accountant in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.5
(i) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Parent shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the shortfall; or (ii) is more than the Estimated Purchase
Price, Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the excess. Any such
payment pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account (or accounts) designated by Buyer
or Parent, as the case may be, on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Business
Day after acceptance or deemed acceptance by Parent of the Final Closing
Statement (as contemplated by paragraph (d) above) or (y) the second (2nd)
Business Day following resolution of any Disputed Items (as contemplated by
paragraphs (d) or (e) above); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties are
disputing the final calculation of the Purchase Price, to the extent part of
any payment that would be payable pursuant to this paragraph (f) is not in
dispute, the payor shall pay the amount not in dispute on the date the payment
would otherwise be due but for such dispute by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account (or accounts) designated by the recipient. All
payments made pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be accompanied by interest
at a rate equal to the Prime Rate per annum from the Closing Date through (but
excluding) the date such payment is made. " _Prime Rate_ " shall mean, for any
day, the rate of interest per annum (over a year of 360 days) announced by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor thereto) from time to time, as its
"base rate" in effect on such date. Any amounts payable by either party
pursuant to this paragraph (f) may not be reduced by set-off against any
amount(s) payable (whether at such time or in the future or upon the
occurrence of a contingency) by the recipient or any Affiliate of the
recipient to the payor or any Affiliates of the payor. Any payment required
pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall constitute a payment in respect of the
Purchase Price.

 



 

(g) If the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the French Companies is
higher than the portion of the Estimated Purchase Price allocated to the
French Companies, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer tax
forms "Cerfa" no 2759, duly signed by the French Seller, in relation to the
additional amounts allocated to the French Companies no later than on the
second (2nd) Business Day after the date when the Purchase Price has finally
been determined pursuant to this Section 1.5.

 



 

(h) If the delivery deadline date for the Final Closing Statement or the
Dispute Notice is a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable delivery
deadline date shall be the immediately following Business Day.

 



 

1.6 _Augusta Cost Overrun Reimbursement_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall pay to Buyer (i) the amount by which the Augusta Construction
Cost paid by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Augusta Construction Cost_
") plus the Augusta Spending Benchmark as of the Closing, exceeds $172.0
million (such excess being, the " _Augusta Cost Overrun Amount_ ") and (ii)
the amount of any Augusta Qualified Costs.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent, on or prior to the date that is
ninety (90) days following the successful completion of the Performance Test
of the Augusta Facility, a statement (the " _Augusta Cost Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Post-Closing Augusta
Construction Cost, the Augusta Cost Overrun Amount, if any, and the Augusta
Qualified Costs, if any. The Augusta Cost Statement shall be

 



      
 

 



 

accompanied by a certificate executed by a senior financial officer of Buyer
to the effect that the Augusta Cost Statement has been prepared in good faith
in accordance with this Section 1.6.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall make available to Parent all invoices, receipts and other
books and records of Buyer relevant to the preparation of the Augusta Cost
Statement, including all contracts entered into by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates in connection with the construction of the Augusta Facility, and
shall make available to Parent those of its Representatives involved in the
preparation of the Augusta Cost Statement. Parent shall notify Buyer in
writing within forty-five (45) days after Parents receipt of the Augusta Cost
Statement that it accepts the Augusta Cost Statement or that there is a
dispute (an " _Augusta Dispute Notice_ ") as to any item reflected thereon
(the " _Augusta Disputed Items_ "). The Augusta Dispute Notice will set forth
Parents objections, if any, to the Augusta Cost Statement in reasonable
detail and Parents calculation of the Post-Closing Augusta Construction Cost,
the Augusta Cost Overrun Amount and, if any, the Augusta Qualified Costs. If
Parent timely delivers to Buyer an Augusta Dispute Notice, only the Augusta
Disputed Items shall be deemed to be in dispute, and all other matters
included in the Augusta Cost Statement delivered by Buyer shall be deemed to
be final and binding on the parties hereto. The failure by Parent to deliver
to Buyer the Augusta Dispute Notice within such period shall be deemed to
constitute Parents acceptance of the Augusta Cost Statement. After timely
delivery of the Augusta Dispute Notice by Parent, the parties will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any Augusta Disputed Items, and any
resolution by Parent and Buyer of such Augusta Disputed Items shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto.

 



 

(d) If any Augusta Disputed Items cannot be resolved by the parties within
forty-five (45) days after Parent delivers the Augusta Dispute Notice to
Buyer, such Augusta Disputed Items shall be resolved by arbitration in
accordance with Section 4.27(i) below. Parent and Buyer agree that the
procedures set forth in Sections 1.6 and 4.27(i) for resolving disputes with
respect to the Augusta Cost Overrun Amount and, if any, the Augusta Qualified
Costs shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving such disputes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto agree that judgment may be
entered upon the determination of the Arbitrator in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

 



 

(e) Following acceptance or settlement of the Augusta Cost Statement pursuant
to this Section 1.6, Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
aggregate of the Augusta Cost Overrun Amount and, if any, the Augusta
Qualified Costs. Any such payment pursuant to the preceding sentence will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account (or
accounts) designated by Buyer on the later of (i) the second (2nd) Business
Day after acceptance or deemed acceptance by Parent of the Augusta Cost
Statement (as contemplated by paragraph (c) above); or (ii) the second (2nd)
Business Day following resolution of any Augusta Disputed Items (as
contemplated by paragraphs (c) or (d) above). Any amounts payable by Parent
pursuant to this paragraph (e) may not be reduced by set-off against any
amount(s) payable (whether at such time or in the future or upon the
occurrence of a contingency) by Parent or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates. Any payment required pursuant to this paragraph (e)
shall constitute a reduction of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(f) If the delivery deadline date for the Augusta Cost Statement or Augusta
Dispute Notice is a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable delivery
deadline date shall be the immediately following Business Day.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT_

 



 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement, delivered by Parent to Buyer contemporaneously with the delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Letter_ "), Parent hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows:

 



 

2.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Parent is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Each of the Sellers is a corporation (or other Entity)
validly existing and (if such Entity is organized in a jurisdiction in which
the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is applicable) in
good standing or its functional equivalent under the laws of its jurisdiction
of organization. _Schedule 2.1 of the Disclosure Letter_ lists each Company,
each Subsidiary of the Companies (together with the Companies, but excluding
the Retained Companies, the " _Transferred Companies_ ") and each other Entity
that is engaged in the Business in which a Seller, Company or a Transferred
Company holds a minority equity ownership interest and does not control,
including the JV Entities (the " _Non-Controlled Companies_ ") and the
business entity form and place of organization for each of the Transferred
Companies and each of the Non-Controlled Companies, together with a list of
each jurisdiction in which each U.S. Transferred Company is licensed or
qualified to do business. Each Transferred Company and, to the knowledge of
Parent, each Non-Controlled Company is (a) validly existing and (if such
Transferred Company or Non-Controlled Company is organized in a jurisdiction
in which the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is
applicable) in good standing or its functional equivalent under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization; and (b) qualified to do business and (if
such concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is applicable in
such jurisdiction) in good standing or its functional equivalent in each
jurisdiction in which the Assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it requires such qualification, except for such
failures to be so qualified and in good standing or its functional equivalent
which are not material to the operation of the Business, taken as a whole.
Each Transferred Company and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each Non-Controlled
Company has the corporate (or other Entity) authority under the Legal
Requirements pursuant to which it is organized to own, lease or operate the
Assets owned, leased or operated by it and to carry on the business as now
being conducted by it. Parent has made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of each Transferred Companys and, to the extent within Parents
possession or control, each Non-Controlled Companys Governing Documents, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Governing Documents of each of
the Transferred Companies and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the Non-
Controlled Companies are in full force and effect and none of the Transferred
Companies or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Non-Controlled Companies are in
violation of their Governing Documents.

 



 

2.2 _Capitalization_. _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_ sets forth the
authorized capital stock and other Equity Interests of each Transferred
Company and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each Non-Controlled Company and the
number of shares of such stock and Equity Interests that are issued and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement of each Transferred Company and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, each Non-Controlled Company. The ownership as of
the date of this Agreement and following the consummation of the
Restructurings of all issued and outstanding shares or other Equity Interests
owned by the applicable Seller in each

 



      
 

 



 

Transferred Company and each Non-Controlled Company is set forth on _Schedule
2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_. _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_ also
sets forth a list of the Transferred Companies that are, directly or
indirectly, wholly-owned by a Seller and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
ownership of any outstanding Equity Interests in any Transferred Company by
any third Person. _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_ also sets forth a
list of all shares of capital stock and other Equity Interests of each
Transferred Company of each class authorized, issued or outstanding. All of
the Shares (including, but only to the Knowledge of Parent, the Minority
Interests) and the Subsidiary Shares have been validly authorized and issued,
are fully paid and, in respect of such jurisdictions where such concept is
applicable, nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of any
preemptive right, purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
subscription right or any similar right. There are no bonds, debentures, notes
or other Indebtedness of any Transferred Company or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any Non-Controlled Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, Equity Interests or other securities of any
Transferred Company or Non-Controlled Company) on any matters on which holders
of Equity Interests may vote. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, there
is no security, option, warrant, right, call, subscription agreement,
commitment or other Contract of any nature whatsoever to which Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) is a party, that
directly or indirectly (a) calls for the issuance, sale, pledge or other
disposition of any shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests of a
Transferred Company or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a Non-Controlled Company,
(b) obligates a Transferred Company or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a Non-

Controlled Company. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any voting trust,
proxy or other Contract restricting or otherwise relating to the voting,
dividend rights or disposition of any Shares or any Subsidiary Shares. No
Transferred Company and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no Non-Controlled Company
is a party to, or otherwise bound by, and no Transferred Company and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no Non-Controlled Company, has granted, any stock
options, appreciation rights, participations, phantom equity or similar
rights. No Transferred Company nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, no Non-
Controlled Company, owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other

good condition, except for ordinary wear and tear.

Agreements, and after taking into account Assets, goods and services purchased
or leased by the Transferred Companies in the ordinary course of business,

 _ARTICLE IV_

 



 

 _COVENANTS_

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Parent will, and will
cause the Transferred Companies and Sellers to, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice, (i) provide to Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access to the premises (including the Leased Sites), Assets,
property, books and records of the Transferred Companies and the Business;
(ii) furnish to Buyer and its Representatives financial information, operating
data and other information pertaining to the Business and the Business Assets;
(iii) make available for inspection and copying by Buyer and its
Representatives copies of any documents relating to the foregoing; and (iv)
permit Buyer and its Representatives to conduct reasonable interviews of key

manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business;
(B) Buyer shall not be allowed to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of any Real Property, including any sampling, testing or
removal of materials (other than documents to the extent permitted hereunder)
from the offices, factories and properties of Parent, the other Sellers or the
Transferred Companies, without the prior consent of Parent (which consent can
be withheld in Parents sole discretion); and (C) Parent may limit such access
described in clauses (i) through (iv) above to the extent such access (1)
would violate or give rise to liability of Parent or its Affiliates under
applicable Legal Requirements, including any Antitrust Laws; (2) would require
Parent or any of its Affiliates to waive any attorney-client privilege; or (3)
conflicts with any confidentiality obligations to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is bound (it being understood that Parent shall, and shall cause
the Sellers and the Transferred Companies to, cooperate in commercially
reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable disclosure to
Buyer to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Legal
Requirement, privilege or confidentiality obligation). The representations,
warranties and covenants of a party and any Persons right to indemnification
or other remedy based upon any representation, warranty or covenant of a party
will not be affected or deemed waived by any investigation conducted by or on
behalf of such Person or by reason of any knowledge acquired at any time with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, such
representations, warranties or covenants.

 



 

(b) All information provided to Buyer and its Representatives by or on behalf

governed and protected by the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and
Buyer Guarantor dated April 5, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in
consultation with Parent, unless Parent has a reasonable objection in respect
of specific Business Employees,

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer shall be permitted to (i) enter into discussions and negotiations with
up to thirty (30) Business Employees concerning their employment with the
Business following the Closing; and (ii) enter into Contracts with each of
such Business Employees to the extent the effectiveness of such Contracts is
conditioned on the consummation of the Closing; _provided_ that in the event
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, Buyer agrees
that, for a period of two (2) years following the date of such termination,
neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall hire any Business Employee with
whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates had discussions with prior to the
termination of this Agreement. Following the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to use, and disclose, all information relating to the
Business free of any restrictions, and the parties hereto agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

4.2 _Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Prior to the Closing, no party shall,
and each party shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue
any press release or otherwise directly or indirectly make any public
statement, public announcement or other public disclosures with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or the rules of any stock exchange on which their securities (or
securities of any of their Affiliates) are listed, in which case, to the
extent practicable under the circumstances, the disclosing party shall allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such disclosure in advance of
its issuance (the disclosing party being under no obligation to accept any
such comments); _provided_ , _however_ , that each party may make oral or
written public announcements, releases or statements without complying with
the foregoing procedures if the substance of such announcement, release or
statement was previously publicly disclosed in accordance with the foregoing
requirements.

or conditioned) or as required by applicable Legal Requirements, Parent (to
the extent related to the Business) shall, and shall cause the Sellers (to the
extent related to the Business) and the Transferred Companies to:

Transferred Company, any Non-Controlled Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, other than a Divestiture Action; or (B) take any other action that
may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining the Approvals contemplated by this Section 4.5 other than a
Divestiture Action.

 



 

(c) Parent and Buyer shall each cooperate with the other party as reasonably
necessary and advisable to satisfy each partys obligations set forth in
Section 4.5(b). Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the preservation of
the attorney-client privilege and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, Parent and Buyer shall each keep the other informed of the status
of matters relating to the obtaining of Approval under any Antitrust Laws of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other communications between Parent or
Buyer, as the case may be, or any of their respective Affiliates (with any
competitively sensitive information being provided on an external counsel
basis only), and any Governmental Authority under or related to any Antitrust
Laws with respect to such transactions. Parent and Buyer shall permit counsel
for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and shall
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with any
proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Parent shall obtain
the consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), if it selects or retains outside experts or
economists to assist the parties with any review or investigation initiated by
a Governmental Authority under Antitrust Laws of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent and Buyer each agree to not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties will consult and cooperate with the other and consider
in good faith the views of the other party in connection with any filing,
analysis, presentation or argument to be made or submitted to the FTC, DOJ,
the European Commission or other Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust
Laws or Antitrust Approvals in connection with the

 



       
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that Buyer shall, in
good faith and in consultation with Parent (as provided in Sections 4.5(c) and
(d)), be entitled to direct and make all final decisions in determining,
managing and implementing the strategy and timing for taking any actions and
the negotiations and communications with any Governmental Authority with
respect to any actions set forth in Section 4.5.

 



 

4.6 _Use of Name_.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that (except as expressly set forth in this Section 4.6(a))
after the Closing neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) shall have any rights in and to the mark "Rockwood" or any
trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade dress, logos, corporate names,
domain names and other source identifiers, emblems, signs or insignia
containing or comprising the foregoing, including any mark confusingly similar
thereto or derivative thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "), and will
not at any time after the Closing market, promote, advertise or offer for sale
any products, goods or services utilizing any of the Seller Marks or otherwise
hold itself out as having any affiliation with Parent or any of its
Affiliates. Buyer agrees that if any of the Business Assets, including any
promotional materials or printed forms, bear the "Rockwood" name (or any
derivative thereof), Buyer shall, prior to distributing, selling or otherwise
making use of such Business Assets for the general public, remove, delete,
cover or render illegible the "Rockwood" name as it may appear on such
Business Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of six (6) months
after the Closing Date, Buyer may use any remaining inventory of materials,
including business cards, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials and other similar materials that include one or more of
the Seller Marks to the extent such materials were included in the Business
Assets as of the Closing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees against all Losses asserted against or imposed upon them as a
consequence of the use of the Seller Marks by Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) following the Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, make
the initial filing required to be made with the applicable Governmental
Authority to cause each Transferred Company whose name includes the name
"Rockwood" to change its name such that its name does not include the name
"Rockwood" and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to change any such
name as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees that, after the Closing, neither Parent nor its Affiliates
shall (i) have any rights in and to any trademarks, trade names, service
marks, trade dress, logos, corporate names, domain names of any of the
Transferred Companies and other source identifiers, emblems, signs or insignia
related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing, including any mark
or term confusingly similar thereto or derivative thereof, but excluding the
Seller Marks (collectively, the " _Company Marks_ "); or (ii) market, promote,
advertise or offer for sale any products, goods or services utilizing any of
the Company Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having any affiliation with
Buyer, the Transferred Companies or any of their Affiliates.

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, (i) Parent will give
prompt notice in writing to Buyer of any event, change, effect, circumstance
or development of which it has Knowledge, or of which it receives notice, that

expected to be terminated for any reason, whether by a Transferred Company or
by such Key Employee (B) has had or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, taken together with any other event, change,

or could reasonably be expected to cause any of Parents representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be untrue

Affiliates related to this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate; (B) has had or could be reasonably

result, in the failure to satisfy any one or more of the condition specified

otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice, or the representations or warranties of, the indemnification
obligations of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereto.

 



 

4.8 _Retention of Books and Records_. Subject to the terms of this Section
4.8, Buyer will retain, and cause the Transferred Companies to retain, for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, all material financial
and tax-related books, records and other documents pertaining to the Business
in existence on the Closing Date and in possession of the Transferred
Companies as of the Closing Date and to make the same available after the
Closing Date for examination and copying by Parent or its Representatives, at
Parents expense, upon reasonable notice and for a reasonable purpose. Buyer
agrees that no such books, records or documents will be destroyed by Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) until the later of (i)
seven (7) years following the Closing Date, (ii) the expiration of the statute
of limitations for the assessment of Taxes in the jurisdiction to which such

4.9 _Permits_. Buyer shall be responsible for effecting all updates and
amendments and reissuances of Permits required in connection with or as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate, with Buyer in effecting such updates, amendments
and reissuances.

 



 

4.10 _Intercompany Agreements_. As of the Closing, all Business Agreements and
transactions between Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) on the one hand, and the Transferred Companies on the other hand
(other than the Business Agreements or other transactions listed on _Schedule
4.10 of the Disclosure Letter_ ), will either be terminated or amended to
remove or replace the applicable Transferred Company or Affiliate of Parent,
as the case may be, as a party to such agreement, as applicable, without
further liability to Buyer and its Affiliates (including any Transferred
Company) with respect to periods following the Closing.

 



 

4.11 _Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.11(b), at or prior to the Closing, Parent
shall cause each Transferred Company to pay, discharge, compromise, settle,
terminate or otherwise satisfy or cause to be paid, discharged, compromised,
settled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in full all Intercompany
Indebtedness and all Third-Party Indebtedness as well as all Encumbrances
related thereto. Parent shall obtain customary debt payoff letters and related
ancillary documents in respect of Third-Party Indebtedness, including evidence
of the release of all Encumbrances related thereto and evidence that notice of
such repayment or release has been timely delivered to the holders of such
Third-Party Indebtedness. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may cause
Third-Party Indebtedness to remain outstanding up to an aggregate amount of
$16.0 million.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.11(a):

 



 

(i) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness owed by a Transferred
Company to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (other than another Transferred
Company), if requested by Buyer in the manner described below, Parent shall
cause such Intercompany Indebtedness to remain outstanding if Buyer agrees to
purchase such Intercompany Indebtedness at face value at Closing (it being
understood that the total Purchase Price for the Shares and Intercompany
Indebtedness shall be the same as the Purchase Price for the Shares would have
been if the Intercompany Indebtedness were not purchased by Buyer).

 



 

(ii) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness owed by a Transferred
Company to another Transferred Company, if requested by Buyer in the manner
described below, Parent shall cause such Intercompany Indebtedness to remain
outstanding (it being understood that such Intercompany Indebtedness shall not
reduce the Purchase Price).

 



 

Within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall provide
Buyer with a schedule of Intercompany Indebtedness, and within 45 days after
receipt thereof (but in no event less than 10 Business Days before the Closing
Date), Buyer shall provide Parent with a schedule identifying any Intercompany
Indebtedness that it requests remain outstanding (" _Identified_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Indebtedness_ "). Following the initial identification pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform
Buyer of any new Intercompany Indebtedness and any changes to any existing
Identified Indebtedness and provide Buyer with an opportunity not later than
twenty-one (21) days prior to the Closing Date to add any new Intercompany
Indebtedness to, or remove any previously Identified Indebtedness from, its
schedule of Identified Indebtedness. Buyer shall be required to make any such
additions at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

4.12 _Credit Support_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
Closing, except to the extent Buyer consents in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall not provide any Credit
Support to the Business, except for (i) replacements of Credit Support
existing on the date of this Agreement or extensions of the term thereof, (ii)
Credit Support required to be provided under Legal Requirements, (iii) Credit
Support required to be provided pursuant to Business Agreements or Credit
Support existing on the date of this Agreement, (iv) unsecured Credit Support
for an amount, individually or in the aggregate, not exceeding $10.0 million,
or (v) any Sec. 303 AktG Security.

 



 

(b) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide Buyer with an updated _Schedule 2.23 of the Disclosure Letter_
that sets forth all of the Credit Support reasonably expected to be
outstanding as of the Closing Date. Parent and its Affiliates shall keep in
effect and maintain all of the Credit Support as of the Closing Date until the
earlier of (i) the date the applicable Credit Support is released or replaced
by Buyer or (ii) the date that is the ninetieth (90th) day following the
Closing Date. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
on or before the Closing Date (to the extent Parent so requests), and in any
event within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the release or
replacement of each of the obligations of Parent (or any Affiliate thereof,
other than the Transferred Companies) to provide Credit Support in respect of
any liability of any Transferred Company set forth on such updated _Schedule
2.23 of the Disclosure Letter_. To the extent Buyer does not obtain any such
release or replacement, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent in
respect of any liability or expense incurred by Parent (or any Affiliate
thereof, other than the Transferred Companies) in respect of any claim made in
respect of any such liability or expense arising or incurred after the Closing
Date. To the extent any creditor of any Transferred Company requests that
Parent or any of its Affiliates grant any Credit Support under Section 303 of
the AktG for any liabilities or obligations of any such Transferred Company
(other than in respect of Parent Covered Losses (as defined in _Schedule 8.9
of the Disclosure Letter_ )) to such creditor, which Credit Support will
remain in effect following the Closing (a " _Sec. 303 AktG Security_ "), Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Sec. 303 AktG
Security effective as of the Closing as requested by such creditor and have
such creditor simultaneously release Parent or any of its Affiliates from its
obligation to provide such Sec. 303 AktG Security (" _Security Replacement_
"). In the event Buyer cannot obtain such Security Replacement within thirty
(30) days after the Parent of any of its Affiliates has given written notice
to Buyer of any security request, Parent or its respective Affiliate shall be
entitled but not obliged to grant such Sec. 303 AktG Security and Buyer shall
hold harmless and indemnify Parent or the relevant Affiliate from any payment
made pursuant to any such Sec. 303 AktG Security.

 



      
 

 



 

4.13 _Title Insurance_. Prior to Closing, upon request of Buyer, Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in any efforts of Buyer to obtain title
insurance in respect of the Owned Real Property. Such cooperation will include
the execution of such instruments reasonably requested to enable Buyer to
obtain such insurance and desired endorsements; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall not be
required to execute any instrument which expands in any way the
representations and warranties contained herein or the liabilities of Parent
hereunder (for purposes of this Agreement, any instrument executed by the
Transferred Companies pursuant to this Section 4.13 shall be deemed to have
been executed and delivered following the Closing). The premiums for any such
title insurance will be Buyers responsibility.

 



 

4.14 _Restructurings; Augusta Related Activities_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause the Restructurings to be consummated in accordance with
_Schedule A-2 of the Disclosure Letter_ and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate the Restructurings prior to the date the Closing would
otherwise be required to occur pursuant to this Agreement without giving
effect to the conditions to the consummation of the Closing set forth in
Section 5.5. All liabilities, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any and
all Taxes, in connection with the Restructurings shall be Parents
responsibility. For the avoidance of doubt, as part of the Restructurings,
Parent shall cause its Affiliates (i) to transfer the ownership of all
Business Assets located at the Leased Sites to the Transferred Companies (or,
upon Buyers reasonable request, at Closing to Buyer or its designated
Affiliates); and (ii) exclude the Retained Sites and the Retained Companies
from the Assets of the Transferred Companies.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue with the
Augusta Related Activities that would be taken by a reasonable and prudent
operator that has not entered into an agreement to sell the Business. Except
for any liabilities included in the final determination of Closing Working
Capital, all liabilities, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all
Taxes, payable prior to Closing (or in the case of Taxes, incurred prior to
the Closing) in connection with the Augusta Related Activities shall be
Parents responsibility.

 



 

4.15 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable Legal
Requirements, that for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date,
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any Business Employee who is or has
been employed by any of the Transferred Companies, at, or at any time within
one (1) year prior to, the time of the act of solicitation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) general solicitations, such as through newspaper
advertisements, not directed at any Business Employees, will not be deemed to
violate this Section 4.15(a); and (ii) this Section 4.15(a) shall not apply to
any Business Employee whose employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Transferred Companies, is terminated by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees, to the maximum extent not violative of applicable Legal
Requirements, that for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date,
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, engage in the
Business in any country (the " _Restricted_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Territory_ ") in which the Business conducts operations as of the Closing
Date (the " _Restricted Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall be construed to prevent Parent or its Affiliates from (i)
acquiring or owning, directly or indirectly, for investment purposes only,
less than 5% of outstanding equity securities issued by any Person which
Person (A) is publicly traded or listed on any stock exchange or automated
quotation system and (B) engages, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted
Business in the Restricted Territory; (ii) acquiring any Entity or business
that, directly or indirectly, engages in the Restricted Business in the
Restricted Territory if less than 10% of the aggregate net revenue derived
from the Business in the most recent complete fiscal year of such acquired
Entity or business (calculated on a consolidated basis) was attributable to
the Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory; (iii) conducting any
business conducted by them on the date of this Agreement (other than those
conducted through the Transferred Companies); or (iv) performing their
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document. In the event
Parent acquires, to the extent permitted by clause (ii) above, an Entity or
business that, directly or indirectly, engages in the Restricted Business in
the Restricted Territory, Parent will use, or will cause its applicable
Affiliate to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to dispose of such
portion of such Entity or business to the extent that it engages in the
Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory within twelve (12) months of
the consummation of such acquisition by Parent or such Affiliate. For a period
of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Parent will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, refrain from making, causing to be made, any public statement
or announcement that disparages the Business or any director of a Transferred
Company or any Key Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not prevent the making of any factual statement as required by any Legal
Requirement, any valid Order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any
Proceeding.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the restrictions set
forth in Sections 4.15(a) and 4.15(b) will apply only to Parent Guarantor,
Parent and Entities "controlled by" (as such term is defined in the definition
of the term " _Affiliate_ ") Parent Guarantor or Parent, and shall not apply
to any third Person or the Affiliates of such third Person (other than Parent
and any Entities "controlled" by Parent Guarantor) that acquires Parent or any
Entities "controlled" by Parent Guarantor, whether as a result of a merger,
consolidation, other business combination, or acquisition of all or
substantially all of its assets or business.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this
Section 4.15 are reasonable in geographical and temporal scope and in all
other respects. The covenants contained in this Section 4.15 relate to matters
which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and any violation
of these covenants would cause substantial and irreparable injury to Buyer,
the amount of which would be impossible to estimate or determine and which
cannot be adequately compensated. Parent acknowledges that Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement without Parents commitment in binding itself
and its Affiliates to these covenants. Therefore, in the event of a breach or
a threatened breach by Parent or any of its Affiliates of these covenants,
Buyer will be entitled to an injunction restraining Parent or such Affiliate
from such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy as a remedy of money damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to injunctive relief will not be construed as prohibiting Buyer from
pursuing or obtaining any other available remedies, whether at law or in
equity, for such breach or threatened breach. The injunctive relief provided
for in this Section 4.15(d) is in addition to the relief provided for in
Section 10.9.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any court determines that any provision (or part thereof) included in
this Section 4.15 is unenforceable, such court will have the power to reduce
the duration or scope of such provision (or part thereof) or otherwise reform
such provision (or part thereof) and, as the case may be, in reduced or
reformed form, such provision shall be enforceable; it is the intention of the
parties hereto that the foregoing restrictions shall not be terminated, but
shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render them valid and
enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
this Agreement in the jurisdiction of the court that has made the
adjudication.

 



 

4.16 _Cooperation in Litigation_. Buyer and Parent shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with each other at the
requesting partys expense in the prosecution or defense of any claim or
Proceeding arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and involving one or more third Persons. The party requesting such
cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
by the party providing such cooperation and by its Representatives, but shall
not be responsible for reimbursing such party or its Representatives for their
time spent in such cooperation.

 



 

4.17 _Assistance_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer will (and will cause the Transferred Companies
and its other Affiliates to) reasonably assist Parent and its Affiliates in
preparing information for various Governmental Authorities or other third
Persons after the Closing to the extent that such information relates to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Business, the Business Assets
and/or the liabilities of the Business. Such information includes, but is not
limited to, information required by Parent and its Affiliates to (i) comply
with their financial reporting requirements and (ii) to submit any claims that
would reasonably be expected to be covered under the insurance policies of
Parent or its Affiliates or their respective self-insurance programs in
respect of events, circumstances and occurrences prior to Closing. Parent
shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(excluding internal costs) actually incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in
connection with the compliance by Buyer with its obligations under this
Section 4.17(a).

 



 

(b) After the Closing, Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
reasonably assist Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) in preparing information for various Governmental Authorities or
other third Persons after the Closing to the extent that such information
relates to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Business, the
Business Assets and/or the liabilities of the Business. Such information shall
include information required by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) to (i) comply with their financial reporting
requirements and (ii) to submit any claims that would reasonably be expected
to be covered under the insurance policies of Buyer or its Affiliates or their
respective self-insurance programs in respect of events, circumstances and
occurrences after the Closing. Buyer shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (excluding internal costs) actually incurred
by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the compliance by Parent with
its obligations under this Section 4.17(b).

 



      
 

 



 

4.18 _Further Assurances_. At any time after the Closing, Parent and Buyer
will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly execute,
acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents reasonably requested
by Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, to satisfy or in connection with their
obligations hereunder or to consummate or implement the transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.19 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred Companies
shall cease to be insured by Parents or Parents Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) insurance policies or by any of Parents or Parents
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) self-insured programs. For
the avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall
retain all rights to control its insurance policies and programs, including
the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and programs,
notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to any liabilities
of Buyer or the Transferred Companies. Prior to and after the Closing, Parent
and its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing Date, the Transferred
Companies) shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to assist Buyer in obtaining
replacement insurance policies for the Transferred Companies and the Business,
including any tail insurance policies. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Transferred Companies to, reasonably cooperate with
respect to any claims made by Parent with respect to the Business or the
Business Assets prior to the Closing.

 



 

4.20 _Privileged Matters; Waiver of Conflicts_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the information relating to or arising out of the legal advice
or services that have been or will be provided prior to the Closing Date for
the benefit of both Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) and the Transferred Companies shall be subject to a shared
privilege between Parent, on the one hand, and the Transferred Companies, on
the other hand, and Parent and the Transferred Companies shall have equal
right to assert all such shared privileges in connection with privileged
information under any applicable Legal Requirements and no such shared
privilege may be waived by (a) Parent without the prior written consent of
Buyer or (b) by Buyer or any Transferred Company without the prior written
consent of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information relating to
or arising out of any legal advice or services provided, whether before or
after the Closing Date, with respect to any matter for which an Indemnifying
Party has an indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be subject to the
sole and separate privilege of such Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver of all such
separate privileges under any applicable Legal Requirements in connection with
any privileged information, whether or not such information is in the
possession of or under the control of any Indemnified Party. Buyer, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Transferred Companies, hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any representation
of the Transferred Companies by Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP, Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP and Waselius and Wist prior to the Closing, such law firms may,
following the Closing, represent Parent and its Affiliates in any matter
(including with respect to Proceedings arising under or with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and on behalf of itself,
its Affiliates and, following the Closing, the Transferred Companies, Buyer
hereby irrevocably waives any conflicts arising out of such representation.

 



      
 

 



 

4.21 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. Parent shall keep confidential, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to keep confidential, all information
relating to the Business, the Transferred Companies or the Non-Controlled
Companies (" _Confidential Information_ "), except (a) with the prior written
consent of Buyer; (b) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Legal
Requirements, including federal securities laws, the valid Order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or any Proceeding, in which event, to the extent
permitted by such Legal Requirement, Order or Proceeding, Parent shall notify
Buyer as promptly as practicable (and, if possible, prior to the making of
such disclosure); (c) to the extent such Confidential Information is available
to the public through no fault of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent; (d) to
the extent such Confidential Information becomes available after the Closing
Date to Parent or any of its Affiliates from a third Person who is under no
confidential or fiduciary obligation to Buyer or its Affiliates with respect
to such Confidential Information; (e) to the extent Parent can demonstrate
that such Confidential Information was independently developed by Parent or
its Affiliates after the Closing Date without violating this Section 4.21; or
(f) to the extent such Confidential Information is used in the enforcement of
any of the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or
the other Ancillary Documents or in the defense of any Proceeding brought
against Parent or one of its Affiliates. The obligations of Parent pursuant to
this Section 4.21 shall cease five (5) years following the Closing, except
that such obligations shall survive indefinitely in respect of Confidential
Information that are trade secrets, proprietary information and know-how of
the Business, the Transferred Companies or the Non-Controlled Companies.

 



 

4.22 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates
to provide, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Parents and its Affiliates Representatives to provide, all reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary in connection with Buyers
efforts to obtain the Financing, including (i) reasonable cooperation in
connection with the marketing efforts reasonably necessary for the Financing;
(ii) participation by senior management of the Transferred Companies in, and
assistance with, the preparation of a reasonable number of rating agency
presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer and its Financing Sources the Financing
Information as promptly as practicable after the date hereof; (iv) reasonable
participation by senior management of the Transferred Companies in the

(c) no claim for indemnification may be made (i) by a Buyer Indemnitee

Date;

 



 

(d) Parent shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2(a): (i) for any

the cumulative aggregate amount of the Losses with respect to such matter or
series of related matters arising out of the same facts or circumstances

indemnification would otherwise be available under Section 8.2(g) exceeds 1.0%
of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Environmental Deductible_ "), after which

inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.14

(h) Parent shall have no liability under Section 8.2(d) with respect to the

required under a Lease Agreement; or (ii) under Section 8.2 to the extent

surface unless necessary to properly isolate the underground structure from
the operating portions of the facility); and (C) any construction of new
facilities or modification of any existing facility or structure but not
environmental sampling facilities other than sampling that would be performed
by a reasonable and prudent operator acting without the benefit of
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case (1) Buyer shall
provide written notice to Parent at least thirty (30) days prior to such
activity with information sufficient to enable Parent reasonably to evaluate
the extent and nature of the contemplated disturbance of the property; (2)
Parent shall have thirty (30) days in which to provide Buyer with comments and

any expense related to management or employee time (whether opportunity costs,
direct costs or otherwise).

 



 

(k) For purposes of Section 8.2(d) with respect to the Leased Sites, Losses
shall not include (i) any Losses arising primarily from any change in use of
the Real Property by Buyer after the Closing (including an increase in
capacity of the facilities or structures thereon) other than as required under
a Lease Agreement; (ii) any Loss resulting primarily from any increase in,
worsening of or other adverse change in any Environmental Condition that
arises from any act or omission attributable to Buyer or any Transferred
Company (or their Representatives) following the Closing; (iii) any Loss
resulting from any Environmental Condition caused or created by Buyer or its
Representatives, or that arises from Buyers operation of the Business or a
change in Legal Requirements applicable thereto (except as it relates to Pre-
Closing Environmental Conditions), in each case, during the term of the
applicable Lease Agreement; and (iv) any cost and expense related to Buyers
management or employee time (whether opportunity costs, direct costs or
expenses, or otherwise).

 



 

(l) Buyer and Parent shall each take, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take, all reasonable measures consistent with the safe and
prudent operation of the applicable property to mitigate any Loss for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder promptly upon a responsible officer or
employee of an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates becoming aware of such
Loss, and neither Buyer nor Parent shall be liable for any Loss to the extent
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could have mitigated such Loss by
taking measures consistent with the safe and prudent operation of the
applicable property after a responsible officer or employee of such

(m) The Seller Indemnitees shall have no recourse against any Transferred
Company, their Affiliates or their respective Representatives, assigns or
successors for any indemnification claim asserted by a Buyer Indemnitee.

 



 

8.5 _Recovery from Third Persons_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VIII (before giving effect to
the other limitations on indemnification set forth in this Article VIII) shall
be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (or any
Affiliate thereof) under insurance policies, or otherwise actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) from other Persons not
affiliated with the Indemnified Party (in each case, net of any costs,
expenses or Taxes incurred for the recovery of such amounts with respect to
such Loss. Buyer and Parent each agree that, unless the other party shall
otherwise direct in writing, it will (and cause its Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover, without instituting any
Proceeding, any such amounts to the extent such recoveries would reduce
amounts required to be paid by the other party pursuant to this Article VIII.

 



 

8.6 _Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Any claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 will be
made in accordance with this Section 8.6. In the case of any claim for
indemnification arising from a claim or demand of a third Person (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice, and in
any event no more than fifteen (15) Business Days following

 



      
 

 



 

such Indemnified Partys receipt of written notice of such Third-Party Claim,
to the Indemnifying Party describing with reasonable specificity to the extent
known the basis of such Third-Party Claim as to which it may request
indemnification hereunder and must be made to the extent it is made under
Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(g) or 8.3(a) in accordance with Section 8.4(c);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to notify or delay in notifying an
Indemnifying Party as provided in this sentence or the next sentence will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to Sections 8.2 or
8.3, as applicable, except to the extent that such failure causes material
harm to the Indemnifying Party. Any claim for indemnification that does not
result from a Third-Party Claim will be made by written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable after the time the Indemnified
Party becomes aware of the facts forming the basis of such claim, which notice
(i) will describe the facts or events giving rise to such claim with
reasonable specificity to the extent known, and (ii) must be made to the
extent it is made under Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(g) or 8.3(a) in accordance with
Section 8.4(c). The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its sole
expense, to defend and to direct the defense against, and to manage and
settle, any Third-Party Claim, in its name or in the name of the Indemnified
Party, with counsel or other Representatives selected by the Indemnifying
Party (such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense if (A) the Losses that may be incurred as a result of such Third-Party
Claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the liability limitations set
forth in Section 8.4(a), individually or together with all outstanding Third-
Party Claim and other claims by the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII;
(B) such Third-Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party; or (C) such Third-Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect Buyers ongoing or future
business, other than in the case of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Sections
8.2(d) and 8.2(e). . If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim, it shall
within fifteen (15) Business Days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third-Party
Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate or settle any
Third-Party Claim, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election as
herein provided, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
defends, negotiates or settles any Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party from time to time for the costs
and expenses in connection therewith upon submission of invoices. The
Indemnifying Party may not settle or compromise any such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if as a result
thereof injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and make available its officers and employees and relevant files and
records (and those of its Affiliates), and the Indemnifying Party agrees to
promptly provide the Indemnified Party with such information as to the defense
of any such Third-Party Claim as the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
request. The Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice
employed by it at the expense of the Indemnified Party and will have the
right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all cross-claims and
counterclaims it may have; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists
between the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects not to
defend against, negotiate or settle any Third-Party Claim, fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or fails to defend,
contest or otherwise protect against the imposition of any such damages as to
any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to defend, contest or assert any cross-claim or
counterclaim or otherwise protect against such Third-Party Claim and may make
any compromise or settlement thereof and recover from and be indemnified by
the Indemnifying Party for the entire reasonable cost thereof, including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(1) the Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification obligations with
respect to any such Third-Party Claim or demand which is settled by the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
and (2) the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one
such counsel in each affected jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.6 to the contrary, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the prior written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any Order unless the Third-Party Claim
claimant provides to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the subject matter of the Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(c) In the event any Proceeding is brought in respect of this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Documents, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover
reasonable expenses and fees and disbursements of counsel and other costs
incurred in such Proceeding, in addition to any relief to which such party may
be entitled.

 



 

8.7 _Further Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, except with respect (i) to matters covered by
Section 1.5, Section 1.6 and Section 4.27 and (ii) breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 10.15 and 10.16, in each
case, the rights of the parties under Section 4.15(d), this Article VIII,
Article IX and Section 10.9 will be the exclusive remedy of the parties with
respect to any claims (other than claims arising from fraud) a party may have
against the other party or such other partys Affiliates or Representatives or
the Financing Sources under, relating to or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 8.7 shall
limit or modify any rights of either party to seek or obtain specific
performance or specific enforcement of, or other injunctive or equitable
relief in respect of, any provision of this Agreement, or to seek any remedy
on account of any Persons fraudulent conduct.

 



 

(b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and after
the Closing, the Transferred Companies) and its and their respective
Representatives, effective upon Closing, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, hereby waives and releases Parent and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) and its and their respective
Representatives from any statutory or other rights of contribution or
indemnity (except as set forth in Section 1.5, Section 1.6, this Article VIII,
Article IX and Section 10.9 and claims and causes of action arising from fraud
and claims or causes of action with respect to any breach

 



      
 

 



 

of any covenant or agreement to be performed after the Closing) with respect
to Parents ownership of the Shares, the Subsidiary Shares, the Minority
Interests or control or operation of, or otherwise relating to, the
Transferred Companies and the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer is
not releasing any claims related to the enforcement of this Agreement. Buyer
consents to the execution by the Transferred Companies prior to or at the
Closing of an instrument by which they agree to be bound by the provisions of
(and in any event waive and release those matters specified in) this Section
8.7(b) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. Buyer
will take (and will cause the Transferred Companies to take) such actions
following the Closing as Parent shall reasonably require (including the taking
of corporate action and the execution of instruments and confirmatory
documentation) in order to implement and give effect to the provisions of this
Section 8.7(b).

 



 

(c) In the event that an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party will,
upon payment of such indemnity, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Party with respect to claims to which such indemnification relates, except to
the extent such subrogation would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect Buyers ongoing or future business.

 



 

(d) Except (i) for the rights and remedies in respect of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents, (ii) with regard to those items listed on _Schedule
4.10 of the Disclosure Letter_ or (iii), with respect to any director, officer
or employee of a Transferred Company, in order to recover compensation paid to
such director, officer or employee for any breaches or violations of the
Rockwood Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or similar policies, effective
upon the Closing, Parent on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
Parent Guarantor and Sellers, but excluding the Transferred Companies) hereby
fully, finally and forever releases, discharges and covenants not to sue and
otherwise agrees not to enforce any claim, cause of action, right, title or
interest against, any Transferred Company and each director, officer and
employee of each Transferred Company and their respective successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Released Persons_ "), with respect to
any and all claims, debts, covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities,
actions or demands of any kind or character, based upon any fact or
circumstance, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which
presently exists or has ever existed in the past, that any of Parent, or its
Affiliates (including the Sellers) have or may have in any manner whatsoever,
either singly or jointly with others against any of the Released Persons.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article VIII shall
have no application with respect to indemnification for Taxes, which shall be
covered exclusively by Sections 9.1 and 9.2.

 



 

8.8 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to
this Article VIII shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, except to the extent otherwise required by Legal
Requirements following a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code.

 



 

8.9 _Covered Losses_. The parties agree that, following the Closing Date, the
responsibility of the parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to
Covered Losses shall be as set forth on _Schedule 8.9 of the Disclosure
Letter_.

 



      
 

 



 

 _ARTICLE IX_

 



 

 _TAX AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS_

 



 

9.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) (i) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, at the
request of Parent, Buyer shall cooperate with Parent in making any elections
or taking any other actions that will result in any taxable periods of the
Transferred Companies that begin prior to the Closing Date ending on or prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Parent will cause to be prepared and filed all Income Tax Returns
(including any consolidated, unitary or combined Income Tax Returns) required
to be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (any such period, a " _Pre-Closing
Period_ "). Parent will include (or cause to be included) (i) the income of
the U.S. Transferred Companies and any of their Subsidiaries in the
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns filed by Parent, and (ii) the income
of a German Transferred Company of a year, in which it was a member of a
German tax group _(Organschaft)_ with respect to such income, in the tax
return of the common parent of such German tax group, in each case for all
taxable years of the relevant companies ending on or before the Closing Date
Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns other than Income
Tax Returns (any such Tax Returns, " _Non-Income Tax Returns_ ") required to
be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for any Pre-Closing Period
that are due after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) drafts of
any such Non-Income Tax Returns (other than monthly returns for VAT, wage tax
and social security) shall be provided to Parent for its review and comment at
least thirty (30) days prior to filing and the parties will use all reasonable
efforts to resolve any dispute with respect to such Non-Income Tax Returns,
but, if such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties within fifteen (15)
days after Buyer receives notice of such dispute, it shall be referred to the
Selected Accountant, (B) such Non-Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements or a change in circumstances and (C) Parent may
assume responsibility for preparing any such Non-Income Tax Returns (other
than monthly returns for VAT, wage tax and social security) upon notice to
Buyer at least thirty (30) days before any such Non-Income Tax Return is due.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period
without Parents consent, except to the extent there would be no potential
current or future Tax liability or other cost to Parent or any of its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the above provisions, (A) drafts of Non-Income Tax
Returns in relation to French Taxes shall be provided to Parent for its review
and comments at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing (or seven (7) days
prior to the date when the filing becomes due if the aforesaid fifteen (15)
day period cannot reasonably be satisfied) and the parties will use all
reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute in relation thereof, but if such
dispute cannot be resolved by the parties two (2) days before the date when
the filing becomes due, it shall be referred to the Selected Accountant; and
(B) with respect to Income Tax Returns of Viance required to be filed after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall control the actions of CSI with respect to the
preparation and filing of such

 



       
 

 



 

Income Tax Returns based on the instructions of Parent, provided that Parent
and Buyer agree that with respect to any Pre-Closing Period, if requested by
Buyer, CSI shall cause Viance to make an election under Section 754 of the
Code or any similar provision of state Income Tax law; _provided_ that Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates on a Net After-Tax
Basis from any Losses incurred as a result of any such election.

 



 

(iii) Following the Closing, Parent will pay, and will indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis,
(A) any and all Seller Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period and (B) any and all
Taxes or other Losses (other than any expenses incurred by Buyer with respect
to claims for which Parent is exercising its right to control pursuant to this
Article IX) resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty in
Section 2.7 (for these purposes the Parties agree that "Material," as used in
Section 2.7 means material in the context of the subject Taxes), except to the
extent such representation or warranty relates to the United States federal
Income Tax attributes (including asset basis, earnings and profits, and
foreign taxes) of a Transferred Company organized outside of the United
States; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax
Basis, any Seller Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period imposed as a result of (x)
any action outside the ordinary course of business effected after the Closing
by Buyer or its Affiliates (including by the Transferred Companies), (y) any
Tax election made after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates (including by
the Transferred Companies), except for any such election directed by Parent or
set forth in this Agreement or (z) the breach by Buyer of any of its covenants
hereunder. To the extent that the accrued liability with respect to any such
Seller Taxes included in the calculation of the final Closing Working Capital
exceeds the actual liability, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to
pay such excess to Parent within fifteen (15) days after filing the relevant
Tax Return for such Pre-Closing Tax Period. Parents and Buyers payment
obligations pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall become due on the date
on which Buyer or its Affiliates, or Parent and its Affiliates, have to pay
the respective Taxes.

 



 

(b) (i) Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed by or on behalf of any Transferred Company for any taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (any such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) drafts of any such Tax
Returns (other than monthly returns for VAT, wage tax and social security, and
sales Tax and similar Taxes) shall be provided to Parent for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to filing, and the parties will use
all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax
Returns, but, if such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties within fifteen
(15) days after Buyer receives notice of such dispute, it shall be referred to
the Selected Accountant for resolution and (B) such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the last Tax Returns previously filed by
the Transferred Companies, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements or a change in circumstances or as otherwise consented to by
Parent. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a Straddle Period
without Parents written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the above provisions, drafts of French
Tax Returns (other than monthly returns

 



      
 

 



 

for VAT, wage tax and social security, and sales Tax and similar Taxes) in
relation to the Straddle Period shall be provided to Parent for its review and
comments at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing (or seven (7) days prior
to the date when the filing becomes due if the aforesaid fifteen (15) day
period cannot reasonably be satisfied) and the parties will use all reasonable
efforts to resolve any dispute in relation thereof, but if such dispute cannot
be resolved by the parties two (2) days before the date when the filing
becomes due, it shall be referred to the Selected Accountant.

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis with respect to the Assets or capital of a Transferred
Company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in property Taxes, be deemed
to be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period
and (B) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed to be equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on and included
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances and
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as depreciation
deductions) shall be prorated between the portion of the applicable Straddle
Period that ends on and includes the Closing Date and the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number
of days in each period.

 



 

(iii) Parent will, within fifteen (15) days after the date on which the
Straddle Period Tax Return is filed, reimburse Buyer for, and will indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-
Tax Basis, any Seller Taxes for any Straddle Period, except to the extent such
Seller Taxes for a Straddle Period are imposed as a result of (A) any action
outside the ordinary course of business after the Closing effected by Buyer or
its Affiliates (including by the Transferred Companies), (B) any Tax election
made after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates (including by the
Transferred Companies), except for any such election directed by Parent or set
forth in this Agreement or (C) the breach by Buyer of any of its covenants
hereunder. Any Taxes (including estimated Taxes) paid prior to the Closing or
reflected as a liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital with
respect to any Straddle Period shall be credited against Parents liability
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(iii) and, to the extent such Taxes paid prior
to the Closing and the accrued liability with respect to any such Seller Taxes
included in the calculation of the final Closing Working Capital exceed
Parents actual liability, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to pay
such excess to Parent within fifteen (15) days after filing the relevant Tax
Return for such Straddle Period.

 



 

(iv) Parent shall cause the French Seller and the French Companies to
terminate the French Tax Sharing Agreement with effect as of the Closing Date
and, prior to the Closing, enter into a Tax sharing termination agreement with
effect as of the Closing Date (the " _French Tax Sharing Termination
Agreement_ "). Without prejudice to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above, the
French Tax Sharing Termination Agreement shall

 



      
 

 



 

notably provide that (A) the French Seller will pay (and that Parent will
cause the French Seller to pay) installments of French corporation tax due by
the French Companies in respect of the Straddle Period to the French Treasury
and (B) that the French Companies will reimburse the French Seller for
installments of the Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, any
Taxes of the Transferred Companies for periods beginning after the Closing
Date and any Taxes of the Transferred Companies for the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Parent will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Buyer or
any Transferred Company of, any refund or credit for overpayment of Income
Taxes for which Parent (including by way of offset) is responsible pursuant to
Sections 9.1(a) or (b) plus any interest received with respect thereto from
the relevant taxing authorities, but only to the extent such refund or credit
was not included as a current asset in the determination of the final Closing
Working Capital. Buyer will, if Parent so requests and at Parents expense,
cause the Transferred Companies to promptly file for and obtain any refunds or
credits to which Parent is entitled under this Section 9.1(d). Buyer will
permit Parent to control (at Parents expense) the prosecution of any such
claim for refund and, when deemed appropriate by Parent, will cause the
relevant Entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney such person as
Parent may designate to represent such Entity with respect to such refund
claimed. For purposes of this Section 9.1(d), a party will be deemed to have
made prompt payment of a refund or credit if such payment is made within ten
(10) days of the receipt by such party of such refund or of the use by such
party of such credit.

 



 

(e) If and to the extent that any audit or other adjustment to a Tax Return
filed by or on behalf of a Transferred Company for a Pre-Closing Period
results in an increase in any Tax liability for which Parent is responsible
pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b) (including any liability with respect to a
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax) and a corresponding Tax benefit to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) for any
taxable period or portion thereof following the Closing Date (including as a
result of income having been accelerated from a period following the Closing
Date to a Pre-Closing Period or deductions or credits being deferred from a
Pre-Closing Period to a period following the Closing, or increased
depreciation or amortization deductions being allowed following the Closing),
Buyer shall pay over to Parent an amount equal to any resulting Tax savings
that are actually recognized during the period of five (5) years following the
Closing Date, as such Tax savings are recognized.

 



 

(f) Buyer will promptly notify Parent in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) of
notice of any pending or threatened audit or assessment with respect to Taxes
for which Parent would be required to pay or indemnify Buyer or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b). Parent will have the right to
control the Transferred Companies interest in any Proceeding relating to any
Pre-Closing Period (other than where such Proceeding also relates to a period
beginning after the Closing Date, in which case, the Proceeding shall be
controlled jointly by Buyer and Parent), including the right to control,
compromise and settle any such Proceeding, and to decide whether any consents
or waivers to extend applicable statutes of limitations will be granted, and
to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

not compromise or settle any such Proceeding without Buyers written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, if such
action would adversely affect the Transferred Companies liability in a manner
that is material in the context of the subject Taxes for any taxable period or
portion thereof following the Closing Date. Buyer and Parent shall jointly
control any Proceeding relating to any Straddle Period or both a Pre-Closing
Period and a period beginning after the Closing Date and neither Parent nor
Buyer shall compromise or settle any such Proceeding without the other partys
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 



 

(g) After the Closing Date, each of Buyer and Parent will provide the other,
and Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to provide to Parent, (subject
to reimbursement by the other party for any out-of-pocket expenses), with such
assistance, including access to the Transferred Companies, as may reasonably
be requested by the other party in connection with the preparation of any
return, report, or form with respect to Taxes or any audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding (such assistance to include assistance in data
collection and responses to information requests) relating to liability for
Taxes of the Transferred Companies or any affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group in which any of the Transferred Companies is included.

 



 

(h) To the extent that the purchase of the Shares by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement results in any documentary, stamp, transfer, sales, use, excise or
similar Taxes, including German real estate transfer Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_
") imposed upon Parent or Buyer or their respective Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies), 50% of such Transfer Taxes will be borne and paid by
Parent and 50% of such Transfer Taxes will be borne and paid by Buyer. The
parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under applicable Legal Requirements, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.
Any Tax Return that must be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local Legal Requirements for the filing of such Tax
Returns, and such party will provide the other party a true copy of such
return as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof and a receipt
showing payment of any Taxes owed. Within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which the relevant Tax Return is filed, the non-filing party shall reimburse
the filing party for its share of the Transfer Taxes with respect to such Tax
Return.

 



 

(i) Subject to Section 4.25 and to the French Tax Sharing Termination
Agreements, any Tax sharing agreement between Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Companies), on the one hand, and the Transferred
Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and
will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a
future year or a past year).

 



 

(j) Except for the payments and reimbursements of installments made in
relation to the Straddle Period that are aimed at under the French Tax Sharing
Termination Agreements and except to the extent required by Legal Requirements
following a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code, any
amount paid by or on behalf of any party to or on behalf of another party
pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) Parent shall be subrogated to any rights (including rights to
indemnification) that Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) may have against third parties with respect to Taxes paid or
indemnified by Parent pursuant to this Section 9.1.

 



 

(l) The indemnification obligations in this Section 9.1 shall survive until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnification obligations of Parent in
Section 9.1(a)(iii)(B) relating to a breach of a representation or warranty,
other than those representations or warranties in Sections 2.7(f), (g), (h),
(i), (m) and (o) (for the avoidance of doubt, indemnification for which shall
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations), shall survive until ninety (90) days after the due date for
filing (taking into account any applicable extensions) of the Tax Return for
the first taxable period ending after the Closing Date with respect to the
relevant Tax.

 



 

(m) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 9.1 only for
German Income Taxes, a Tax shall be attributable to a Pre-Closing Period if
such Tax relates to incorrect Tax balance sheets for periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date which have been corrected ( _Bilanzberichtigung_ )
with effect to Tax periods ending after the Closing Date due to the expiration
of the statute of limitations; provided, however, that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not voluntarily make any such corrections and Parent shall be
afforded rights comparable to those in Sections 9.1(a) and 9.1(f) with respect
to any such correction proposed by any Governmental Authority and this Section
9.1(m) shall not apply to any balance sheet correction (
_Bilanzberichtigungen_ ) made after the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date. With respect to any Balance Sheet correction to which this subclause
applies, Parent shall have the same rights as set forth in _Sections 9.1 (a)_
and 9.1(f).

 



 

(n) Sellers shall make all filings and reportings in the Peoples Republic of
China necessary under Guoshuihan 2009 No. 698 (" _Circular 698_ ") within the
specified time period set out in Circular 698 and shall, to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements, pay when due and payable any
amounts due in respect of the Tax arising as a result of the filing
contemplated by this subclause to the appropriate taxation authority of the
Peoples Republic of China.

 



 

(o) (i) Buyer and Parent agree that Buyer and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. shall
make a timely, irrevocable and effective election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code and any similar provision of state or local Legal Requirements (each,
a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_") with respect to the Buyers purchase of
the U.S. Transferred Companies that are classified as corporations for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes on the Closing Date, other than Sachtleben LLC. To
facilitate such elections, at the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Buyer an
IRS Form 8023 or successor form and any similar forms under state or local
Legal Requirements (each a " _Form 8023_") with respect to the Buyers
purchase of the U.S. Transferred Companies that are classified as corporations
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes on the Closing Date, which Forms 8023
shall have been duly executed by Rockwood Holdings, Inc. Buyer shall (A) cause
the applicable Form 8023 to be duly executed by an authorized person for
Buyer; (B) complete the schedules required to be attached thereto; (C) provide
a copy of the executed Form 8023 and schedules to Parent; and (D) duly and
timely file the Form 8023 as prescribed by Treasury

 



      
 

 



 

Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or applicable provision under state or local
Legal Requirements.

 



 

(ii) Buyer and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items constituting
consideration for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes among the Assets of the
companies for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made pursuant to Section
338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in a manner consistent
with _Schedule A-1 of the Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Tax Allocation_ "). If
Buyer and Parent reach an agreement with respect to the Tax Allocation, the
Tax Allocation shall be revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, assumed liabilities or other consideration paid, including
any adjustment pursuant to Section 1.5, in the manner provided by Section 338
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(iii) If Buyer and Parent reach an agreement with respect to the Tax
Allocation, Buyer and Parent shall file all Tax Returns and information
reports (including IRS Form 8883 or any other forms or reports required to be
filed pursuant to Section 338 of the Code or any comparable provisions of
state or local Legal Requirements) in a manner consistent with the Tax
Allocation, as finally determined, except as otherwise required by a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

(p) If necessary to prevent reduction in any Tax attributes of the U.S.
Transferred Companies under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d), Parent
and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall make an election under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce Parents or its Affiliates,
as applicable, tax basis in its shares of the relevant U.S. Transferred
Company to the extent necessary to prevent such reduction. If this election is
made, Parent and its Affiliates shall timely provide Buyer with a copy of the
Section 1.1502-36 statement filed with the applicable Tax Return in connection
with the election. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, Parent and its Affiliates and any relevant affiliated group
shall not elect pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B)
to retain any net operating or capital loss carryovers of the U.S. Transferred
Companies. To the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, relinquish pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Legal Requirements), with respect to all net operating losses
attributable to the U.S. Transferred Companies, the portion of the carryback
period for which the U.S. Transferred Companies were members of a consolidated
group of which Parent or any of its Affiliates is or was the common parent.

 



 

9.2 _Certain VAT Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Parent are of the opinion that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not subject to VAT and Buyer and Parent agree not to take
any action or cause to be taken that could reasonably be expected to cause VAT
to become due. Parent shall and shall procure that the Sellers undertake not
to opt to treat the transactions contemplated hereunder as being subject to
VAT (or other Tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction). To the extent that
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are subject to VAT (or any
other Tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction), Buyer shall pay, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, Sellers and each of their Affiliates from such VAT (or any other Tax
of a similar nature in any jurisdiction) in addition to the Purchase Price,
provided Buyer has received a proper invoice which complies with the
respective VAT provisions of the respective VAT code or applicable provisions
in other jurisdictions, but only to the extent such VAT (or such other Tax) is
not triggered by actions of Sellers that are not contemplated by this
Agreement. VAT (or any other Tax of a similar nature in any jurisdiction)
shall be payable by Buyer immediately upon receipt from the Sellers of an
invoice which complies with the respective VAT provisions of the respective
VAT Code or applicable provisions in other jurisdictions.

 



 

(b) With respect to the VAT fiscal unity ( _umsatzsteuerliche Organschaft_ )
between RSGG as the common parent company ( _Organtr ager_) and Sachtleben
Wasserchemie GmbH and Sachtleben Wasserchemie Holding GmbH as RSGGs
controlled entities ( _Organgesellschaft_ ) as well as Rockwood Specialties
GmbH as common parent company and Silo Pigmente GmbH and Rockwood Pigmente
GmbH as Rockwood Specialties GmbHs controlled entities (all controlled
entities being "Controlled VAT Members"), each common parent company and each
of its respective Controlled VAT Members shall, and the Buyer shall procure
that, the Controlled VAT Members will closely cooperate to ensure that (i) the
Controlled VAT Members will compensate their respective common parent company
for output VAT ( _Umsatzsteuer_ ) on supplies and services rendered until and
including the Closing Date and (ii) the common parent companies will
compensate their respective Controlled VAT Members for input VAT ( _Vorsteuer_
) on supplies and services received until and including the Closing Date
consistent with past practice up to the Closing Date, irrespective of whether
any of the aforementioned supplies or services have been accounted for by the
respective common parent company or Controlled VAT Member, as the case may be,
before or on the Closing Date or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.2 relates solely to those VAT
matters referred to herein and the provisions of Section 9.1 shall control
with respect to all other Tax matters, including any VAT matters other than
those referred to herein.

 



 

9.3 _General Labor and Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Transferred Companies shall withdraw from
participation in all Benefit Plans other than Transferred Company Benefit
Plans, and, except as provided in Sections 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies), shall continue to be
responsible for any Transferred Company Benefit Plans. From and after the
Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) shall
have no liability relating to any Benefit Plans or other employee benefit
plans other than the Transferred Company Benefit Plans, and Seller and its
Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates with
respect to any and all such liabilities.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause (i) the Remote Employees to cease to be employed by
Parent or its Affiliates, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) the Seller
Retained Employees to cease to be employed by the Transferred Companies prior
to or upon the Closing. Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make
an offer of employment, effective as of the Closing, to each Remote Employee.
Such offers of employment by Buyer (or its Subsidiaries) shall be made in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and shall offer salary
levels that are the

 



      
 

 



 

same as, and other terms of employment, that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to, those provided to the Remote Employees on the date hereof
and other terms of employment that are substantially comparable to those
provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer
shall provide that, at all times following the Closing, each Remote Employee
is credited with his or her service with Parent or its Affiliates for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (solely, in the case of benefit
accruals, for purposes of determining vacation and severance and as otherwise
may be required by any applicable Legal Requirements) for all service that was
recognized by Parent and its Affiliates under Benefit Plans with respect to
such Remote Employees under each of the comparable employee benefit plans,
programs or policies of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such employee becomes
or may become a participant, provided that no such service recognition shall
result in any duplication of benefits. Parent shall be solely responsible and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Transferred Companies and their
respective Affiliates from Losses relating to the terminations or transfers of
employment of Remote Employees and Seller Retained Employees described in this
Section 9.3(b), other than, in the case of the Remote Employees, as a result
of Buyers (or its Subsidiaries) failure to comply with its obligations as
set forth in this Section 9.3(b).

 



 

(c) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the full amount that may become due
or payable under, taking into account any forfeiture or cancellation in
accordance with the terms of, any transaction or retention incentives, bonuses
or awards made as a result or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Transaction Bonuses_ ") to Business Employees.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in Sections 9.3, 9.4 or 9.5, expressed or implied, shall
(i) confer upon any of the employees of Parent, Buyer, the Transferred
Companies or any of their Affiliates or representatives, any rights or
remedies, including any right to benefits or employment, or continued benefits
or employment, for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever by
reason of this Agreement; or (ii) be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit plan, program or Contract.

 



 

9.4 _U.S. Labor and Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the one year anniversary thereof
(the " _U.S. Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause the
appropriate Affiliate (other than with respect to any U.S. Business Employees
whose terms of employment are governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement)
to provide (i) a base salary or base wages to each U.S. Business Employee
whose employment continues following the Closing and whose terms of employment
are not subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement or other Contract or
obligation arising from such U.S. Business Employees representation by a
labor union (each a " _Continuing U.S. Employee_ ") at an annualized rate that
is no less than the annualized rate of the base salary or base wages that was
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii)
employee benefits to the Continuing U.S. Employees that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any Transaction
Bonuses, change-of-control or similar benefits). Effective as of the Closing,
Buyer shall cause the appropriate U.S. Transferred Company or Viance that is a
party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement to honor the terms of any
Collective Bargaining Agreement covering any of the Continuing U.S. Employees
to which

 



      
 

 



 

it is bound and to continue to provide any compensation or employee benefits
required to be provided under the terms of any such agreements. With respect
to those Continuing U.S. Employees whose services are performed pursuant to an
employment agreement that is a Transferred Company Benefit Plan, effective as
of the Closing, Buyer shall cause the appropriate U.S. Transferred Company or
Viance to honor the terms of such employment agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall ensure that, at all times following the Closing, each
Continuing U.S. Employee receives full credit for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accruals (solely, in the case of benefit accruals, for
purposes of determining vacation and severance) for all service that was
recognized by the U.S. Transferred Companies or any of their Affiliates under
Benefit Plans with respect to such employee under each of the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs or policies of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the U.S. Transferred Companies) in which such employee becomes or
may become a participant, provided that no such service recognition shall
result in any duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) During the U.S. Continuation Period, Buyer shall, or shall cause the U.S.
Transferred Companies and Viance to, maintain the Rockwood Specialties Inc.
Severance Pay Plan and the Viance, LLC Severance Plan, respectively, pursuant
to which the Continuing U.S. Employees who currently are eligible to
participate will be eligible to continue participation under substantially
identical terms and conditions.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall establish or maintain, or cause
to be established or maintained, one or more group health plans (the " _Buyer
Health Plans_ ") which shall cover all Continuing U.S. Employees and
dependents who immediately prior to the Closing were covered under any group
health plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates. With respect to any
Buyer Health Plans that are self-insured and, to the extent commercially
reasonable, with respect to any insured Buyer Health Plans, Buyer shall cause
such Buyer Health Plans to (i) waive any waiting period and any exclusion or
limitation for preexisting conditions which were covered (generally and/or
specifically as to any individual) under any group health plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) grant credit (for purposes of annual
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket limits) for any covered claims
incurred or payments made prior to the Closing Date during the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, in each case, to the extent all information
reasonably necessary to implement such actions has been received from Parent.

 



 

(e) (i) Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each Continuing U.S.
Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Rockwood Retirement Plan to roll over
such eligible rollover distribution as part of any lump sum cash distribution
into an account(s) under a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates
(the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_").

 



 

(ii) If the Closing occurs before Parent PSP Contributions and Parent
Nonelective Contributions for the 2013 plan year have been credited to
participant accounts under the Rockwood Retirement Plan, then with respect to
each Continuing U.S. Employee who is a participant in the Rockwood Retirement
Plan on the Closing Date and who continues or has continued employment with
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the U.S. Transferred Companies)
through December 31, 2013, Seller shall in its discretion, at the

 



      
 

 



 

time such contributions are made with respect to the 2013 plan year, either
(A) credit such Continuing U.S. Employees balance under the Rockwood
Retirement Plan with an amount equal to the Continuing U.S. Employees 2013
Parent PSP Contribution and Parent Nonelective Contribution or (B) transfer to
Buyer for payment by Buyer (or by its Affiliates) to such Continuing U.S.
Employee an amount in cash equal to the Continuing U.S. Employees 2013 Parent
PSP Contribution and Parent Nonelective Contribution.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Parent PSP Contribution nor the
Parent Nonelective Contribution, nor any assets or liabilities associated
therewith, shall be reflected in the Final Closing Statement or be taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(f) Following the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay to the Continuing U.S.
Employees, collectively, such aggregate amount with respect to Parents or any
of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) bonus plans for the
bonus plan year in which the Closing occurs (the " _Bonus Plans_ ") as are
reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and taken into account
in the calculation of the Final Closing Statement; and (ii) provide each
Continuing U.S. Employee with a bonus opportunity (subject to achievement of
applicable performance targets) for the portion of the bonus plan year in
which the Closing occurs, if any, that occurs from and after the Closing Date,
that is no less favorable than the bonus compensation amounts applicable to
such Continuing U.S. Employee under the Bonus Plans immediately prior to the
Closing. Any amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.4(f) shall be
paid at such times and in such manner as such amounts would have been payable
under the Bonus Plans.

 



 

(g) Upon reasonable request and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, Parent shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall provide to
Parent, such documents, data and information as may reasonably be necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 9.4 and to administer their
respective benefit plans.

 



 

9.5 _Non-U.S. Labor and Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall, effective as of the Closing, provide the Sachtleben Pigments
Oy Pension Fund with a contribution or guarantee in an amount sufficient to
cover any underfunding of the Sachtleben Pigments Oy Pension Fund (
_Sachtleben Pigments Oy:n El akesaatio_) as of the Closing Date and to obtain
the release of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. from the Standby Letter of Credit, dated
March 19, 2013 issued by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. in favor of the Sachtleben
Pigments Oy Pension Fund.

 



 

(b) Upon reasonable request and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, Parent shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall provide to
Parent, such documents, data and information as may reasonably be necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 9.5 and to administer their
respective benefit plans.

10.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all provisions hereof will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither this
Agreement nor any right, interest, or obligation hereunder may be assigned by
any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party, except
that (a) Buyer may assign any right hereunder, in whole or in part, to any
Subsidiary of Buyer Guarantor (without limitation or release of Buyers
liabilities hereunder) and (b) Parent may assign any right hereunder, in whole
or in part, to any Subsidiary of Parent Guarantor (without limitation or
release of Parents liabilities hereunder); _provided_ , _further_ that no
party hereto or successor or assignee shall have the ability to subrogate any
other Person to any right or obligation under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment or subrogation in violation of this Agreement shall be null and
void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
10.4, Buyer may assign its indemnification rights pursuant to Section 8.2(g)
in respect of an Acquired Site in connection with any sale, disposal or other
transfer of any such Acquired Site; _provided_ that it shall be a condition of
such assignment that such assignee agrees to be bound by and be subject to the
limitations of this Agreement.

 



 

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Letter and
any Schedule or Exhibit hereto or thereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents contain the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
supersede all prior written or oral

 



      
 

 



 

commitments, arrangements or understandings with respect hereto and thereto
(other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will terminate at the Closing
but survive any termination of this Agreement). To the extent the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and/or the
Ancillary Documents conflict, the terms and provisions of this Agreement will
control.

 



 

10.6 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may only be amended or modified in
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment or
modification is sought. No waiver of any covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty made herein shall be effective or valid unless expressly waived in
writing by the party who might assert such breach. The waiver by any party
hereto of any term or provision of this Agreement will not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any provision, failure, breach or default not
expressly identified in such written waiver or any subsequent failure, breach
or default. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, each
of which will be deemed an original and which shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



 

10.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and each Ancillary Document shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New York, without regard to any conflicts of law rules or
principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that
would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, except
for mandatory Legal Requirements applicable to the transfer of the Shares and
except to the extent otherwise provided in the Lease Agreements.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.27(i), each party hereto hereby consents
to, and confers exclusive jurisdiction upon, the courts of the State of New
York and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the
Borough of Manhattan, City of New York in the State of New York, and
appropriate appellate courts therefrom, over any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (including any Proceeding
brought by a Seller Related Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby against a Financing Source). Each
party hereto hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such
Proceeding that it is not subject to such jurisdiction or that such Proceeding
may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document may not be enforced in or by said courts
or that its Assets are exempt or immune from execution, that such Proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of such Proceeding is
improper (including with respect to Proceedings brought by a Seller Related
Party against a Financing Source). Parent and Buyer covenant not to initiate
or support (and agree not to permit any of their Affiliates to initiate or
support) any such Proceeding in any other jurisdiction. Service of process in
any such

 



      
 

 



 

Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the State of New York, by notice in accordance with Section 10.3.

 



 

(c) Each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement (including with respect to any Proceedings brought by a Seller
Related Party against a Financing Source). Each party (i) certifies that no
Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of a Proceeding, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver; and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties
hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this paragraph.

 



 

10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize that any breach of
the terms of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable harm for which money
damages may not be an adequate remedy, and accordingly agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in addition to all other
remedies available to it, any nonbreaching party shall be entitled to seek to
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance in the courts contemplated by Section 10.8, this being in addition
to any other remedy at law or in equity.

 



 

10.10 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_.

 



 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the singular shall be
held to include the plural and vice versa; (ii) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereunder", and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Letter)
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article, Section,
Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits, and
Schedules to this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter unless otherwise
specified; (iii) references to a "party" or "parties" shall mean Buyer or
Parent, or both of them as the context requires; (iv) the word "including" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including,
without limitation," unless otherwise specified; and (v) the word "or" shall
not be exclusive.

 



 

(b) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement and any
and all agreements and instruments subject to the terms hereof, the parties
understand and agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated,
prepared and drafted, and if at any time the parties hereto desire or are
required to interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement
or instrument subject hereto, no consideration will be given to the issue of
which party actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of
this Agreement or any agreement or instrument subject hereto.

 



 

10.11 _Third Person Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set
forth in Section 8.7(b) and Section 8.7(d); and (b) the Financing Sources are
express third party beneficiaries of, and are entitled to rely on and enforce
as such the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 10.8. Each of Buyer and Parent may
assert the rights of Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees, respectively,
pursuant to Article VIII hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

10.12 _Representations and Warranties; Disclosure Letter_. Neither the
specification of any Dollar amount in the representations and warranties set
forth in Article II nor the indemnification provisions of Article VIII nor the
inclusion of any items in any Schedule of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed
to constitute an admission by Parent or Buyer, or otherwise imply or create
any presumption, that any such amounts or the items so included are material
for the purposes of this Agreement, or that any such item meets any or all of
the criteria set forth in this Agreement for inclusion in such Schedule to the
Disclosure Letter or any other Schedule to the Disclosure Letter. Nothing in
the Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the scope of any representation
or warranty of Parent set forth in Article II of this Agreement or Buyer set
forth in Article III of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed with respect
to any other Schedule of the Disclosure Letter to the extent the relevance of
such disclosure to such other Schedule of the Disclosure Letter is reasonably
apparent. Any capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Letter or any Schedule
hereto or thereto but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

10.13 _Severability_. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement
is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be
affected thereby, and Parent and Buyer will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable provisions
which insofar as practicable implement the purposes and intent hereof. To the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each party waives any
provision of applicable Legal Requirements which renders any provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

 



 

10.14 _NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES_. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND
IN THE LEASE AGREEMENTS, PARENT MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, AND PARENT HEREBY DISCLAIMS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
(INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE), WHETHER BY PARENT, THE OTHER SELLERS, THE TRANSFERRED COMPANIES, THE
NON-CONTROLLED COMPANIES, THEIR AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY OTHER PERSON, WITH
RESPECT TO THE TRANSFERRED COMPANIES, THE NON-CONTROLLED COMPANIES, THE
BUSINESS, THE SHARES, THE MINORITY INTERESTS, THE BUSINESS ASSETS, THE
LIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS OR THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR
ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO
BUYER, ANY AFFILIATE OF BUYER OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION (INCLUDING ANY PROJECTIONS OR DUE DILIGENCE REPORTS) BY PARENT,
THE OTHER SELLERS, THE TRANSFERRED COMPANIES, THE NON-CONTROLLED COMPANIES, OR
ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY

 



      
 

 



 

OTHER PERSON WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. NOTHING HEREIN
SHALL LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF ANY PARTY FOR FRAUD.

 



 

10.15 _Buyer Guaranty_. Huntsman Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer
Guarantor_ ") irrevocably guarantees each obligation of Buyer, and the full
and timely performance by Buyer of its obligations, in each case, under the
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance, and Buyer Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that
this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of
Buyers liabilities and obligations (other than in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, as applicable), whether by
decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the continuing
validity and enforceability of this guarantee. Buyer Guarantor hereby waives,
for the benefit of Parent, (i) any right to require Parent, as a condition of
payment or performance of Buyer Guarantor, to proceed against Buyer or pursue
any other remedies whatsoever and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by
Legal Requirements, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or
afforded by Legal Requirements that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is
available to Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer Guarantor understands that
Parent is relying on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement. The
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(a) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ to Buyer Guarantor as if it was the Buyer referred to
therein.

 



 

10.16 _Parent Guaranty_. Rockwood Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent Guarantor_ ") irrevocably guarantees each obligation of Parent, and
the full and timely performance by Parent of its obligations, in each case,
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance, and Parent Guarantor acknowledges and
agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or
extinguishment of Parents liabilities and obligations (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, as
applicable), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will
affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee. Parent
Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of Buyer, (i) any right to require
Buyer, as a condition of payment or performance of Parent Guarantor, to
proceed against Parent or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by Legal Requirements, any defenses or benefits that
may be derived from or afforded by Legal Requirements that limit the liability
of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such
defense is available to Parent under this Agreement. Parent Guarantor
understands that Buyer is relying on this guarantee in entering into this
Agreement. The representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.3(a)
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to Parent Guarantor as if it was the Parent
referred to therein.
